introduction

the defendant is charged that “on or about the 1st day of
october, 2023,...did operate a conveyance while their ability to operate it
was impaired to any degree by alcohol, or a drug, or both, contrary to
section
320.14
of the
criminal code of canada.

the defendant pled not guilty on december 9, 2024. a trial followed and
the case was adjourned for judgment. on march 17, 2025, i found the defendant
not guilty and the reasons for this decision are set out below.
overview

on october 1, 2023 at 4:08 a.m. the police were dispatched to mclauglin
road, just south of derry road. the officers arrived on the scene at 4:20 a.m. a
vehicle was stopped in the left turn lane for derry road. the defendant was in
the driver’s seat. he was not conscious. the vehicle was running. the defendant
was awakened and he came out of the vehicle at the direction of the police.

the officers on scene, including the arresting officer, did not smell
alcohol.

the arresting officer arrested the defendant for impaired operation by
drug at 4:38 a.m. at 4:41 a.m. the arresting officer made a section
320.28(2)(a) demand that the defendant comply with the requirements of an
evaluation
conducted by an
evaluating officer.

the defendant was taken to a police station and after speaking to duty
counsel was seen by an
evaluating officer.
there was no issue that this
officer, officer emilie anderson, was a qualified
evaluating officer.

the
evaluating officer
conducted an
evaluation.

by the end of her
evaluation
the
evaluating officer
held
the opinion that the defendant’s ability to operate a conveyance was impaired
by alcohol and a drug.

with regard to the drug aspect of the
evaluating officers’
opinion
it was also her opinion that the category of drug involved was
central
nervous system (cns) stimulant. as a result, in order to further
investigate this, she gave a urine sample demand under section 320.28(4)(a),
identifying the type of drug as being a
cns stimulant.

the
urine sample was analyzed at the centre for forensic science (cfs). a
toxicologist from cfs testified. a number of drugs were detected in the
defendant’s urine. for this case it is significant that the following were
“detected”: cocaine; benzoylecgonine, an inactive breakdown product of
cocaine; and cocaethylene, an active metabolite of cocaine.
the issues

given
that defendant was not conscious at the time he was found in the conveyance,
regardless of the cause of him not being conscious, his ability to operate a
conveyance was impaired given he was unaware of his circumstances and unable to
respond to his circumstances. essentially in that moment he had no ability to
operate a conveyance.

the
issue is whether the crown has proven that, at this same point in time, the
defendant’s ability to operate a conveyance was impaired to any degree by
alcohol, or a drug, or both.
positions of the parties

the
crown position is that it called reliable evidence that proves the charge. 
with regard to the drug aspect, the crown relies as well on the presumptions in
section 320.31(6) and asserts that the presumptions have not been rebutted.

the
defendant’s position is that he fell asleep. he set out a narrative about how
this happened, the last stage of which involved him being in the left turn lane
for turning onto derry road, and waiting a long time for the left turn signal.

as
part of this, the defendant denies having any cocaine in his system at the
relevant time and he submitted that for the crown to prove this allegation the
police should have taken a blood test and that the urine test is incapable of
showing this drug was in his system at the time in question.

the
defendant does not deny that he consumed alcohol but he asserts he was not
impaired by alcohol and that the crown does not have the evidence to prove
this.

implicit
in these submissions is the suggestion that the evidence is neither reliable
enough nor sufficient enough to prove the charge, and that the defendant’s
evidence about october 1, 2023 and his evidence about his pre-existing medical
condition raise a reasonable doubt.
other issues
defendant self represented

mr.
takov represented himself on this trial.

as
a trial judge i had an obligation to endeavour to ensure that the defendant had
a fair trial.

this
obligation is the same regardless of whether a defendant assertively chooses to
represent himself or he chooses this route because there was no alternative. nonetheless,
i have raised this point because in a brief review of the case law in the area,
i noticed that in some of the cases there is a subtle suggestion that the
defendant, by choosing to represent himself, may have some responsibility for a
problem(s) or inadequacy that played out during the trial.

i
have every reason to believe that, for mr. takov, representing himself was not
a choice of his choosing, but rather a choice that is a result of his
circumstances. he testified that he applied for legal aid and was turned down.
he has been on the ontario disability support program for a number of years. i
received a document that shows for the month of october, 2024, that his income
from the program was $1,286.00 (basic needs $786 plus shelter $500). i would
hope/expect that this income would likely meet the financial qualifications for
legal aid. however, as a person with no criminal record and on a case where he
likely would not be seen as facing incarceration, i have reason to believe that
legal aid would not be available in this case. this outcome is common place on
charges of this nature. it is also common place in self-represented judicial
pre-trials for similarly situated defendants to be advised that applying for
legal aid is a waste of time. i have no reason to think that mr. takov could
afford a lawyer privately.

i
wish to assert that with mr. takov, i had no concerns that he represented
himself for any reason other than necessity. i did however have a number of
concerns about how to achieve a fair trial for him, which i deal with below,
but none of these concerns were caused by mr. takov. i have outlined his
overall position on the issues above. he was consistent in these positions
throughout and he, as far as i could tell, tried his very best to represent
himself appropriately.

for
my part i endeavoured to conduct a trial that kept the crown accountable, that
allowed the defence to be brought out with full force and effect, and where i
completed my own responsibilities, especially in the area of assessing the
evidence.
playing video of evaluation

the
crown called the
evaluating officer.
it was not the intention of the
crown to play the video of the
evaluating officer’s evaluation.

i
made an enquiry, near the beginning of the
evaluating officer’s
evidence,
and learned that the defendant had not seen the video of the
evaluation,
as
part of disclosure. this was not surprising because, at least in this
jurisdiction, videos are not given to self-represented defendants. they are
expected to make an appointment to come in and view videos. i have no idea if
the defendant was aware of this. i also question the adequacy of this one-time,
play-through, opportunity, if one is preparing for trial.

the
crown offered to take a break in the trial and set the defendant up to view the
video. after some discussion everyone agreed that the video would be played as
part of the crown’s case and that it would be stopped intermittently to align
with the
evaluating officer’s
evidence. the video became an exhibit.

i
note that no
voir dire
regarding voluntariness was held so the
defendant’s statements in the video are not part of the trial evidence for
their truth. they are part of the trial only for the fact that they were said
to the officer while involved in the
evaluation
itself.

given
that we worked the solution out, on consent, i did not need to make a ruling
about the video being part of the crown’s case. with the benefit of hindsight,
i do not know how, in this self-represented trial, i could have undertaken my
responsibility to assess the
evaluating officer’s
evidence, without the
video. the video had shortcomings: some inherent, such as the impossibility of
showing eyeballs; and some preventable, such as conducting the finger-to-nose
test with the defendant’s back of his head in the direction of the camera.
nonetheless, being able to see it was essential for my work.
medical evidence

when
the defendant testified, one of the things he raised was his brain surgery from
a number of years ago. i asked him if he had any medical records available. he
texted his mother, from the witness stand, and shortly after that some records
were received.

i
made these records an
exhibit, without any additional formalities. they
will be reviewed later in the judgment. for the moment, i simply note that my
review of them is from reading them combined with utilizing online medical
dictionaries.
drug evaluation and classification program manuals

i
had a duty to assess the
evaluating officer’s
evidence. there is nothing
unusual about this. a trial judge assesses credibility and reliability of every
witness, including experts, in every case. i struggled however with how to
assess the reliability of the
evaluation officer.

by
way of background, section 320.12(d) of the
code
specifies that “an
evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer is a reliable method of
determining whether a person’s ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a
drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug.”

however,
as noted in
impaired driving and other criminal code driving offences
at
page 380:
nothing in section 320.12(d) specifies that a court must
accept a dre’s conclusion about impairment. although the method may be
reliable, this does not mean that a particular dre in a particular case has
reached a correct conclusion. courts must still assess a dre’s evidence on a
case-by-case basis.

i
found that i was not equipped to do this task. i faced the dilemma of not
conducting a fair trial or finding a source of information to assist me in the
task.

i
chose the latter.

i
chose to rely on two manuals. these manuals are the participant manuals for
officers enrolled in the drug evaluation and classification program, which if
completed successfully, along with completing supervised testing, results in
certification of
drug recognition experts (dre)
by the
international
association of chiefs of police. note: the
evaluating officer
in
this case has been certified through this process. these manuals are:
i)
pre-school: preliminary training for the drug evaluation and
classification program - participant manual (abbreviated to
‘p.s.’
in
citations below)
ii)
dre: drug recognition expert 7-day school — participant manual
(abbreviated to
‘7 day’
in citations below.

these
manuals are published by the
international association of chiefs of police.
i refer to them collectively as
manuals
in this judgment.

i
accessed the
manuals
on-line, at the website of the national highway
traffic
administration
of the us department of
transportation, at
https://www.nhtsa.gov/enforcement-justice-services/drug-evaluation-and-classification-program-advanced-roadside-impaired.

i have attached a copy of a few of the
relevant pages from the
manuals, for reference in this judgment, in the
appendix
to this judgment. other pages need to be accessed through the link,
or another source.

the
appendix
includes:
•
international association of chiefs of
police - drug evaluation and classification program - drug influence evaluation
checklist

(appendix a)
•
a
chart/matrix
entitled indicators consistent with drug
categories

(appendix b)
•
pages (2) from a chapter on central
nervous system stimulants: e. expected results of the evaluation

(appendix c)

i
started down this path of using the
manuals
out of necessity, in order
to conduct a fair trial. after becoming more familiar with the
manuals
and then re-examining the
criminal code
sections, i came to an
additional decision that would apply to every case where there is an
evaluation
pursuant to a
section 320.28(2)
(a) demand.

i
find that the parts of the
manuals
that describe the
12-step drug
influence evaluation, of the
international association of chiefs of
police,
comprehensively
define
the meaning of
evaluation
in
the
criminal code.

this
means that by
definition
the
12-step drug influence evaluation
is,
in effect, part of the
criminal code
in all of the sections that include
the word
evaluation.

the
analysis leading to this conclusion is set out below.
statutory
interpretation
the
issue

this
is a question about the statutory meaning of the word
evaluation
in
the
criminal code.
i have chosen three key sections, involved in an
impaired by drug investigation, to work with. any answer to the question must
make sense for all three sections.
i have set them out in the
order in which they arise over the course of an investigation: initial demand;
the
evaluation; and any subsequent demand for a urine sample.

the
sections are set out below:
1.
section
320.28(2)(a) - if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a
person has operated a conveyance while the person’s ability to operate it was
impaired to any degree by a drug or a by a combination of alcohol and a drug,
or has commuted an offence under paragraph 320.14
(1)(
c)
or (d) or subsection 320.14 (4), the peace officer may by demand, made as soon
as practicable require a person to comply with the requirements of either or
both of paragraphs (a) and (b):
(a) to submit, as soon as
practicable, to an evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer to determine
whether the person’s ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a drug or
by a combination of alcohol and a drug, and to accompany the peace officer for
that purpose
2.
section
320(12)(d) - an evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer is a reliable
method of determining whether a person’s ability to operate a conveyance is
impaired by a drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug.
3.
section
320.28(4)(a) - if, on completion of the evaluation, the evaluating officer
has reasonable grounds to believe that one or more of the types of drugs set
out in subsection (5) —or that a combination of alcohol and one or more of
those types of drugs —is impairing the person’s ability to operate a
conveyance, the evaluating officer shall identify the type of types of drugs in
question and may, by demand made as soon as practicable, require the person to
provide, as soon as practicable. (a) sample of oral fluid or urine …
note: the 320.28(5) drug categories are: depressant;
inhalant; dissociative anaesthetic; cannabis; stimulant; hallucinogen; and
narcotic analgesic.
analysis

for
this analysis
it is helpful to reduce each of the three sections down to
its core purpose:
1.
320.28(2)(a) is a
demand that a person comply with the
requirements of an
evaluation
conducted
by an
evaluating officer;
2.
section 320(12)(d)
confirms that the method required by the 320.28(2)(a) demand (i.e.an
evaluation
conducted by an
evaluating officer)
is a reliable method for
determining whether a person’s ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a
drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug; and
3.
section 320.28(4)(a)
provides that an
evaluating officer
may form the required grounds for a
urine demand if the
evaluation
results provide the required grounds set
out in the section as expanded by subsection (5).

the
starting point for looking at this issue of the statutory meaning of
evaluation,
is the
regulations
of the
criminal code.

section
320.28
of the
criminal code
(
and its predecessor) states that the
governor in council may make regulations: “(f) prescribing the tests to be
conducted under paragraph 320.28(2)(a) and the forms to be used in recording
the results of the evaluation.”

there
is only
one
regulation. it is:
evaluation of impaired operation
(drugs and alcohol) regulations,
sor (statutory orders and regulations)
2008-196, last amended on 2008-07-02. (
regulation)

section
1 of the
regulation
states:
qualification required of evaluating officer
1. an evaluation officer must be a certified
drug recognition expert accredited by the international association of chiefs
of police.

the
international association of chiefs of police,
in the introduction to
the
7 day
course state the following:
when you successfully complete this training, you will be
able to:
•
describe the involvement of drugs in impaired-driving incidents
•
name the seven categories of drugs and recognize their effects
•
describe and properly conduct the drug influence evaluation
•
document the results of the drug influence evaluation
•
properly interpret the results of the evaluation
•
prepare a narrative for the drug influence report
•
discuss appropriate procedures for testifying in typical dre
cases
•
prepare and maintain a relevant and up-to-date curriculum vitae
(cv)
before you can be certified as a dre [drug recognition
expert], you will have to demonstrate that you can do each of these things.

(
emphasis added
)

it
is very important to note, and it is a point that will be revisited in this
judgment the
drug recognition expert/dre
designation refers to
the
whole collection
of points above. it is like an ‘umbrella’ designation.
this is important to recognize because when a
dre
is acting in the role of
conducting an
evaluation, in the highlighted points in the paragraph above,
they are still called a
dre, but their expertise is circumscribed to the
role of an evaluator, as described in the standardized evaluation procedure
discussed below. therefore, they have no expertise that allows them to add,
change, or ignore any part of the “drug influence
evaluation
” or how it
is to be conducted.

the
above establishes the meaning of a
certified drug recognition expert
accredited by the international association of chiefs of police and in lock
step with that who is an
evaluating officer
in the
criminal code
sections
set out above.

the
next question is what is the
drug influence evaluation
being
referred to in paragraph 52, above? (i.e. what is it according to the
international
association of chiefs of police
?)

the
drug influence evaluation
of the
international association of chiefs
of police
is the
12-step drug influence evaluation
established by
the
drug evaluation and classification program,
which is part of the
international
association of chiefs of police.
going forward in this judgment, i will
refer to it as the
12-step die.

a
list of the 12
steps
in this evaluation
can be found in
appendix
a.
however, the
12-step
die
is much more than this list, as
each
step
in the evaluation is a very detailed and fully standardized
procedure. all of these detailed and standardized procedures are included
in the
manuals.

in
the
12-step die,
the
evaluator
is usually referred to as a
dre.
once again the
12-step die
indicates that this does not change their
role as an
evaluator.

moving
to the question of what is an
evaluation
in the
criminal code
in
the
sections reviewed above, it is instructive to review the drug
demand
section of the
criminal code
prior to june 21, 2018. (in effect
2008-07-02 to 2018-06-20)

this
was section 254(3.1).
as illustrated by the highlighted words below, at
its core, it was essentially the same as 320.28(2)(a).
evaluation
(3.1)
if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to
believe that a person is committing, or at any time within the preceding three
hours has committed, an offence under paragraph 253(1)(a) as a result of the
consumption of a drug or a combination of alcohol and a drug, the peace officer
may, by
demand
made as soon as practicable,
require the person to
submit, as soon as practicable,
to an evaluation conducted by an
evaluating officer
to determine whether the person’s ability to operate a
motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment is impaired by a drug
or by a combination of alcohol and a drug, and to accompany the peace officer
for that purpose.

section
1 of the
regulati
on,
noted above in paragraph 51, then, as now,
defined
what an
evaluating officer
means. (i.e. certified drug recognition
expert accredited by the
international association of chiefs of police.)

section
3 of the
regulation,
under a title of
evaluation tests and procedures
states: “the tests to be conducted and the procedures to be followed during
and evaluation under subsection 254(3.1) of the
criminal code are:” (
see
summary in next paragraph)

there
are a number of subsections and sub-subsections that amount to a list of a
total of 14 items that are either tests or procedures. the list contains
either, very little, and usually no explanation, as to how each test or
procedure is to be conducted. also, the list does not provide any framework as
to how these tests and procedures would be used in an evaluation.

section
254(3.1) was the subject matter of a supreme court of canada decision:
r. v
bingley,
2017, scc 12. in that decision the supreme court held that the
dre’s evidence about the evaluation, including the opinion given, was
expert-opinion evidence that was admissible without a need for a
mohan voir
dire.

it
is interesting to note that:
i)
throughout the
decision, the only
evaluation
ever referred to, directly or indirectly,
is the evaluation the dre was trained to conduct i.e.
12-step die.
ii)
one example of this is:
 “that parliament has established the reliability of the 12-step drug
evaluation by statute…..”

iii)
also, there is no
mention, in the decision, of the list in section 3 of the
regulation.

i
am going to interrupt the interpretation of
evaluation
for a moment in
order to include some points about
dres
made in
bingley,
that
still apply today. they are:
(i)
a
dre’s determination is a result of administering the prescribed evaluation.
that is the only expertise conferred on a dre

(ii)
the
focus of the analysis at trial must be on the dre’s administration of the
evaluation, not on the reliability of the steps underlying the evaluation,
which have been prescribed by parliament

(iii)
the
statutory framework does not change a trial judge’s role regarding expert
evidence and examples include: absence of standardized approach can affect
weight of a dre’s evidence; and this may include being unable to explain how an
opinion was determined based on the 12-step evaluation

(iv)
there
are a number of possible issues that may arise in assessing a dre’s evidence
including: the officer may fail to conduct the drug recognition evaluation in
accordance with his or her training; and a dre may draw questionable inferences
from his or her observations


returning
the question of the statutory interpretation of
evaluation
the next
thing that happens is the enactment of the current provisions of the
criminal
code
in this area.

in
addition to the three sections that i have set out above there were other
provisions including s. 320.31(5) – admissibility of evaluation officer’s
opinion.

also,
it should be noted that section 3 of the
regulation
(i.e. the list of
tests and examinations) which refers specifically to section 254(3.1)
has
not
been amended, revoked, replaced or tied to the new provisions in the
criminal
code
in any way. this can be viewed as a good thing given the inadequacies
of the list and the fact that in some respects it was in conflict with the
12-step
die
given the list did not include
step 1 - breath test
and the list
included a romberg balance test, whereas the
12-step die
uses the
modified romberg balance test.

taking
all of the above into consideration, i find that the statutory interpretation
of the word
evaluation
in the
criminal code
sections being
reviewed, is one, and only one, very specific evaluation — the
12-step
drug influence evaluation
(
as determined by the
international
association of chiefs of police - drug evaluation and classification program).

given
this interpretation, then the condensed version of the three sections, used
above to illustrate the core purpose of each section, would be:
1.
320.28(2)(a) is a
demand that a person comply with the
requirements
of the
12-step
die
conducted by an
evaluating officer.
2.
section 320(12)(d)
confirms that the method required by the 320.28(2)(a) demand (i.e. the
12-step
die
requirements
conducted by an
evaluating officer
)
is a
reliable method for determining whether a person’s ability to operate a
conveyance is impaired by a drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug.
3.
section 320.23(4)(a)
provides that an
evaluating officer
may form the required grounds for a
urine demand if the
12-step die
results provide the required
grounds.

it
follows that the interpretation, or definition, of
evaluation,
in all of
the other sections in the
criminal code
in this area, is the
12-step
die.
access
to the 12-step die

given
the conclusion that the
12-step die
defines
evaluation
in the
criminal
code,
like any law or legal definition, one needs to be able to access it.

i
accessed the
12-step drug influence evaluation
in parts of the
manuals.
i found the
manuals
as part of a collection posted on the usa, department
of transportation, website. the
manuals
are interspersed with other
aspects of dre training so navigating through them the first time to find all
of the parts of the
12-step die
was very challenging and very time
consuming, but it is doable once one gets the hang of it.

i
tried to see if i could access the material on the
international association
of chiefs of police
website. i found some things, including a tab entitled
the
international drug evaluation & classification program - recognized by all
fifty states in the us, canada, the united kingdom.
following this link one
finds out how to become a member of the
dre
community, but i could not
find materials about the
12-step die, or any related material. i was
left with the impression that the only way to get this material through the
international
association of chiefs of police
is to sign up and pay for
dre
training.

i
do not think police forces are an appropriate place to research canadian law
but i did check a few to see what they posted as representing
12-step die.
the ones i found were very condensed and occasionally contained inaccuracies.

every
drug recognition expert certified by the international association of chiefs of
police have the
manuals. these participant manuals are the basic
reference documents for their training and certification.

do not, however, anticipate the
dres
having manuals with them in
court. part of their training includes training on being a witness in court and
the
manual
instructs them “
do not bring manuals
or articles into
the court”.

(
emphasis added)

the
last point is interesting but it is also a bit of a ‘red herring’ because
witnesses, lay and expert, give evidence and they are not sources of the law.
the evidence
arresting officer

please see paragraphs 3 - 5 above, and paragraph
97.
evaluating
officer
background

the
evaluating officer
in this case was cst emilie anderson. she is a
certified drug recognition expert accredited by the
international
association of chiefs of police. her certificates were exhibits on the
trial. i will refer to cst anderson as the
evaluating officer
throughout
these reasons.

after
conducting an
evaluation,
the
evaluating officer
formed the
opinion that the defendant’s ability to operate a conveyance was impaired by
alcohol and a drug and she identified the drug category as being a
cns
stimulant (central nervous system stimulant).

as
i decided above, an
evaluation
under the
criminal code
is the
12-step
die.

the
12-step die
is a detailed, fully standardized procedure.

when
reviewing the
evaluating officer’s
evidence below, i also reviewed each
step
of the
12-step
die.
i used the following headings:
•
the
12-step die. (i selected relevant standards. this
means that i am not providing a comprehensive review in all instances. (i do
not, for example, set out the standardized script for the
walk and
turn
test, the standardized mechanics of examining eyes etc.))
•
the evidence. (this includes the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence and the video made of the
evaluation.)
•
comments.

in
order to facilitate an understanding of the
12-step die
and the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence, i will begin by reviewing key concepts and definitions
in the
12-step
die.

the
following is a suitable starting point:
all human beings are different, and a “normal” or “standard”
human does not exist. however, experience and scientific studies have produced
an average range of values, or expected values, of non-impaired people that can
be used for comparison purposes.
in the drug evaluation and classification (dec) program we
use the terms average value or expected range.
•
average value is a single value that represents the middle of the
range that the majority of healthy, non-impaired people would exhibit. this
means when all the sizes were measured using the dre protocol in a large number
of pupils in healthy, non-impaired adults, the average pupil size was
approximately 6.5 mm.
•
expected range describes a range of values above and below the
average for the majority of healthy non-impaired people. the average pupil
size in near-total darkness is 6.5 mm, but the “expected” range is 5.0-8.5 mm
for healthy or non-impaired person.
normal can be used to describe conditions that are not
measured numerically such as muscle tone.
for dres, the closer the finding is to the average value,
the more likely the person is not exhibiting impairment in that function. the
farther away from the average value and nearer the edge of the expected range,
the more likely the person is exhibiting impairment in that function.

in
the glossary of terms, impairment is defined as follows:
impairment: one of the several items used to describe the
degradation of mental and/or physical abilities necessary for operating a motor
vehicle.

a
significant part of the
12-step die
is about
indicators
that may
be consistent with any one of seven possible
drug categories.

firstly,
there are
major indicators:
for
dre
purposes,
major indicators
are
physiological signs specifically addressed and are, for the most part,
involuntary,
reflecting the status of the
central nervous system (cns)
homeostasis.
(
emphasis added)

the
major indicators
of drug impairment are:
•
horizontal gaze nystagmus (hgn)
•
vertical gaze nystagmus (vgn)
•
lack of convergence (loc)
•
pupil size
•
reaction to light
•
pulse rate
•
blood pressure
•
body temperature
•
muscle tone

secondly,
there are
general indicators:
for
dre
purposes,
general indicators
are
behaviours or observations of the subject observed, and not specifically tested
for.
major
and
general indicators
are of equal value in making a
decision in the totality of the evaluation.


there
is a
chart/matrix
in the
12-step die
that summarizes which
major
indicators
are expected, and which
general indicators
may be
present, with each of the seven drug categories.
(see chart/matrix,
appendix
b)

the
general indicators
for the
cns stimulant
category are: anxiety;
body tremors; dry mouth; euphoria; exaggerated reflexes; excited; eyelid
tremors; grinding teeth (bruxism); hyperactivity; increased alertness;
insomnia; irritability; redness to the nasal area; restlessness; runny nose;
talkative.

the
12-step die
cautions the
dre/evaluator
to be on the lookout for
medical conditions - both physical and mental. it emphasizes that: some
conditions mimic drug impairment (i.e. have the same indicators); and sometimes
it is a case of both a medical condition and drug impairment. major possible
medical conditions are discussed in detail, but it is emphasized that the list
of possibilities is long (2,500 to 12,000 diseases and conditions) and that the
dre
should look and enquire closely at all times (i.e. go beyond the
standard medical questions in the
12-step die
if anything is noticed)
also, medical impairment is a possible opinion from an
evaluation
in
step
11 - opinion
of the
12-step die.


the
following is also instructive:
the location of the injury or disease will determine the
signs and symptoms — for this reason, we cannot generalize a set of specific
signs and symptoms for a condition as we do with the drug categories. in many
injuries or diseases, the effects will be seen primarily on one side of the
body. this is the one-sided (lateralized) sign. impairment due to drugs will be
seen on both sides.
the evaluation of the defendant mr. takov

the
evaluation
of the defendant
is reviewed below in the same
sequence as it took place with the defendant. however, the
step
numbers
used are from the
12-step die
process.
step 2: interview of arresting officer

the
evaluating officer
did this
step
at 5:16 a.m. the defendant was
not present. a summary of the information received includes:
•
times: offence 4:07 a.m.; arrest 4:38 a.m.;
dre demand
4:41
a.m.;
•
scene: defendant located slumped over wheel, sole occupant of
car, woken by police, looked startled, asked to exit;
•
observations
at the
scene: no
alcohol detected, when questioned driver said had a brain aneurysm; some drool
seen; sweaty; speaking very quickly. (note: no evidence given to suggest
defendant had any difficulty staying awake after he woke up.)
step 1: breath alcohol test
the 12-step die

this
is
step 1
in the
12-step die.
it like all of the other
steps
is
an essential part of completing the standardized evaluation process. it
requires a
single
breath test.

the
purpose of obtaining the subject’s
bac
(
blood alcohol concentration)
is
to determine whether the specific drug, alcohol, may be contributing to the
impairment observed in the subject.


upon the
bac
being
obtained the
dre “
is to assess whether alcohol may be the sole cause of
the observable impairment or whether it is likely some other drug or drugs, or
other complicating factors, are contributing to impairment”.

the evidence

the defendant
entered the room at approximately 5:29 a.m. the
evaluating officer
began
by asking some
step 3
and
step 10
type of questions. (what had he
eaten that night, what happened that night, what time is it now?) the officer’s
explanation for doing these things, at this time, is that she was multitasking.

the
evaluating
officer
testified that she noticed fidgeting at this time and went on to
say:
while i do the background, and throughout the entirety of
the evaluation, i am observing him. i just want to note, so at some point in
my notes, i note that he is fidgeting. he fidgets throughout it. i know this
seems like a minor observation, but again, with respect to the totality,
the
fidgeting is going to be one of those checklist items. and that was at
5:30.
(step 10) (
emphasis added)

note: the
officer is correct that she was expected to make observations throughout. these
observations are meant to be collected in
step 10.
the evidence wasn’t
presented that way so for purposes of writing this judgment i will simply mark
each of them as
(step 10) as
they arise in the evidence review.

with regard to
having the defendant provide a breath sample the
evaluating officer
testified:
i)
having
already testified about the setting up of the intoxilyzer 8000 c in advance,
she stated “and the first step to the drug recognition evaluation is going to
be a breath test. so, i’m just getting it ready just in case we need to do a
breath test.”

ii)
“
so,
at this point, i detect an odour of alcohol, so i go ahead, and i read the
breath demand, which is going to allow me to do an intoxilyzer test to check
for alcohol, which is what i’m about to do.”


the defendant
began his attempt to provide a sample at 5:32:35 a.m. the test was completed at
5:34:44 a.m. (total time involved = 2 minutes.) the result was 69 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

the
evaluating
officer
testified regarding this time: “…fidgeting like crazy. so, the
observations there it’s a little more exaggerated while he is blowing.”

(step 10)

turning to the
video evidence, it shows that during the two minutes, 5:32:35-5:34:44, there
are portions where the defendant appears to be blowing into the machine, where
the defendant exhibits an action that is hard to put into words. there is
movement throughout his body. when he is not blowing this movement is not
happening.

during this time
the defendant apologies and mentions asthma. the officer tells him that he is
fidgeting like crazy. the defendant says “
because i have nerve problems
(inaudible)
and [has/had] asthma”. (emphasis added) the
evaluating officer
asks how
old he is. the defendant says 31. the
evaluating officer
re-instructs
him about how to blow. he provides a sample. during this last blow his body is
moving again, but he is steadier than before.

when the
evaluating
officer
testified that the reading was 69 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, she noted that he was over the
highway traffic act
limit
of 50 and the under
criminal code
limit of 80, so “i elected to proceed
with the drug recognition evaluation, as the symptoms that i’m seeing are not
consistent with a blood alcohol concentration of 69 milligrams of alcohol in
100 millilitres of blood.”


the defendant
had been in the room for a total of 4 minutes at this point.
comments

the
evaluating
officer
acted in accordance with the
12-step die,
given she obtained
the defendant’s
bac
and she turned her mind to the necessary judgment call
and she made it.

i think that my
description, in paragraph 107 above, of the defendant’s body movements while
blowing is more accurate than the
evaluating officer’s
description of
“fidgeting like crazy”.

the testimony
quoted above is a bit vague but
if
the
evaluating officer
was
asserting that the defendant was fidgeting throughout the whole
evaluation,
then
i disagree, based on observations made of the video going forward.

the evaluating
officer stated: “—the fidgeting is going to be one of those checklist items”
see paragraph 102 above. my understanding of a ‘checklist’ is a pre-determined
list of items that may be observed, and if observed, are checked off in some
manner. there is no such ‘checklist’ in the
12-step die.
in fact, the
only ‘checklist’ is in
appendix a.
perhaps she was referring to the
chart/matrix
in
appendix b,
but i note that i) it is not a ‘checklist’ and ii)
when one looks at the
general indicators
across
all
of the drug
categories listed, ‘fidgeting’ does not appear.
step 3: preliminary examination and first
pulse
the 12-step die

the following
provides an overview of
step 3:
“the preliminary examination consists of a series of
questions dealing with possible injuries or medical problems, observations of
the subject’s face, speech, and breath, and an initial examination of the
subject’s eyes.”


the eye tests at
this stage are:
pupil size; looking for any
resting nystagmus
(involuntary eye movement); and whether the eyes track together.

pupil size
is significant because it is one of nine
major indicators
of drug
impairment. this initial evaluation is not the one used for this purpose
however. rather, the
pupil size
assessment is as described in
step 7
below.

the
12-step
die
also describes this
step 3
as a “fork in the road” regarding
whether to continue the
evaluation,
pursue a possible medical
complication or proceed with just an alcohol case.

the evidence

from the video i
observed that when asked about illness or injury the defendant described a
lingering shoulder injury from a car accident and gave many details about his
brain surgery from 13 years ago including: metal plates at the back of
neck/spine; removal of tangled blood vessels; long recovery; current effect of
when over-tired his body shuts down; and not on medication.
when asked about
balance he said the aneurism [the tangled blood vessels] was in the balance
part of his brain. when asked he responded that he could stand on one foot.

the
evaluating
officer
then checked the defendant’s pupil size and they were normal at 4
millimetres. as well she observed that he had no
resting nystagmus. the
evaluating
officer
did not check eye tracking during this stage. she may have checked
it when she began the eye examination in
stage 4. this is unclear to me
from the video and her evidence is silent on this point.

the
evaluating
officer
took the defendant’s pulse and she testified that it, and the other
two that followed, was within the
dre
average range of 60-90 beats per
minute.

the
evaluating
officer
testified to observations/indicators that she characterized as
small/minor. this included fidgeting throughout, quick speech, and a bit of
slurred speech.
(step 10)

my observation
of the defendant on the video is that when he was talking about his medical
circumstances etc. he was quite animated and also talking with his hands and he
frequently pushed his hair back with a hand. i did not notice fidgeting. i did
not notice any slurring.
(step 10)

also, i observed
that for the eye exam and the taking of his pulse, that followed immediately
after the verbal exchange, he sat very still and quiet. this was also true for
the eye examinations that follow in
step 4.
(step 10)
comment

it is
unnecessary to quibble about the details of the
evaluating officer’s
observations.
i do however take exception to her evidence that the defendant fidgeted
“throughout”.

i find that the
evaluating
officer’s
enquires about any lasting effects from the defendant’s brain
surgery was minimal, especially given how the
12-step die
refers to this
step being a “fork in the road”. (see paragraphs 94 and 118 above.)

my comments
about the defendant’s pulse are found in
step 6 - vital signs.
step 4: eye examinations
horizontal gaze nystagmus (hgn)
the 12-step die

hgn
is
the involuntary jerking of the eyes occurring as the eyes gaze to the side.
according to the
12-step die, with
hgn
there are only two
possible results from the test.
hgn
is either
present
or
none
(meaning it is not present).


the
hgn
result
expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
none.

the evidence

the
evaluating
officer
testified that she observed
hgn
when she tested for it, i.e.
hgn
present.
comment

the
evaluating
officer’s
observation of
hgn
present
is the
opposite
of the expected result of
none
for someone who is impaired by a
cns
stimulant.

vertical gaze nystagmus (vgn)
the 12-step die

vgn
is an
involuntary jerking of eyes (up and down) which occurs as the eyes are held at
maximum elevation. the jerking should be distinct and sustained.


with
vgn
there
are only two possible effects according to the
12-step die. vgn
is
either
present,
or
none (meaning it is not present).


the
vgn
result
expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
none.

the evidence

the
evaluating
officer’s
testified that she observed
vgn,
i.e.
vgn
present.
comment

the
evaluating
officer’s
observation of
vgn
present
is the
opposite
to the expected result of
none
for someone who is impaired by a
cns
stimulant.

lack of convergence (loc)
the 12-step die

loc
is
the
inability
of a person’s eyes to converge, or “cross” as the person
attempts to focus on a stimulus as it is pushed slowly toward the bridge of his
or her nose.


with
loc
there
are only two possible effects according to the
12-step die:
loc
is
either
present
(i.e. eyes do
not
cross),
or
none
(meaning it is not present)
(i.e. eyes do cross)


the
loc
result
expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
none.

in other words, a
cns s
timulant does not affect the ability to cross
one’s eyes.
the evidence

the
evaluating
officer
testified as follows:
•
i also see a lack of convergence in his right eye. convergence
is when your eyes cross, so when i’m doing the circles around his face and i’m
bringing the pen towards his face, your eyes, if you are not on drugs, or not
under the influence of a drug, should cross. his left eye goes inwards, and
right eye goes inwards, but then pops back out.

•
and then the lack of convergence, once again, your eyes should
converge on a sober person. there is a percentage of the population where it
doesn’t do so, but that’s why this is a cumulative test. and as i indicated,
his left eye is able to converge, his right eye is not.

comments:

leaving aside
the details for a moment, the
evaluating officer
in her testimony took
the position that there was
loc
present.

the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence of
loc
present
is the
opposite
to the expected result of
none
for someone who is impaired by a
cns
stimulant.


turning to
another issue, i find that it was very appropriate for the officer to record
the details about the right eye movement and lack of converging. thereafter,
however, i find that the
evaluating officer’s
evidence about
loc
is
flawed, and further that she stepped outside of the
12-step die
to
support her opinion.

in support of my
opinion, i note the following:
•
the
12-step die
calls for a clear choice about
loc -
present
or none;
•
for this test there are no
expected ranges (
see definition
in paragraph 86 above). consistent with this, the
12-step die
does
not
refer to any type of study along the lines suggested by the officer;
•
the choice of
present or none
clearly refers to both eyes,
producing a single result;
•
there is no provision in the
12-step die
for dividing the
results between eyes;
•
the suggestion even defies common sense, it is like clapping
hands with one hand;
•
the
evaluating officer’s
evidence suggests that the right
eye result can be used as part of “a cumulative test”. (see second quote in
paragraph 140 above);
•
i do not know what she is talking about, nor what cumulative test
she is talking about;
•
my best guess is, the
evaluating officer’s
position is
that the right eye result can contribute to the overall opinion of impaired by
a drug and in this case impaired by a
cns stimulant;
•
i believe that this position is not supported by the
12-step
die, and that the officer therefore is not complying with the
12-step
die
when she advances this position;
•
as reviewed above, the
12-step die
states that impairment
due to drugs will be seen on both sides of the body, not just on one side. (see
paragraph 95 above.) also, a problem on one side of the body is more indicative
of a medical issue. this further illustrates that the
evaluating officer
went down a path that is not consistent with the
12-step die;
and
•
the
12-step die
calls upon
dre’s
when acting as an
evaluator
to follow the standardized process both in how they do tests and standardized
result options. an
evaluator
does not have the ability/expertise to
change the standardized process, nor, could anyone else. changes or
modifications are antithetical to a standardized process.
step 5: divided attention tests
the 12-step die

there are four
divided
attention tests
and they are used in the “drug influence evaluation
process”.


the results are
not part of the
major or general indicators
on the
chart/matrix
of
drug categories. (see
appendix b
)

with these tests
the
12-step die
indicates that the
dre
should record “clues”. for
example, with the
walk and turn test
it
has lists of things to
look for under “instruction stage clues” and “walking stage clues”.

modified romberg balance (mrb)
the 12-step die

the test
requires the subject to stand with feet together and the head tilted back
slightly and with the eyes closed. it also requires the subject to estimate 30
seconds and the subject is instructed to open his eyes and tilt his head
forward and say ‘stop’ when they think thirty seconds has elapsed.


regarding the 30
second aspect: “performance outside of the range of plus or minus 5 seconds
should be used cautiously and considered with the totality of the decision
process.”


any swaying
during the test is also recorded. to record swaying the
dre
must
estimate how many inches the subject sways either front-to-back, left-to-right,
or circular.


there is no set
standard or other assistance in the
12-step die
as to how to assess any
swaying. oddly, even though in the standardized script the subject is told to
stay in the assigned position for the 30 seconds, the subject in not told to
try to be exact about not moving at all.

the
dre
is expected to also record other observable activity.
the evidence

the
evaluating
officer
testified that:
•
she measured the actual time to be 35 seconds and indicated that
this was within the
dre average
•
the defendant’s eyelids were fluttering, after having been told
to keep them closed, and this is an
indicator
(
step 10)
•
there was a circular sway of about one inch

the
evaluating
officer
testified that: “so, no swaying is normal. there’s no such thing
as normal, in that it’s just an observation. we have people who are all the way
on the side.”


the
evaluating
officer
testified that: “if you watch his left hand, he’s twitching his
left hand while i’m giving instructions there, again just a
general
indicator.”

(emphasis added) (
step 10)
comments

the
evaluating
officer’s
statement, in paragraph 154 above, about swaying is internally
inconsistent. further, the suggestion that no swaying is normal is not
supported by the
12-step die
which does not make any assertion of what
is normal, or even average, for a non-intoxicated person doing this particular
test.

the
evaluating
officer’s
statement in paragraph 155 above, “
he’s
twitching his left
hand” grammatically suggests that the defendant had control of this action, as
opposed to it being an involuntary action. also fluttering one’s eye lids is
normally a voluntary action.

also, when one
looks at the
general indicators
across
all
of the drug categories
listed, ‘twitching’ does not appear and ‘fluttering eyelids’ does not appear.
walk and turn (wat)
the 12-step die

this test has
two phases.


the first is the
instruction phase where the subject stands heel to toe (right foot in front)
and arms at sides.

the second phase
involves taking nine heel-to-toe steps on the line (while watching feet),
turning around keeping the front or lead foot on the line and to turn by taking
a series of small steps with the other foot, and to return nine heel-to-toe
steps down the line.

the
12-step
die
provides very specific instructions regarding how the
dre
is
expected to record and diagram “
clues
”.

(emphasis added)

instruction
stage “clues” include:
•
not maintaining balance during instructions (i.e. while standing
heel-to-toe)
•
starts too soon

walking stage
clues include:
•
stops while walking
•
does not touch heel-to toe (one-half inch or more) (including
number of times)
•
steps off the line including number of times
•
improper turn
•
wrong number of steps
the
evidence and comments

the
evaluating
officer
testified that the defendant:
•
broke balance once during instructions (comment: on the video
this doesn’t look like a balance issue. it looks like possibly a social
response issue where the defendant pulled his front foot to the side as the
evaluating
officer
approached him while walking on the line toward him)
•
started too soon once (comment: i could not see this movement on
the video)
•
did not stop walking
•
missed heel-to-toe twice during first nine steps, and once during
the second set of nine steps (comment: i could not see this on the video given
the way it was taken. also, i am not convinced the
evaluating officer
could see clearly at certain points. this was a small, confined area and the
evaluating
officer
ended up, more or less, behind the defendant at certain points.
lastly, the officer did not say anything about the distance being one half inch
or more as described in the
12-step die, and once again i question her
ability to even see this at certain points.)
•
did not step off the line
•
did not raise his arms
•
turned in the wrong direction (comment: there is no right or
wrong direction. in this case he turned around his back foot rather than his
lead foot. otherwise, he did it correctly, i.e. small steps while staying on
the line. i think it is questionable whether there was room to do this maneuver
on his lead foot given that by then he had arrived at, or was very near, the
end of the line and the line itself was angled toward, and close to, a filing
cabinet and a wall.
•
took nine steps.
one leg stand
the 12-step die

this
test is done on each leg and has two phases: instruction; and balancing and
counting stage.


the
second stage involves balancing on one foot with the other foot raised approximately
6 inches off the ground, with the raised foot parallel to the ground. the
subject must look at the raised foot and count one thousand and one, one
thousand and two etc. until told to stop. this goes on for 30 seconds.

the
details of the counting is to be recorded. in the
12-step die
the
following “clues” have a specific way of being recorded.
•
sways while balancing
•
uses arm(s) to balance
•
hopping
•
puts foot down

the
12-step
die
indicates that the
dre
should be observant for the presence of
other indicators, such as body tremors and improper counting during the test.
the
evidence

the
evaluating officer’s
evidence is:
•
she asked him to raise his right leg first and he raised the left,
and completed the test. it was the same switch when she then asked him to raise
his left leg;
•
during the first one, (i.e. left leg raised and standing on right):
 he swayed with his foot up; he did not use his arms for balance; he hopped
once; he put his foot down on his count of seven seconds; and his counting got
to 17 seconds in a 30 second
time period;
•
“his hand was twitching the whole time he’s doing his left leg”

(i.e. his left leg raised and standing on his right); and
•
with the second leg (i.e. right raised and standing on left) the
only “marker” was he swayed while balancing, “and that’s all i have for this
one”.

comment

the mix up
regarding which leg to raise appears to be the defendant following the
demonstration of the
evaluation officer
in front of him (i.e. he follows
a mirror image as opposed to the verbal instruction). the
evaluating officer
accentuated her raised leg by tapping her thigh.

in the video one
can see a discussion with the defendant about him saying he had weak ankles, after
years of recovery [from surgery]. the
evaluating officer
watched the
video of the statement in court and did not make any comment about it.

the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence is also silent regarding the counting on the second leg.

i note that this
is the second time (first time is the
loc
issue) where there is a
substantial difference between the defendant’s left and right side. there was
almost no problem when he was standing on his left leg and there were a number
of things noted when he was standing on his right leg.
finger to nose (ftn)
the 12-step die

here
the subject is required to assume a specific posture and close his eyes and
then move the tip of an index finger to the tip of his nose when instructed to
do so. this is done six times, (three times on each side) and the examiner
records the part of the finger that makes contact and where.

the evidence

the
evaluating
officer
testified: “…i have to tell him to return his hand to the side
each time. again, small indicator of impairment, just building on the
impairment here.”


the
evaluating
officer
also testified that she was very explicit. “the tip of your finger
is here, tip of your nose, so as i indicated, he doesn’t do that several times.
and he touches other places on his nose, other signs of impairment.”


using the
transcript, because i can’t see his face on the video (i can only see back of
his head), a summary of each hand is:
•
left hand:
1.
tip of index finger
under nose then tip of nose
2.
tip of index finger on
tip of nose
3.
tip of index finger on
tip of nose
•
right hand:
1.
tip of index finger on
the bridge of nose and then tip of nose
2.
tip of index finger
touches under nose
3.
tip of index finger
under nose
comment

the defendant
had substantially more difficulty with this task on his right side. this is the
third time where right side problems were evident. (others were
loc
and
one
leg stand
tests)
step
6: vital signs and second pulse
the
evidence

the
evaluating officer
testified that the defendant’s: pulse was 80 beats
per minute; blood pressure was 130 over 90 milligrams hg, and his temperature
was 36.9 degrees celsius. she testified that all of those are within the
dre
average.
the 12-step die and comments

all
three of these items are
major indicators
in the
12-step die.

with each of
them, the results for the defendant
do not
match the expected
result for someone under the influence of a
cns stimulant.

•
pulse rate: expected for
cns stimulant
is
up;
the
defendant was
normal
•
blood pressure:
expected for
cns stimulant is
up;
the defendant was
normal
•
body temperature: expected for cns stimulant is
up;
the
defendant was
normal.
step
7: dark room evaluations
pupil
size
the
12-step die

the first dark
room evaluation is the
estimation
of pupil size under three lighting
conditions, or levels: room light; near total darkness; and direct light.

(emphasis added)

the examination
involves both eyes, in three lighting conditions, and the
12-step die
calls
for only
one
opinion:
for pupil size, there are three possible effects that might
be seen. the pupils might be normal (within the dre average ranges). or, the
pupils might be dilated. or, they might be constricted.


the
pupil
size
result expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
dilated.


additional
12-step
die
information:
•
it is made very clear that this is an
estimate
of size. it
follows that it is not a ‘measurement’
of size.
•
there is a
dre
average range provided for each lighting
condition (room - 2.5 - 5.0 mm; near total darkness: 5.0 - 8.5 mm; direct
light 2.0 - 4.5 mm)

•
the estimate is made using a pupillometer. this is a card held to
the side of a subject’s head that has dark circles usually ranging from 1.0 mm
to 10.mm in half millimetre increments. (example: at 4 mm the next highest is
4.5 mm with the difference being.5 mm. as a reference, i note that 5 mm is the
width of a line drawn using a 5 mm tip pen.)
the
evidence

the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence is:
i)
in regular room light
both of his pupils were 3.5 mm and she found this was within the dre average
ii)
in near total darkness
both of his pupils were 4.5 mm. she noted that the dre range is 5 mm to 8.5 mm
and the defendant was below this range
iii)
in direct light his
pupils were 2.5 mm which she found to be within the dre average
iv)
the
evaluating
officer
did not
express
one
opinion about his
pupil size
as required by the
12-step die
(see paragraph 184 above)
comments

i could not find
anything in the
materials that suggests this problem could happen, i.e.
that the eyes could be in more than one range. (note: the
12-step die
makes
adjustments for what is normal in each lighting condition. see paragraph 186
above.)

the
evaluating
officer
seemed to be oblivious to the expectation of one result. unsurprisingly,
she did not speak to the discrepancy.

in my attempt to
reconcile the evidence i noted that with the near total darkness estimate that.5 mm is a very small amount, and that this very small amount moved the
estimate outside of the normal range to constricted.

more
importantly, the
evaluating officer’s
observation of
pupil size
normal
(and possibly barely
constricted
on one test
)
is
not
consistent with
the expected result of
dilated
for someone who is
impaired by a
cns stimulant.

reaction to light
the 12-step die

this is a dark
room assessment that takes place between estimating pupil size in near total
darkness and pupil size in direct light. it is an assessment of how the pupil
constricts when the direct light shines into the subject’s eye.

the
12-step
die
provides parameters for three possible results as follows:
there are a number of effects that might be observed in the
pupils’
reaction to light. the pupils might react in a
normal
manner, ie, by constricting somewhat in one second or less. or, the pupils
might react
slow, ie, by constricting somewhat, but requiring more than
one second to do so. or, little to no reaction. (note: bold in original.)

note: on the
chart/matrix
“
little or no reaction” is called “little or none visible”.

the
reaction
to light
result expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
slow.

the evidence

the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence regarding the defendant’s
reaction to light
is:

however, his reaction to the light is slowed, so it should
take less than one second for your eyes to go back and constrict, his are
slowed.

also, the
evaluating
officer
described her use of black light during this test given that the
defendant has dark eyes and she was unable to see his pupils without this aid.
comments

the
evaluating
officer
did not
use the
12-step die
parameters (see paragraph
193 above):
i)
12-step die: “
constricting somewhat”
v
officer:
“eyes to go back and constrict”
ii)
12-step die: “
in one second or less”
v
officer: “
less than one second”

given the lack
of more detail in the evidence combined with the
evaluating officer
not
using the
12-step die’s
parameters,
i find that the result of this
test is unknown.
step
8: check muscle tone
the
12-step die

the
12-step
die
indicates:

evidence of muscle tone may be apparent when the subject
attempts to perform divided attention test. it may also be observed when taking
the subject’s pulse, blood pressure, or while examining for injection sites.

the
12-step
die
lists three possible effects:
normal, flaccid
and
rigid.


the
muscle
tone
result expected if the subject is impaired by a
cns stimulant
is
rigid.
the
evidence

the
evaluating
officer
testified that when she checked, it [muscle tone] was normal muscle
tone and “it’s not rigid”

comment

the
evaluating
officer’s
observation is the
opposite
to the expected result for
someone who is impaired by a
cns stimulant.

step
9: check for injection sites and third pulse
the
12-step die

this is a check
of the subject’s forearms.
the
evidence

the
evaluation
officer
checked the defendant’s arms and nothing was found.
comments

for the pulse
aspect of this step, please see
step 6: vital signs
above.
step
10: interrogation, statements, and other observations

any statements
made by the defendant are in the review above.

other
observations
have been noted during the review of previous
steps,
using
(step 10)
as a demarcation.

leaving aside my
comments about some of this evidence for the moment, the
other observations
that were identified above included fidgeting, a hand twitching, quick speech
and eye lids fluttering.

the
evaluating
officer
connects 3 of these 4 things in her evidence, to her opinion
regarding a
cns stimulant.

i just want to point out, you can kind of see it in this
video. his eyelids are moving, they’re fluttering, also an indicator. so, at
the end of this drug recognition evaluation, the drug category that i call is a
stimulant, also very indicative of a stimulant, so the twitching, the fast
speech, fluttering of the eyelids.
comments

i infer from the
quote in the paragraph above that the
evaluating officer
is indicating
that the three things she identified “the twitching, the fast speech,
fluttering of the eyelids” are each a
general indicator
of the effect(s)
of a
cns stimulant.

when one refers
to the
chart/matrix
of indicators consistent with drug categories (see
appendix
b
)
none
of these things is on the list.

one might ask
the following: ‘given that the
evaluating officer is
certified as a
drug
recognition expert,
can she give an opinion that fast speech, twitching and
fluttering eyelids are each a general indicator consistent with a
cns
stimulant,
when they are not listed on the
chart/matrix?

i believe the
answer to the question is: ‘no, she cannot’. the reason is that as an
evaluator
under the
12-step die
her certification, in this context, means that
she is certified to
conduct
the standardized
12-step
evaluation
and to prepare the standard reports.
(drug influence evaluation
and
drug
influence evaluation narrative).
the umbrella title of being a
drug
recognition expert
does not affect this circumscribed role of an
evaluator.

the
12-step
die
states:

standardization helps to ensure no mistakes are made. there
are no steps omitted and
no extraneous or unreliable “indicators” are
included. standardization helps to promote professionalism among drug
recognition experts (dres). standardization helps to secure acceptance in
court. (emphasis added)

i also note that
when one looks across all of the drug categories on the
chart/matrix
(appendix b)
‘twitching’ is never mentioned. speech is mentioned in many categories
but never as
fast speech. (
the others are: thick slurred speech;
difficulty with speech; slow slurred speech; and slow, thick, slurred speech.)
step
11: opinion of evaluator
the
12-step die

the
dre
is
expected to prepare two reports. the ability to prepare and read these reports
is tested in examinations and field work as part of becoming certified. the
reports are:
•
drug influence evaluation
•
drug influence evaluation narrative.

at the bottom of
the
drug influence evaluation
form

there is a box entitled ‘opinion of evaluator’ followed by the following tick
boxes:
•
not impaired
•
medical
•
alcohol
•
cns depressant
•
cns stimulant
•
hallucinogen
•
dissociative anesthetic
•
narcotic analgesic
•
inhalant
•
cannabis

in the
drug
influence evaluation narrative,
the opinion is always expressed in the following format, without any
further explanation:
dre’s opinion: it is my opinion as a certified drug
recognition expert the (name of subject) is under the influence of a (name of
category eg. cns stimulant) and is unable to operate a vehicle safely.

there is no
specific direction given in the
12-step die
as to how a dre
ultimately
comes to an opinion after completing all of the previous
steps
in the
evaluation.
there is, however, the following guidance:
i)
based
on
all of the evidence and observations
collected from the preceding
steps, the d.r.e should be able to reach an informed opinion as to whether the
subject is under the influence of a drug or drugs, and if so the probable
category or categories of drugs causing the impairment. the dre must record a
narrative summary of the facts framing the basis for their opinion. (emphasis
added)

ii)
based on
the
totality of the evaluation, the dre should form an opinion of the
subject’s impairment and, if impaired, the drug category or categories
responsible.

(emphasis added)

there is also
the following guidance:
….they [persons impaired by a drug
category or categories] usually will exhibit indicators of impairment. 
individuals that are impaired exhibit numerous indicators of impairment. in
other words, they generally do not exhibit the dre average range or expected
values for the related indicators.


there is one
specific direction given regarding an opinion. it is with regard to alcohol:

anytime there is a positive bac reading during the
evaluation, the dre
must
list alcohol (etoh) as part of their
opinion. (emphasis added)

with each drug
category a summary is provided in the
manuals. the summary regarding
cns
stimulants
is attached as
appendix c.

the
manuals
also include a
chart/matrix
of
major and general indicators
across all drug categories. (
appendix b
)
the
evidence

the following
are transcript excerpts, from december 10, 2024, relevant to the
evaluating
officer
being asked in examination in chief about her opinion:
•
so, as you can see, i just told him, based on the totality of the
drug recognition evaluation that i had just completed, it is my opinion that he
is indeed impaired by alcohol and a drug, which then allows me to read the
urine sample demand….

•
i end up making the call that the drug category that i believe he
is on is a stimulant, which is then reflected in the toxicology report as well.

•
so, it would have been the arresting officer’s grounds as well as
my drug recognition evaluation, and again totality of the drug recognition
evaluation.

•
q. …
did you use the drug recognition
expert matrix
in your analysis at all?
a.
i
did. so, so, the matrix shows you across all the drug categories what you
see
consistently. so, you would see - and i don’t have it in front of me so i don’t
want to ballpark it - but where, you know, a stimulant you might see a higher
blood pressure whereas a narcotic
you might see a low blood pressure et cetera. so, it helps me make my call as
to which category of drug the impairment is by.

(emphasis added)
comments

when one looks
at the
chart/matrix, one can see that over the entire course of her
testimony, the
evaluating officer
testified to zero of the
general
indicators
of
cns stimulants
shown on the
chart/matrix.
(appendix b).

the following is
a summary of what i reviewed above regarding
major indicators.
it
is structured in the same way as the
chart/matrix.

evaluating officer

this chart shows
an almost complete mismatch of what would be expected for a
cns
stimulant
and what has been reported by the
evaluating officer.
going with
what the officer apparently believed regarding
reaction to light
being
slow, this would mean there was
only one match
on the chart above.

the
evaluating
officer
testified that she used the
chart/matrix (appendix b)
when
she formed her opinion of
impaired by cns stimulant.
what she would have
had in hand by this point, was one
major indicator
of a
cns stimulant,
and zero
general
indic
ators.

for my part,
given the above, i do not accept the evidence indicating that the
evaluating
officer
“used” the
chart/matrix.

also, the
evaluating
officer’s
opinion flies in the face of
12-step die
guidance reviewed
above:
•
consider all of the evidence and observations (paragraph 221 above)
•
impaired persons exhibit numerous indicators (paragraph 222
above)
•
going the other way they generally do not exhibit the average
range or expected values for related indicators (paragraph 222 above)

the
evaluating
officer’s
opinion regarding alcohol is consistent with the
direction
given in the
12-step die.
(see paragraph 223 above.)
cfs toxicologist

nadia pace who
is employed by the centre of forensic science was found qualified to give
expert evidence in the field of toxicology.

she gave opinion
evidence about the urine sample taken during the
evaluation.

please see
paragraph 10 above for these results.

ms. pace agreed
with the defendant during her cross-examination that she cannot give an opinion
based on a urine sample about when drugs were ingested or when they had an
effect on the defendant.
the defendant

before i begin
to summarize the defendant’s evidence i note that the summary looks more like a
connected narrative than the transcript does. i think a number of things contributed
to this.
•
the defendant speaks quickly and a number of times i had to
interrupt him in order to take notes.
•
after two days of being an advocate for himself, he was inclined
to interrupt his narrative to include an opinion that he felt was necessary and
perhaps more important than the question at hand.
•
at the same time as he was testifying he was focused at one point
on getting medical records. while i was getting something copied, unknown to
me, he was texting his mother in an effort to do this.
•
the defendant believes, correctly in my opinion, that he is a
unique individual. as a result, he seems to have a tendency to think he is not
understood and it affected how he approached answering some of the questions
where he drifted into to more territory than anyone would expect.

nonetheless, the
defendant, in the end, presented one, internally consistent, narrative about
the time of the alleged offence and his medical history.
summary
of defendant’s evidence

the defendant
testified that on september 30
th
he was invited to a girl’s house.
(note: the defendant provided an address that makes sense in terms of the
where the police found him, but i am leaving it out of these reasons). he went
to the girl’s house. he met her family. he and the girl ate, hung out, and
watched movies. he drank a tall boy beer
around 11 [p.m.].
they
were on a bed, and between it being late at night, and the movies
being boring, he kept falling asleep and the girl kept trying to wake him up.

sometime around
3:30 and 4:00 [a.m.] he woke up. he decided he wanted to get home and sleep in
his own bed. he just left as he did not want to wake anyone up.

he went out to
the car he had been driving. it belonged to his grandmother. it was a
volkswagen jetta tdi. he was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. it was cold so he
pulled on a pair of pants he had in the car and he cranked up the heat and the
seat warmer. he also noticed that he was low on fuel. the car ran on diesel
fuel and in cross-examination he explained the problems associated with letting
a diesel engine run out of fuel. given that he needed diesel fuel he decided to
take a route home where he could get the fuel by going on derry road to mavis
road.

all of this led
to him being in the left turn lane for derry road, on his route to find fuel.
he was waiting for a long time for the signal to change, he was tired/half
asleep, and he was sitting in a very warm car on a heated seat, and he fell
asleep until he heard a police officer banging on his window.

after he opened
his
window he was shocked by being grabbed and
surrounded by the police. he tried to explain the situation but he was treated
like a major criminal, was arrested and his grandmother’s car was searched and
impounded.

he was taken to
the police station.

he was tested at
the police station and after the tests he was notified that he was impaired. he
also says he was told that he blew over. he does not agree with this and says
the breath reading did not show a criminal offence, maybe a
highway traffic
offence
and “…..these indicators that they claim is just me. i’ve had
central nervous system damage for many years, from you know, from these
aneurysms.”

also, “…. i know i had problems in my central nervous system, twitchy
little, you know, nerve reactions. that’s just been normal for me. slurring,
you know, if i wake up, as you guys see, i have a totally different way of
talking until i wake up.”

(note: this last statement was made in the context of a few minutes earlier
in court, asking for permission to bring his coffee to the witness stand.)

i asked him why
he was on disability. he said it was still for his brain aneurysm.

he explained his
medical history as follows:
•
he collapsed and was in icu, with a coma, for a week in 2009;
•
when he went home his mother became his caregiver;
•
because of the state of his brain, some time elapsed before
proper scans could be taken;
•
he was diagnosed with an avm, and understood there were tangled
blood vessels that had hemorrhaged in his brain stem. the aneurysm was in the
balance part of his brain;
•
he had to wait but he had brain surgery at toronto western 2
years after that (i.e. 2011);
•
the surgery was successful;
•
his physical recovery for things like relearning walking took
about two years;
•
he described the time period from the original crisis to this
point as “being a vegetable in bed” and that his mother was his caregiver; and
•
he continued to have some physical symptoms like twitching plus
some other health issues over time including difficulties with his mental
health that he didn’t have before all of the above happened.

i asked him if
he was prepared to address things seen on the video including “…when you are
trying to blow on the intoxilyzer, the act of exhaling fully, you start to
twitch. do you have any explanation for that?” a. “that’s just how i am, your
honour, in general. i don’t even know. i have so many things i can’t even count
on my fingers. you know, my legs start twitching sometimes. i know i am fidgety
always.”

he also suggested a history of asthma.

he also
addressed the toxicology results and asserted that it had nothing to do with
the time he was driving and
any marihuana
use
and cocaine use was at least 72 hours prior.

the defendant
emphasized that he does not have a criminal record. he also testified about
doing community service work and brought some letters with him. he basically
asserted he was of good character and that he is trying his best to continue to
do better, but he remains disabled and he says that his doctor, who provides
the forms for his disability claims, has a guarded opinion about his future.
the defendant’s medical
records

i have reviewed
the hospital records submitted by the defendant. the following comes from
extracting information from the reports.

in september of
2011 the defendant had a suboccipital craniotomy at toronto western hospital.
my understanding is that this a surgery that allows a surgeon to access an area
within the base of the skull by removing the occipital bone. in the defendant’s
case the reports suggest this surgery was to access and repair a vascular
malformation. thereafter, using a microsurgical
technique,
an
avm nidus was resected and removed. my understanding from checking
online is that avms are arteriovenous malformations that are defects in the
vascular system, consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (nidus) in
which the feeding arteries are directly connected to a venous drainage network
without interposition of a capillary bed.

there is also
radiology report from an mri procedure done on march 22, 2014. the author of
the report was aware of the above noted surgery and had access to an mri of
july 6, 2010 and a ct scan dated september 8, 2011.

one of the
findings in this report, which is approximately 2.5 years after surgery is:
“post surgical changes are noted in the medial aspect of the
left
cerebellar hemisphere with encephalomalacia and
gliois.

this is a
reference to the cerebellum, as opposed to a cerebral hemisphere. according to
the merriam-webster online medical dictionary the cerebellum is: a large
dorsally projecting part of the brain concerned especially with the
coordination of muscles and the maintenance of bodily equilibrium, situated
between the brain stem and the back of the cerebrum, and formed in humans of
two lateral lobes and a median lobe. (
https://www.meriam-webster.com.medical
)

in the online
harvard health medical dictionary of health terms the cerebellum is defined as:
the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement. (
https://www.health.harvard.edu
)
analyses
the evaluating officer

the
supreme court indicated that the focus of the analyses of any given
evaluation
is on the
evaluating officer’s (dre’s)
administration of the
evaluation.
(see paragraph 66 (ii) above.)

administration
of the
evaluation
means the administration
12-step die,
including
all parts of each
step. these parts include a standardized process of
many things that involve both evidence gathering and interpreting of results: 
eg. scripts, measurements, record keeping, set categories for results,
comparison of results to anticipated results and lastly an opinion.

regarding
my analysis of the administration of the
12-step die,
i note the
following:
•
there are some things where a trial judge is not in a position to
judge the administration of an
evaluation.
the primary example is the
results of various eye examinations.
•
there are some things in this particular case where i was not in
a position to judge the administration of the
evaluation
because of lack
of attention to how the video was created and how the defendant was positioned
vis a vis the camera.
•
a substantial part of the analyses of the
evaluating officer’s
administration of the
evaluation
was done above when i reviewed her
evidence and compared it to the standards of the
12-step die.
(see
paragraphs 96 - 233)
•
there are some points where my comparison of the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence to the
12-step die
may look like ‘nit-picking’.
my response is that details matter in this analyses for two reasons: i)
comparison to a standard cannot be achieved any other way and ii) the
evaluation
is very exacting in terms of every little slip-up of the subject, and the
outcome(s) of this can be very consequential for the subject, so there is every
reason to examine every aspect of the administration of the
evaluation
by
the
evaluating officer
with equal scrutiny.
reliability

i
will begin the analysis of the administration of the
evaluation
by
considering the issue of
reliability.
(i.e. is the evidence of the
evaluating
officer reliable?
)

my
first
concern regarding reliability has to do with the classic questions
in this area: ‘did the witness have the ability to observe?’; ‘did the witness
have the ability to recall?’; ‘did the witness accurately recount this evidence
in court?’.

on
this front, i had the following concerns. each is reviewed in full in the
review of the
evaluating officer’s
evidence above. the list that follows
simply highlights relevant points from
comments
made in that review.
•
step
1:
the
evaluating officer
mischaracterized the defendant’s movements as
fidgeting when he was attempting to provide a breath sample.
•
steps
1 and 3:
the
evaluating officer
gave inaccurate evidence by suggesting the defendant
fidgeted throughout the
evaluation.
•
step
5, heel to toe:
the
evaluating officer
was unable to see the heel and toe proximity at all
times.

my
second
concern stems from the fact that the reliability of an
evaluation,
in
any given case, is achieved by administering the standardized
steps, 1
through 10,
in accordance with all of the standardized procedures. the
flip-side of this is that any method, or opinion, that does not align with, or
misrepresents, the
12-step die,
inherently
raises a
reliability
issue that should be analyzed. my concerns about instances where the
administration of the
evaluation
did not align with, or misrepresented,
the
12-step die
are listed below. once again, each is reviewed in full
in the review of the
evaluating officer’s
evidence above and the list
that follows simply highlights relevant points from
comments
made in
that review.
•
step
1:
misrepresented
the
12-step die
by suggesting i) there is a “checklist” in the
12-step
die
and ii) that it included “fidgeting”.
•
step
3:
lack
of further enquiry regarding medical history.
•
step
4 - eye examination - lack of convergence:
did not have the single result
anticipated by the
12-step die,
and did not acknowledge a single result
anticipated by the
12-step die
and resorted to misrepresenting and/or
adjusting the
12-step die (
including making reference to a “cumulative
test”) and by referring vaguely to a study that is not referred to in the
12-step
die
either directly or indirectly.
•
step
5 - mrb:
made
comments about ‘swaying’ and ‘twitching’ that are not consistent with the
12-step
die.
•
step
5 - walk and turn:
left
out part of the standardized test that a ‘miss’ on the heel to toe aspect is
1/2 inch or more.
•
step
7 - pupil size:
had
more than one opinion about pupil size. did not have the single result
anticipated by the
12-step die,
and did not acknowledge a single result
anticipated by the
12-step die.
•
step
7 - reaction to light:
used a standard that that was different from the standard
in the
12-step die.
•
step
10 - other observations:
suggested that ‘twitching’ and ‘fast speech’ and
‘fluttering eyelids’ are
general indicators
for a
cns stimulant
when
they are not identified as such by the
12-step die.

most of the
items on this list raise a serious reliability issue, not only because of the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence not complying the
12-step die
but because the
majority of them have a potential impact on the evaluation of a
major, or
general, indicator.

my
third
concern is with regard to
step 11 - opinion,
as it concerns
evaluating
officer’s
opinion of ‘impairment by a
cns stimulant
’.

it is important
to keep in mind the opinion options in
step 11.
there is no option of
impairment by a drug. rather the options, regarding drugs, always include
identifying the drug category.

as already
mentioned the
12-step die
materials
have a separate session that
summarizes each drug category according to the various tests. this summary for
cns
stimulants
is attached as
appendix c.
also, as discussed, there is a
chart/matrix
that shows
major indicators
and
general
indicators
consistent with
each of the seven drug categories.
(appendix
b)

the
evaluating
officer’s
results cross-checked with the
chart/matrix
for indicators
consistent with
cns s
timulants shows:
i)
one
(reaction to light)
out of 9
major indicators
matching
ii)
zero
matches
for 16
general indicators

objectively,
when one removes the
reaction to light
result, because it is based on a
standard that does not comply with the
12-step die,
then the results
are:
i)
zero
out of 9 matches for
major indicators
ii)
zero
out
of 16 matches for
general indicators.

another striking
aspect of this is that when one looks at
major indicators,
there is a
potential on 6 (out of 9) of them to have a result of
normal
(pupil
size, reaction to light, pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and
muscle tone). of these 6 areas the defendant’s results are 5
normal
and
one unknown. there are
zero
major indicators
where
normal
is
listed as being consistent with a
cns stimulant.

the
evaluating
officer’s
result
in
step 11-opinion,
that included
impairment
by a cns stimulant
appears to be
totally unreliable
because there
are no matches between what was observed regarding the defendant and the
major
and general indicators
consistent with a
cns stimulant.
the only way
to modify this conclusion would be by adding an additional unreliable result
that used a standard not in the
12-step die.
this would simply reinforce
the conclusion about unreliability.

the
evaluating
officer’s
result
in ‘
step 11 - opinion’,
is, essentially,
a
guess.
it is a guess because there is no apparent reason
for it other than it is one of the seven categories available. i do not know
how, or why, the
evaluating officer
guessed, and i am not going to
speculate about this. i do know there was no apparent downside for guessing. 
if she did not guess there was no case. if she guessed, and guessed wrong (i.e.
no result or different drug category), she was no further behind.
the demand

the
demand for a urine sample was made pursuant to section 320.23(4)(a), during
step
11.
section 320.23(4)(a) provides that an
evaluating officer
may
form the required grounds for a urine demand if the
12-step die
results
provide the required grounds.

the
evidence analysis above clearly shows that the
evaluating officer
in
this case did not have the grounds for a urine demand, based on the
12-step
die
results, given there were no
indicators
to support her opinion.

unfortunately,
finding that there were no grounds is a hollow ruling given:
i)
it does not prevent the
results of the urine test that in fact took place from being part of the
evidence, and given
ii)
the crown does not need
to prove that a valid demand was made under section 320.23(4)(a) for the
presumptions under section 320.31(6) to apply.


as a result, a
failure to properly comply with section 320.23(4) is often addressed through a
charter
challenge.
charter application

between
day one and two of the trial the defendant prepared a document seeking
exclusion of the results of the urine test under 24(2) of the
charter.
there
were a number of bullet points about the problems with urine testing and the
timing of ingesting a drug. his application ends with “given the extended
detection windows of certain substances in urine and the inability of such
tests to establish real-time impairment, the admission of this evidence would
create an undue risk of prejudice and mislead the trier of fact.” he sought
exclusion under section 24(2) of the
charter,
as it [urine test
evidence] would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

this document is
totally in line with the defendant’s cross-examination of the
evaluating
officer
and the toxicologist.

my response was
to say that this argument, about the problems with urine testing, was not a
charter
argument and i also informed him of the presumptions in section 320.31(6)
and i gave him a copy.

what i did not
do, and should have done, was to alert him to considering a section 8 - search
and seizure application seeking exclusion of the results of the urine sample
based on the sample being a warrantless search where the
evaluating officer
had
no grounds, and to ask for section 24(2) exclusion on that basis.

the problem is
that i did not notice the issue at the time. i have since reflected upon how i
missed it.

there was some
evidence that did not sit well with me during the trial. there is no point in
going over the details. this evidence left me with the impression that the
evaluation
unfairly collected relatively few negative points upon which an opinion
could be based. it is bad enough that i blamed a legislatively approved test,
but with the benefit of hindsight it also distracted me from the real issue of
the
evaluating officer’s
grounds.

i think the
primary reason for my inaction is that i did not notice because i had a blind
spot. the blind spot was a failure to fully appreciate that an ‘evaluation’
sourced from an international, non-governmental, association of police chiefs,
is embedded into the canadian
criminal code
(see paragraph 70 above),
and hence is the legally authorized standard for the warrantless searches
that take place, pursuant to a demand under section 320.28(2)(a) for an
evaluation.
this in turn, delayed my action of looking up this legally required standard
for these searches, and becoming knowledgeable about them, until after the
trail.

i also think the
following contributed
to my
delay. i was
careless about the question of ‘what is the
evaluating officer’s
area of
expertise, when testifying about the
evaluation?’
i basically didn’t
give it any thought, but with hindsight i must have more or less assumed that a
drug recognition expert (dre) gives an expert opinion about recognizing drugs
in subjects. i did not adjust the ‘area of expertise’ to the
evaluation
context,
where the ‘area of expertise’ is the administration of the
12-step die.
this
carelessness, in turn, probably contributed to an inappropriate over reliance
on the
evaluating officer’s
testimony and also to less scrutiny of her
testimony, during the trial.

i regret all of
this because, with the benefit of hindsight, as part of trying to conduct a
fair trial i should have raised this
charter
issue with the defendant. i
had no ability to remedy this situation post trial.
section 320.31(6) presumptions

section 320.31(6) reads as follows:
presumption —drug
(6)
if the analysis of a
sample provided under subsection 320.28(4) demonstrates that the person has a
drug in their body that is of a type that the evaluating officer has identified
as impairing the person’s ability to operate a conveyance, that drug—or, if the
person has also consumed alcohol, the combination of alcohol and that drug—is
presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be the drug, or the
combination of alcohol and that drug, that was present in the person’s body at
the time when the person operated the conveyance and, on proof of the person’s
impairment, to have been the cause of the impairment.

essentially
320.31(6) contains two sequential rebuttable presumptions. they are not
automatic. each presumption has evidentiary preconditions.
the first rebuttable presumption

essentially
section 320.31(6) contains
two
sequential
presumptions of fact.

the way a
presumption of fact works, generally speaking, is that upon
proof
of
fact
a, the existence of fact
b
is
presumed.

if, a is not
proven
there is
no
presumption to support
b.
if, a is
proven the presumption is mandatory, but rebuttable
by the affected party
rebutting the presumed fact b. in a criminal case this would also include raising
a reasonable doubt about b. in both instances rebuttal of b is achieved by
calling evidence that is contrary to b and/or relying on some aspect of the
crown’s evidence that is contrary to b.

the first
presumption in section 320.31(6) is: that the drug or combination of alcohol
and a drug was present in the body at the time of operation. unlike the simple
example above, where the proof of a single fact a was required to support
presuming b, for this presumption
there are two, separate,
facts
(preconditions)
that must be proven to support this presumption.

the second
presumption in section 320.31(6) is: that a drug (or combination of a drug and
alcohol) caused the impairment. for this presumption there are three, separate,
facts (preconditions) that must be proven to support the presumption, the first
two of which are the same as the required facts for the first presumption.

returning to the
first presumption, given it is not the simple example of prove a and then
presume b, i found that it was helpful to express the requirements and the
presumption in the form of a
propositional formula
(
formula).

in a generic
form, the
formula
is:
fact a
and
fact b
then
result c
where each of
a,
b and c
are
given a definition from the outset.

before i fill in
a, b, and c,
using 320.31(6), i will make some observations about the
formula.

this
formula
is
not
a calculation because all of the terms, including the
result
is defined from the outset. also, using this
formula
does not involve
any reasoning about the
formula.
this
formula
is entirely focused
on whether
fact a
and
fact b
have been proven. if they are
both proven, then the proposed
result c
happens. if either or both of
the
fact a
or
fact b
are not proven then
result c
does not
happen.

it follows that
if one does not agree with the
formula,
this cannot be resolved by
changing how one uses the
formula,
instead one would have to change the
formula.
the formula and reliability

as just stated,
the exercise with the
formula
is entirely focused on whether
fact a
and
fact b
have been proven.

unsurprisingly,
in a court case proving
fact a
and
fact b
is a matter of having
admissible, credible and reliable evidence to prove each of
fact a
and
fact
b.

for what follows
in the next paragraph, i am going to assume that the evidence, offered as
proof, is admissible and credible and focus on reliability. if the evidence
offered is also reliable this leads to a sound
result.
if one
carelessly, or inadvertently, uses unreliable evidence, the
result
is
compromised.

by using the
formula
and incorporating reliability into it, the following basic logic would
apply:
i)
reliable evidence regarding
fact a
and
reliable evidence regarding:
fact b
then
reliable
result c
ii)
unreliable evidence regarding
fact a
and
reliable evidence regarding:
fact b
then
unreliable
result c
iii)
reliable evidence regarding
fact a
and
unreliable evidence regarding:
fact b
then
unreliable
result c
iv)
unreliable evidence regarding
fact a
and
unreliable reliable evidence regarding:
fact b
then
unreliable
result c

the
only
route to a reliable
result,
is that each of
fact a
and
fact
b
are proven by using reliable evidence. otherwise, it is a ‘
garbage in
- garbage out
’ scenario.

the word
‘garbage’ basically speaks for itself, but i will further clarify the problem
that is caused. in examples ii), iii) and iv) above, the definition of
result
c
does not change from the definition it had at the outset, which means
that when one of these scenarios happen it creates a
latent reliability
issue
in
result c.

this latent
reliability issue is particularly true when the
result
c
is a
presumption (i.e. as in section 320.31(6)). a presumption is a substitute for
something that cannot be determined with the information available, and as a
result of this, it’s reliability cannot be checked.
a presumption’s
reliability is totally dependent upon reliable evidence being used to prove
fact
a
and
reliable evidence being used to prove
fact b.

lastly, if the
crown is allowed to rely on unreliable evidence, in addition to the compromised
presumption, the defendant immediately faces an evidentiary burden regarding
fact
c.
the defendant goes from no burden to this evidentiary burden, on a
fact
that the crown usually is unable to prove without the presumption. it is
often said that the
presumption is not
determinative
of the trial as a whole. on the other hand, it can certainly put a thumb on the
scale.

these problems,
as they relate to
presumptions of fact
(
fact c result),
are a
particularity unfortunate and inappropriate outcome where
fact a or fact b
involves
the evidence of an evaluating officer in an impaired by drug case, given that
there are multiple, and often crucial pieces of evidence, where there is
basically almost no way to cross-examine the
evaluating officer
about
reliability. this includes observations for
all
of the
major
indicators
(5 eye exams, pulse, blood pressure, body temperature,
and muscle tone).

the only way to
minimize the risks discussed above, is to have the crown prove
fact a
and
fact b
based on admissible, credible and
reliable
evidence.
the formula and the first
presumption in section 320.31(6
)

in order to
understand section 320.31(6), it has to be read in the context of the
legislative scheme, including the fact that any reference to
evaluation
is
a reference, exclusively, to the
12-step die.
also, any reference to the
evaluating officer
is as an expert whose sole role, and expertise,
concerns the administration of the
12-step die.

when one reads
section 320.31(6) in this context, it is clear the first presumption as
two
preconditions, drawn from the
12-step die:
1.
the urine sample taken
during
step 11
(referred to as ‘
sample’
below)
2.
the opinion of the
evaluator/evaluating officer during
step 11 (
referred to as ‘
opinion’
below)

as a result,
when structuring the
formula,
i included ‘
sample’
into
fact a,
and ‘
opinion’
into
fact b.

also, when
structuring the
formula:
•
i omitted any reference to alcohol in the section (eg. or
combination of a drug and alcohol) because the section is about drugs and these
extra caveats are distracting
•
i shortened the phrase of “analysis of the sample demonstrates
that the person has a drug in their body” and used “analysis results shows evidence
of [the drug]”
•
i included the specific drug category involved in this case

for the first
section 320.31(4) presumption, the
formula
is:
fact a
and
fact
b
then
result c,
where:
•
fact a
is: sample analysis result shows evidence of
a
cns stimulant
•
fact b
is: opinion identified a
cns stimulant
•
result c
is:
cns stimulant
was present in the
body at the time of operation
did the crown prove
fact a?

did the crown
prove, through admissible, credible and reliable evidence: “
sample
analysis result shows evidence of a
cns stimulant”.

largely thanks
to the work of the
centre for forensic sciences,
who have set up
standardized procedures for receiving and analyzing evidence, and thereafter
making their experts available for court, there usually are exceptionally few
reliability issues with
fact a.

this case
followed these same standards:
•
the toxicologist who testified was qualified as an expert
regarding urine analyses, and thereby able to provide admissible expert
evidence
•
the toxicologist’s evidence showed that:
–
the sample was
received in the standardized manner
–
the sample was
analyzed in the standardized manner
–
her opinion
utilized the evidence and was within her expertise

i found this
witness to be credible and reliable.

finding: 
the crown proved
fact a
beyond a reasonable doubt.
did the crown prove fact b?

did the crown
prove, through admissible, credible, and reliable evidence,: “
opinion
identified a
cns stimulant”.

the sole witness
is the
evaluating officer
and her evidence was admissible as expert
evidence under section 320.15(5).

the
evaluating
officer
testified that after completing the preceding
steps
[
steps
1-
10] that she formed her opinion. this opinion was one of the options
available in the
12-step die,
and part of it included identifying a
cns
stimulant.

this expert
opinion evidence, just like all other expert opinion evidence, does not receive
a ‘pass’ on credibility and reliability. if there are credibility or
reliability issues, the evidence remains admissible but it affects the weight
the trier of fact attributes to the evidence, which in turn may affect the
crown’s ability to prove a fact, in this case
fact b.

what is unique,
in the case of the evidence from an
evaluating officer,
is that there is
a specific route to proving reliability.

if the
evaluating
officer
uses the standardized
12-step die, and follows the standards
it lays out, reliability will very likely be proven.

this does not
foreclose the classic questions of reliability: ‘did the witness have the
ability to observe?’; ‘did the witness have the ability to recall?’; ‘did the
witness accurately recount the evidence in court?’. they become part of proving
the
12-step die
was followed.

it is possible
that small deviations by the
evaluating officer, from the
12-step
die,
depending upon the circumstances, may not affect reliability, and in
turn not affect the weight given to the testimony, when considering whether
crown has proven
fact b.

this
is not
one of those cases.

as i have
detailed extensively above, there are multiple reliability issues about the
administration of the
12-step die
in this case. these issues are capped
off by a
step 11 opinion
about
cns stimulants
that does not align
with the
12-step die indicators
for the same.

given these
circumstances, i am not prepared to give any weight to the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence about
fact b.

it follows that
the crown did not prove
fact b.

given how the
section 320.31(6) is structured, there is no point in moving to consideration
of second presumption. (see paragraph 293.)

i make a finding
that the
presumptions in section 320.31(6) do not apply in this case.

this leads to a
finding that the crown has not proven the part of the case that relates to
impairment by drug.

before moving
on, i note the following. if am wrong, and if for any reason the section
320.31(6) presumptions do apply, i would find that the defendant met his
evidentiary onus regarding rebutting the presumptions by raising a reasonable
doubt. briefly, this would flow the from the following evidence taken
together: the defendant’s evidence about the date in question; the defendant’s
evidence about his medical condition; the medical reports that offer some
corroboration of the defendant’s testimony; parts of the
evaluation,
including
the high number of ‘normal’ findings under
major indicators,
the lack of
indicators
for
cns stimulant;
and the problems that were greater
on the right side of the defendant’s body.
included
offence of impaired by alcohol

the charge in
this case is “…..ability to operate it was impaired to any degree by alcohol,
or a drug, or both.”

given this,
there is still the issue of impairment by alcohol to consider.

i find that the
crown has not proven this offence.

there were
multiple things that contributed to the crown’s inability to prove this
included offence beyond a reasonable doubt, including:
•
officers on scene did not see any indicia of impairment by
alcohol
•
physical tests during the
evaluation
showed more problems
on the right side and the defendant has a brain injury on the left side of his
brain in an area responsible for motion, so the physical tests are of no
assistance regarding impairment
•
there is no evidence relating the breath reading to any level of
impairment
•
evaluating officer
testified impairment not accounted for
by alcohol reading
•
defendants evidence regarding: the day in question; the
evaluation;
and his medical history
•
the
evaluating
officer’s
opinion, where any alcohol
is involved, is a mandatory opinion in the
12-step die
(see paragraph
223)
conclusion

my analysis
above may seem long and tedious, and they may also seem, at least in some
respects, novel.

i assert that it
is not novel because it flows from following the supreme court of canada’s advice
in
bingley.
the court directed that the focus of the analysis at trial
must be on the dre’s administration of the evaluation.

it also stated:
the statutory framework does not undermine a trial judge’s
important role as gatekeeper to safeguard the trial process and ensure that it
is not distorted by improper expert opinion evidence.


the supreme
court also suggested that serious problems with a dre’s administration of the
evaluation could possibly lead to exclusion of the evidence. with section
320.31(5) now in place, this remedy may no longer be available, but it does not
affect the trial judge’s role, as described in
bingley,
of
ensuring
the trial process is not distorted by improper expert opinion evidence.

this is much
easier said than done. as it turned out in this case, i was dealing with a
worst-case scenario, where the
evaluating officer’s
so called ‘opinion
’
was a ‘guess’. even then, it was difficult to detect the ‘guess’, and then
prevent it from distorting the trial process.

i believe i
found a legal pathway for following the advice in
bingley.
it involved
adherence to legal definitions and legal principles, in a specific order. it
began by defining
evaluation
in the relevant sections of the
criminal
code,
and going from there.

i am not going
to review the above analysis point by point, but there is one point in
particular, i wish to highlight, because i think it has the greatest potential
to cause problems with the analysis of the
evaluating officer’s/
dre
’
s
administration of the evaluation.

section
320.31(6) sets out preconditions that need to be satisfied in order to support
a
presumption of fact.
in law, there are
presumptions of law, and
there are
presumptions of fact. the analysis, for a simple
presumption
of fact
is: upon proof of fact a, then the existence of fact b is
presumed. in cases like this one, where there are two preconditions, it is
proof of fact a and proof of fact b, then the existence of c is presumed.

this is not hard
to understand, but it is still very easy to fall into a trap in its application
in section 320.31(6). the trap is set, in every case, when the results of the
urine sample identify the same drug category as was given by the
evaluating
officer.
almost immediately, one’s mind tends to assume that all of the
evaluating
officer’s
evidence has been confirmed and validated.

then, the
collateral effect of this assumption is to cause a short-circuit in the
presumption
of fact
analysis. this short-circuit is along the lines of saying: ‘the
outcome checked out, so why bother examining and analyzing the
evaluation
process?’

the reason for
bothering to do the analysis is that doing otherwise is not following the law
concerning
presumptions of fact
and not following the law creates a risk
of there being a latent problem, that cannot be detected, that in turn can
distort the trial process. (see paragraphs 303 - 305 above.)

the defendant’s
case provides a perfect example of this problem. if one views the analysis of
the urine sample as confirming and validating the
evaluating officer’s
evidence,
then one is, in fact, confirming a
guess,
and not an opinion from the
administration of an
evaluation,
as defined by the
code. this is
the type of distortion of the trial process that a trial judge must guard
against.

this distortion
can happen with not only
guessing,
but also with cases of unreliable
evidence and/or a less than credible witness.

the only way to
guard against the risk of this distortion, given that the presumed fact is
preset, is to require proof, from admissible, credible, and reliable evidence,
of the preconditions. (i.e.
facts a and b
)

are the most consistent with the category. there may be variations due to
individual reaction, dose taken and drug interactions.
1)
soma, quaaludes, and some
anti-depressants usually dilate
2)
etoh, quaaludes, and some anti-depressants
may elevate

e. expected results
of the evaluation [or cns stimulant]
(slide showing the same information, not
reproduced)
major indicators
observable evidence of impairment: horizontal gaze nystagmus (hgn) will not be
present with subjects under the influence of cns stimulants.
vertical gaze nystagmus (vgn) will not be present.
lack of convergence (loc) will not be evident.
performance on modified romberg balance (mrb) should be
impaired.
performance on walk and turn (wat) may be impaired due to
the subject’s hyperactivity and inability to concentrate. example: subject may
start too soon on the wat and may tend to walk fast, thus loosing balance or
missing heel-to-toe.
performance on the one leg stand (ols) may be impaired due
to the subject’s hyperactivity. example: subject may also count very rapidly on
the ols test
performance on the finger to nose (ftn) test should be
impaired. his or her finger movements may be abrupt, jerky, and inaccurate.
vital signs: pulse generally will be increased. blood
pressure will generally be elevated. body temperature generally will be
elevated.
dark room examinations: pupils generally will be dilated.
the technical term for “dilated pupils” in mydriasis. pupil reaction to light
generally will be slow. rebound dilation may be observed.
muscle tone: muscle tone will be rigid.
