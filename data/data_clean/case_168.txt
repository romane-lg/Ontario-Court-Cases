a.
overview

this case concerns whether prabhjot mann
knowingly possessed a loaded, prohibited firearm and magazine found in a duffel
bag in the kitchen of his home on march 20, 2024, upon the execution of a
search warrant by police.

it is admitted

that this handgun was:
(1)
an operable, loaded, prohibited firearm as
defined by the
criminal code
of canada
and related regulations.
(2)
loaded with 17 cartridges of 9mm calibre
ammunition, contained in an over-capacity magazine that is a “prohibited
device” as defined by law; and
(3)
a “weapon” as defined by law.

it is further admitted that the accused:
(1)
did not have any legal authority to possess such
a firearm, ammunition, or magazine. more specifically, he was not a holder of a
firearm licence, authorization, or registration certificate.
(2)
was subject to the terms of a valid and active common
law peace bond on the date and time of the allegations where he is alleged to
have possessed the firearm, ammunition, and prohibited device.

there were no
charter of rights and freedoms
applications
before this court seeking an exclusion of evidence, or a stay of proceedings.
this was confirmed at the commencement of the proceedings.

accordingly, the sole issue at trial for this
court to decide is whether mr. mann had possession of the firearm, ammunition,
and prohibited device found inside the residence. all other elements of the
offences are admitted through the agreed statement of facts.
b.
police observations of prabjot mann and the blue duffel bag where
the firearm was found

the crown called four police witnesses in
support of its case: constables o’connor, elford, beccario, and angevine. each
officer provided testimony regarding their respective roles in the surveillance
and search operation that culminated in the recovery of the firearm and related
items.
a)
the evidence of constable o’connor

constable o’connor was assigned to conduct surveillance on mr.
mann beginning on march 16, 2024, as part of a coordinated investigation led by
the narcotics team and briefed by constable angevine. his duties included
locating mr. mann, identifying any associated addresses, vehicles, or
individuals, and, if grounds were established, drafting a
criminal code
search warrant.

on march 16, o’connor began his shift at 2:00 p.m. and proceeded
to the area of 30 henry maracle street in ayr, ontario. this was one of the
known addresses linked to mr. mann. that evening, he personally observed mr.
mann at goodlife fitness in kitchener, exiting the facility and entering a grey
2011 bmw 5 series sedan bearing the personalized plate “6invader.” constable
o’connor assumed the vehicle’s driver-side door was damaged as both mr. mann
and another male entered via the passenger side.

mr. mann was carrying a blue duffel bag with a shoulder strap and
a water bottle affixed to it. o’connor described the bag as navy in colour and
approximately 24 inches in length, though he noted that his observations were
made from a distance.

following this, mr. mann was observed attending the residence at
30 henry maracle street, though o’connor did not personally witness mr. mann
entering the home. he was present at the location but relied on radio
communications from other officers for updates. his role at that time was to
maintain surveillance and, if grounds were established, act as the affiant for
the warrant.

on march 18, 2024, o’connor authored a
criminal code
search warrant, which was signed by justice of the peace michael perrault at
12:40 p.m. the warrant was not executed on march 19 due to mr. mann’s absence
from the residence.


on march 20, o’connor participated in the execution of the
warrant as a search officer. he entered the residence at 3:50 p.m., searched
the upper closet, basement, and the bmw parked outside, but found no (material)
property in any of those locations. his involvement concluded at 4:39 p.m.,
after interviewing one of the suspected residents, mandeep singh.

during cross-examination, o’connor adopted a suggestion by
defence counsel that that a cpic check conducted on march 17, 2024, showed the
bmw was registered to abhishek jain, not mr. mann. he conceded that the
registered owner of the vehicle based on the vin, was “jain abhishek”, born […],
1998.
b)
the evidence of constable elford

constable elford was a member of the specialized guns and drugs
unit and became involved in the investigation on march 15, 2024, following a
briefing regarding mr. mann’s suspected possession of a firearm. that evening,
elford deployed a covert “drop camera” outside the residence at 30 henry
maracle street. he explained that the camera was motion-triggered, faced a
public area, and was used to safely capture video evidence without intruding
into private spaces.

on march 16, 2024, elford participated in surveillance operations
from 1:51 p.m. to 7:52 p.m. at approximately 3:15 p.m., he observed a grey bmw
sedan pull into the driveway of the residence. a male exited the vehicle
carrying a duffel bag, followed by a female. the same female later returned to
the vehicle. elford identified the licence plate as “6invader.” these
observations were buttresses by photographic evidence entered as exhibits 5 and
6.

later that evening, at 7:47 p.m., elford observed mr. mann exit
the passenger side of the bmw, retrieve a blue duffel bag from the rear
driver-side door, and use a key to enter the residence.

he described the bag as blue, slightly larger than a backpack,
with a single strap and measuring 18 to 24 inches in length and 12 inches in
width. these observations were supported by similar photographic evidence
entered as exhibits 7, 8, and 9.

elford confirmed that mr. mann left the residence overnight on
march 18–19. he based this from his knowledge of the home’s monitoring via the drop
camera footage. as noted above, this absence would postpone the plan to execute
the warrant upon the residence and vehicle until march 20, 2024.

on march 20, 2024, elford was present during the execution of the
search warrant and was assigned to search the master bedroom. there, he located
a bmw ownership that listed the accused, mr. mann, as the registered owner of
the bmw and connected to another residence located at 32 fenton way in brampton,
ontario. these documents were entered as exhibits 10 and 11. the licence plate,
manufacturer (bmw), and model (550) listed in the ownership match that of the
vehicle mr. mann was driving at all relevant times of police observations.


i am aware that constable o’connor admitted under
cross-examination that cpic and other police checks noted another person, abhishek
jain as the registered owner of the bmw vehicle. i find the actual owner
immaterial to the relevant issues in this file. what is more important is the
personal documents of the accused in the residence located at 30 henry maracle.
whether the mto records show the bmw in another person’s name has no bearing on
the outcome of this case. it is also clear, as set out in greater detail below,
the accused mr. mann was operating the motor vehicle regardless of who the
registered owner may have been at the time.
c)
the evidence of constable beccario

constable beccario, also with the guns and gangs unit, was
assigned to search the kitchen area of the residence during the execution of
the search warrant on march 20, 2024. he located a blue gym bag on the kitchen
floor near the island. inside the bag, he found gym clothes, supplements, mr.
mann’s driver’s licence, and a black and silver handgun with a magazine seated
in the firearm.

the driver’s licence and firearm were found in separate internal compartments
of the bag.

beccario immediately notified the exhibits officer, detective
andrews, who photographed the items and proved the firearm safe. beccario
remained present during this process. the relevant photographs were entered as
exhibits 12 through 17, showing the bag
in situ, the firearm, the
driver’s licence, and the process of rendering the firearm safe.

photographs of this blue duffel bag and items found within it
were entered as exhibits 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. those photos may be
described in general terms as follows:
•
wide shot of the blue gym bag found in
the kitchen.
•
close-up of the gym bag.
•
the firearm
in situ
inside the
bag.
•
mr. mann’s driver’s licence found in a
separate compartment of the bag.
•
the firearm removed from the bag.
•
the firearm being proved safe, with the
magazine removed and placed on the tile floor.

beccario confirmed that he did not see anyone move the bag prior
to his search and did not observe any other individuals entering or exiting the
residence apart from tactical officers. he later attended 22 division to
interview mr. mann but had no further involvement in the investigation.

d)
the evidence of constable angevine

constable cole angevine was the officer in charge of the
investigation and coordinated both the surveillance and execution of the search
warrant. he has been a member of the peel regional police since august 2011 and
was the primary investigator in this matter.

the investigation commenced in march 2024 following information
received that mr. mann may be in possession of a firearm. angevine conducted
background checks, including cpic, mto, and local inquiries, which linked mr.
mann to the residence at 30 henry maracle street in ayr and a grey bmw sedan.
surveillance was initiated, and a covert drop camera was deployed on march 15,
2024, with angevine present during its installation.

on march 16, angevine conducted physical surveillance and
personally confirmed mr. mann’s identity at a goodlife fitness location in the
waterloo region. he identified mr. mann based on a neck tattoo and descriptors
provided in a briefing “run sheet.”

on march 19, the team attended the residence at approximately
5:20 a.m. intending to execute the search warrant but postponed it after
observing mr. mann and his vehicle had left earlier that day. surveillance
resumed the following morning, and angevine monitored the covert camera from
5:30 a.m. until 3:10 p.m., when the warrant was executed.

at 1:48 p.m., angevine observed mr. mann arrive at the residence
in a dark grey bmw, exit the driver’s side, and carry a dark blue gym bag with
two black handles into the home. a female occupant also exited the vehicle and
entered the residence with a separate bag. these observations were made via
live feed from the covert camera.

during the execution of the warrant at approximately 3:10 p.m.,
angevine remained outside until the scene was secured.

three individuals were detained:
(1)
the accused, mr. prabhjot mann
(2)
a female believed to be in a relationship with the accused; and,
(3)
an unknown male

had left the residence in a white dodge charger just prior to the waterloo
regional police services tactical team entering the residence to execute the
warrant.

no charges were laid against anyone other than the accused.

angevine was assigned to search several rooms, including bedrooms
and the garage, but did not seize any items personally. angevine was later
advised by andrews that a loaded glock 9mm handgun, nine rounds of ammunition,
a 16-round magazine, and mr. mann’s driver’s licence were found within the blue
gym bag located in the kitchen.

angevine confirmed that the bag where the firearm was located was
the same one, he saw mr. mann carrying earlier via the covert camera. he
expressed confidence that it was the same bag.

following the search, angevine was briefed on the seized property
and later advised constable beccario of the charges to be laid against mr.
mann.
e)
the officers’ evidence combined

i found each of the police witnesses to be credible and
forthright. their testimony was consistent with the physical and photographic
evidence, with no material contradictions exposed under cross-examination.

the only notable point of difference is an observation of constable
angevine that mr. mann exited the driver’s side door upon returning to
residence at 30 henry maracle st. on the date the warrant was executed. other officers
noted in their evidence that there was an observation that mr. mann had exited
via the passenger side door of the bmw on at least one prior occasion. this
point is immaterial to the relevant issues.

it may be the door did work, and he exited the passenger side on
another occasion for unknown reasons, perhaps the door was repaired in the
interim, or perhaps one of the officers’ is mistaken. it makes no meaningful difference
in my view the material issues to decide in this case.

minor discrepancies in peripheral observations, such as which
door mr. mann exited from, do not undermine the reliability of the core
evidence. these are expected variances in multi-officer surveillance and do not
detract from the overall credibility of the witnesses.

in conducting my analysis of the evidence, i am mindful that the
initial information received by police—suggesting mr. mann may be in possession
of a firearm—constitutes inadmissible hearsay. while no objection was raised
during trial, i have not relied on this information for any probative purpose
in determining whether mr. mann had knowledge and control over the firearm and
prohibited items.

the hearsay tendered at trial was limited to explaining the
narrative of events, and the state of mind of the officers. specifically, how
police attention was drawn to mr. mann and why officers undertook the
surveillance and investigative steps they did.
f)
the unchallenged identification of mr. mann

it is significant to point out that while not specifically
admitted in the asf, constables o’connor, beccario, elford, and angevine’s
observations relating to the identity of mr. mann were not challenged under
examination. despite this, i am cognizant that it is still the crown’s burden
to prove identification beyond a reasonable doubt. that burden exists
independent of any challenge or silence of the accused.

similarly, there was no meaningful challenge on any of the
officers’ observations on the blue duffel bag, or the conclusion drawn by
angevine that it was indeed the same bag the accused was seen carrying on march
16, or on march 20, 2024. i apply the same burden noted above on this material
point as well.

while the officers had no prior dealings with mr. mann prior to
the “tip” and commencement of the investigation, there was no equivocation on
who they were observing when referring to mr. mann, or any suggestion by
defence otherwise.

to the extent that officers did not see mr. mann, they were
forthright and admitted the occasions where updates were only being provided
through means of communication. regardless, there is still evidentiary value that
can be applied to that communication in ensuring that mr. mann remained the
person of targeted surveillance. put another way, while certain officers could
not make direct observations at certain locations, the information received
allowed them to confirm that the person being surveilled continued to match the
description and had related items (like the duffel bag) as observed by other
officers.

the only reasonable conclusion is that the accused, mr. prabhjot
mann, was consistently the subject of surveillance, as established through the
officers’ chain of observations. i accept their evidence to the extent that
they testified they could make those observations and identifying mr. mann.
this includes their observations regarding the duffel bag.

i am satisfied that the individual observed—whether through the
drop camera or through direct visual surveillance made by the officers—was the
accused, prabhjot mann. i have no doubt in this regard. the crown has met its
burden in that regard.

angevine’s identification of the blue duffel bag carried by mr.
mann—made via covert camera earlier that day—along with his observations at
goodlife fitness on march 16 and his confirmation that the bag matched the one
containing the firearm found during the search, provides a critical link in
establishing continuity and control over both mr. mann and the items in
question.

this is all combined with the admission that mr. mann was arrested
inside the residence at the time the firearm was found.
c.
the case for the defence

in response to the crown evidence, the defence
called the spouse of the accused amarjit kaur.
a)
the evidence of amarjit kaur

amarjit kaur, the wife of mr. mann, testified as
a defence witness. she stated that she and mr. mann were married in 2023 and
had been living together at 30 henry maracle street in ayr, ontario,
since march 2024. she described the residence as a leased home shared by
multiple individuals, including mr. mann, herself, and others such as mandeep
singh and abhishek jain.

ms. kaur testified that on march 18, 2024,
she accompanied mr. mann on a work-related trucking trip to quebec, returning
to the residence on march 20 between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m. she
stated that upon arrival, mandeep singh opened the door, and she and mr. mann
placed their bags in the kitchen before proceeding to their upstairs bedroom.
she described mr. mann as feeling unwell and stated that she gave him
medication before lying beside him while he slept.

regarding the blue duffel bag, ms. kaur
testified that it was primarily used by mr. mann for gym-related items,
including clothing, supplements, and ingredients for protein shakes. she stated
that she accessed the main compartment of the bag during the trip to prepare
shakes for mr. mann and denied ever seeing a firearm in the bag. she
acknowledged that mr. mann carried the blue bag into the kitchen upon their
return and placed it on the floor near the island.

during cross-examination, ms. kaur confirmed that the blue bag
was in mr. mann’s possession when they entered the residence and that he placed
it in the kitchen. she described its contents as including gym clothes,
sandals, deodorant, and shake ingredients, primarily stored in the main
compartment. she acknowledged using the bag during the trip but maintained that
she had no knowledge of any firearm being present.

ms. kaur also testified to interpersonal tensions within the
residence, particularly between mr. mann and abhishek jain. she described a
prior physical altercation between the two, which she had seen in a video
shared by mr. mann. according to her, the conflict stemmed from mr. mann’s
disapproval of mr. jain’s conduct toward another female resident, whom the
household considered a sister figure.

this altercation was captured on video and introduced as an
exhibit through ms. kaur. while the footage shows mr. mann physically
assaulting mr. jain, i have not engaged in any propensity reasoning that this
prior disreputable conduct makes him more or less likely to possess a firearm
or prohibited devices.

the relevance of this assault, led by the defence, is limited to
ms. kaur’s explanation of the animosity between mr. mann and mr. jain. it is
considered only as far as it may support the defence’s theory that mr. jain, or
someone close to him, coordinated and planted the firearm as an act of
retribution or to frame the accused.

ms. kaur expressed surprise upon learning from police that a firearm
had been found in the blue bag. she denied any knowledge of the weapon and
stated that she had never seen mr. mann possess one. she was briefly detained
during the execution of the search warrant but was released shortly thereafter.
b)
the assessment of amarjit kaur’s evidence

while ms. kaur’s testimony was not directly
contradicted under cross-examination, i found her lack of specificity on key
details relating to who was in possession of the blue bag at relevant times to
be evasive and an attempt to minimize the accused’s connection to it.

overall, i found her evidence as evasive,
incomplete, and implausible. a detailed assessment of why i came to this
conclusion is set out in greater detail below under the heading “the analysis
of the defence evidence and position”.
d.
the burden of proof, knowledge and control, and circumstantial evidence

to prove possession, the prosecution must prove knowledge of the
firearm and control over the firearm:
r. v. morelli,
2010 scc 8, 
1 s.c.r. 253, at paras.
15, 17;
r. v. lights,
2020 onca 128
at paras.
44-52;
r. v. choudhury,
2021 onca 560
at para.
19.

the case against the accused, as far as drawing conclusions of
knowledge and control, is based upon circumstantial evidence relating to where
the firearm was found, when, and its connection to the accused.

in assessing these circumstantial inferences, i am mindful of the
supreme court of canada’s ruling in
r. v. villaroman.

where the court held a trier of fact must not draw an inference of guilt unless
it is the only reasonable inference permitted by the evidence.

i have also instructed myself to look at the evidence
holistically to consider whether i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the only reasonable conclusion is one of guilt of the offence(s) based on the
totality of admissible and probative evidence.

a)
inference vs. speculation

as a matter of evidence, the difference between inference and
speculation is a key distinction.
mcwilliams' canadian criminal evidence,
5th edition § 31:17 states:
“the process of drawing inferences from evidence is not … the
same as speculating even where the circumstances permit an educated guess”. 4
conjecture and factual speculation cannot substitute for logical reasoning based
on evidence.5 “inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or
speculation”.6 “the dividing line between conjecture and inference is often a
very difficult one to draw”.7 a “reasonable possibility” may raise reasonable
doubt.8 so, too, it is not always easy to define, with any precision, “the
bright line distinction between the drawing of reasonable inferences and mere
speculation”

inference corresponds to a conclusion drawn inductively or
deductively from proven premises. speculation, by contrast, is a conclusion
offered without a sufficient evidentiary premise, or one that assumes facts not
in evidence. inference is premise-dependent reasoning; speculation is
premise-independent conjecture.

speculation lacks probative value and cannot be used to support
findings of fact by drawing inferences from them.


reasonable doubt may arise from competing inferences where the
premises are grounded in the record, but not from conjectures where the
premises are absent or unproven. while a trier of fact must consider other
explanations and plausible theories that are inconsistent with guilt, it does
not leave every theory advanced without a proper evidentiary foundation worthy
of raising reasonable doubt.

i am mindful that a lack of evidence may still raise doubt and
without speculation. a certain gap in the evidence may result in inferences
other than guilt. but those inferences must be reasonable given the evidence
and the absence of evidence, assessed logically, and considering human
experience and common sense.


reasonable doubt may arise from plausible alternative inferences,
but not from conjecture. this principle is echoed throughout in appellate
authority and well stated in in emphasizing that speculation lacks probative
value and cannot support a finding of fact.
b)
inferential and direct conclusions based upon the evidence

i therefore make the following findings of fact:
(1)
despite constable elford uncertainty at the time
the photos were captured at approximately 3:14 on march 16, 2024, it is now
clear by way of the nexus of evidence, that exhibits 5 and 6 is a photo of mr.
mann carrying a blue duffel bag. i also find this is the same duffel bag found
inside the residence on march 20 with the firearm and prohibited device inside.
(2)
the bmw seen in exhibit 7, is being driven by
prabjot mann at the time it is taken. immediately after in the sequence of
these photos, i find that the accused is the individual in exhibit 9 holding a
blue duffel bag. while exhibit 8 is blurry, the immediate sequencing of these
photos leads to conclude it is the accused as well.
(3)
the duffel bag with the loaded firearm found
inside, was the same bag officers o’connor and angevine saw the accused with on
march 16, 2024, inside the goodlife fitness (angevine), exiting the goodlife
(o’connor), and entering the residence located at 30 henry maracle on march 16,
2024.
(4)
that on march 20, 2024, via the covert camera
live feed and recordings, officer angevine observed mr. mann carrying the same
blue duffel bag he had on march 16, 2024, at the goodlife and entering the
residence at 30 henry maracle (as seen in exhibits 7, 8, and 9).
(5)
for greater clarity, i find the blue duffel bag
shown in exhibits 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15, is the same bag. i find this is the
same bag where the loaded firearm and prohibited device was found.
(6)
there is no “other” blue bag. while this was not
raised by the defence in argument, or through the evidence of ms. kaur, i kept
this possibility in mind as the evidence unfolded. ultimately, the evidence
confirmed that there was only one blue duffel bag connected to the residence or
to mr. mann. any other bag resembling the one mr. mann is observed carrying is
not based in the evidence, and is therefore speculative, and incapable of
supporting a logical inference to this end.

these direct and inferential conclusions noted
above are based upon the evidence presented at trial, and the agreed statement
of fact. those include:
(1)
observations of the officers noted above.
(2)
the temporal proximity to these observations of
the officers and mr. mann.
(3)
the size, shape, colour, and water bottle
affixed to the bag combined create a distinctive look of the bag.
(4)
the absence of evidence of any other bag and
combined water bottle resembling that seen by the officers.
(5)
the presence of mr. mann’s driver’s licence in
the same bag as the firearm—albeit in a separate compartment—supports the
inference that the bag was under his control. a driver’s licence is a personal
item typically kept close at hand, particularly when one is operating a motor
vehicle, as mr. mann was observed doing.
c)
the defence theory of evidence planting by a third
party

the defence’s theory is that the firearm was
planted by a resident in the home. i note at the outset that a third-party suspect
application was not filed to pursue who that specifically might be—although it
was theorized by the defence it might have been mr. singh, possibly at the
direction of mr. jain.

despite this, i am mindful of the ontario court
of appeal’s ruling in
r. v. appleton,
that makes it clear, at paragraphs 101-104 that a third-party suspect
theory is not an affirmative defence, nor does it shift any burden onto the
accused. rather, it is a denial that the crown has proven the essential element
of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. the theory is admissible to the extent
that it raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused was the person in
possession of the firearm and prohibited items.

importantly, the third-party suspect rule is a threshold inquiry
into admissibility. where relevant evidence exists suggesting that another
person may have committed the offence, that evidence may be considered in
evaluating whether the crown has met its burden. however, the rule must not be
misapplied in a manner that improperly shifts the burden of proof to the
accused. the ultimate question remains whether, on the totality of admissible
evidence, the crown has proven the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

therefore, and despite the lack of filing, i am
considering the defence in this respect noted above; however, for reasons noted
below, i reject it and it does not raise reasonable doubt towards the accused’s
guilt.
d)
the rejection of a third-party suspect
theory

the defence theory that someone else in the
residence planted the firearm in the blue duffel bag to frame mr. mann is
speculative, implausible, and unsupported by the evidentiary record.

based on police observations and covert camera
monitoring, the only individuals present in the residence from the time mr.
mann and his wife, amarjit kaur, returned from their trip to quebec until the
execution of the warrant were the two of them and mandeep singh. no other
occupants were found inside the home or observed coming and going during this
time. according to same observations, the individual with whom mr. mann had a
prior altercation—abhishek jain—was not present during any material times in
the investigation. his absence is also supported by the evidence of ms. kaur.

while mr. singh is described as a friend of mr.
jain, there is no evidence to suggest that he would have had the motive or
willingness to participate in a scheme to frame mr. mann. nor is there any
evidence that such a scheme ever existed or was threatened.

even assuming motive—which i do not find—the
theory fails as a matter of logic, reasonable inferences, and timed opportunity:
(1)
there is no evidence that mr. jain or mr. singh
knew when mr. mann and his wife would return home from their trip, nor that
they could have anticipated mr. mann would leave the blue bag unattended in the
kitchen while retiring to the bedroom.
(2)
surveillance footage shows mandeep singh leaving
the residence in a white dodge charger shortly before the tactical team arrived,
with no indication that he was aware of the impending execution of the warrant.
(3)
the warrant had already been issued and was
executed based on pre-existing surveillance, not any real-time tip or update.
(4)
there is no evidence that any tip was received between
mr. mann’s return home and the execution of the warrant; indeed, police were
themselves uncertain about when the warrant would be executed due to mr. mann’s
earlier absence, which had necessitated an unplanned postponement and
recalibration of the initial attempt.
(5)
the firearm was found inside an internal pocket of
the duffel bag. if the intent was to have police discover it upon immediate
examination, it makes little sense that it would be further concealed by
placing it within an internal pocket. this would also take more time to “plant”
and greater exposure while mr. mann and ms. kaur were in the home.
(6)
on the defence theory, the presence of mr.
mann’s driver’s licence inside the bag where the firearm was located would have
to be a fortuitous coincidence—either to mr. mann himself or to mr. jain’s
alleged scheme. this coincidence is highly implausible and contributes to my
overall reasons for rejecting the defence position.
(7)
if the initial “tip” somehow originated from
those responsible for planting the firearm, it would have predated the
accused’s unexpected trip to quebec. it is reasonable to assume that someone
providing such a tip would expect prompt police action. accordingly, any plan
to plant the firearm would likely have been coordinated with the expectation
that mr. mann would be searched shortly thereafter. if this were somehow the
case, it implies a firearm would be planted before the trip to quebec, in
alignment with the originally intended warrant execution date. since mr. mann
brought the blue duffel bag with him on that trip, it follows that—if the
firearm had been placed in the bag in anticipation of immediate police
action—he would have unknowingly carried it with him throughout his time in
quebec, despite frequent use of the bag by both him and his spouse.
(8)
despite an opportunity to do so when interviewed
on scene, there is no evidence to suggest mr. singh gave a statement to police incriminating
mr. mann by stating who the owner of the bag was. if the intent was to frame
mr. mann, it seems likely that the final step would be to incriminate him but
telling police that the blue duffel bag was mr. mann’s.

moreover, even if the firearm had been planted,
the theory lacks a coherent endgame.

it is illogical to assume that someone would
plant a loaded firearm in the bag of a person known to have previously inflicted
violence upon them or their friend, thereby risking further intimidation, violence,
or death. the idea that mr. jain or mr. singh would arm mr. mann—knowing his
capacity for violence—is inherently contradictory and implausible.
e)
the analysis of the defence evidence and position

ms. kaur’s testimony does not advance the
defence theory.

she was evasive on key details surrounding the
blue bag, particularly its contents and her awareness of the side pocket where
the firearm was found. her stated use of the bag was limited to accessing the
main compartment for vitamins and shake ingredients.

her reference to a “pink bag” was not put to any
officer in cross-examination and is immaterial, as she ultimately confirmed
that mr. mann carried the blue bag into the kitchen and placed it on the floor,
where it was later found.

while she testified that she believed someone
was cooking in the kitchen, she could not provide any details on who that was
or what they were doing. this evidence is of no assistance.

under cross-examination, ms. kaur acknowledged
that she only accessed the main compartment of the bag. this is significant as
the firearm was found in an internal side pocket as seen in exhibit 13. her
evidence therefore does not support a theory of “planting” as the “plant” would
not be in a location she would have seen and therefore could properly exclude
from her prior interactions with the bag.

the alternative, of course, is that she was
aware of the firearm and was not candid with the court. if i were required to
make a finding of fact one way or another, i would conclude she was aware of
the firearm and prohibited devices if one considers her access to the duffel
bag on the trip, and her relationship with her husband.

she further admitted under cross-examination
that the accused would typically use the blue bag to attend the gym. he would
attend 4-5 times a week for 1 to 1.5 hours at a time. this establishes strong
evidence that mr. mann had primary, if not exclusive, use of the blue bag where
the firearm was found. it makes little sense that mr. mann would consistently switch
bags considering the frequency in which he visited the gym. regardless, he was
using it and seen with it at the relevant times.

taken together, the defence theory is
speculative, internally inconsistent, implausible, illogical, and contradicted
by the surveillance, witness testimony, and physical exhibits. i reject it
entirely.
e.
application of the law of constructive possession

while this case is one of possession
simpliciter,
namely mr. mann’s knowledge and control of the firearm and prohibited devices,
i also put my mind to the doctrine of constructive possession since the bag was
found inside his residence, while he was found in different room in the home.

i am mindful in reaching any conclusions that
tenancy or occupancy of a place where contraband is found does not create a
“presumption of possession.”

the test for possession was repeated by the
ontario court of appeal in the case of
r. v. choudhury

as follows:
•
constructive possession is established
when an accused does not have physical custody of an object but knowingly has
it in the actual possession or custody of another person or has it in any place
for their own or another’s use or benefit:
criminal code, s. 4(3)(a);
r.
v. morelli,
2010 scc 8,
 1 s.c.r. 253, at para.
17; and
r.
v. lights,
2020 onca 128,
149 o.r. (3d) 273, at para.
47.
•
knowledge
and control
are essential elements of
constructive possession, which is established when the crown proves beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused: (i) has knowledge of the character of the
object said to be possessed; (ii) knowingly puts or keeps the object in a
particular place, whether or not the place belongs to or is occupied by the accused;
and (iii) intends to have the object in the place for the use or benefit of the
accused or another person:
morelli, at paras.
15, 17;
lights,
at paras.
44, 47.
•
tenancy or occupancy of a place
where an object is found does not create a presumption of possession:
lights,
at para.
50;
r. v. watson,
2011 onca 437,
at para.
13;
r. v. lincoln,
2012 onca
542, at paras.
2-3; and
r. v. bertucci
(2002),
2002 canlii 41779 (on ca),
169 c.c.c. (3d) 453
(ont. c.a.), at para.
18.
•
when the crown relies largely or wholly
on circumstantial evidence to establish constructive possession,
a conviction
can be sustained only if the accused’s knowledge and control of the impugned
objects is the only reasonable inference on the facts. the trier of fact must
determine whether any other proposed way of looking at the case as a whole is
reasonable enough to raise a doubt about the accused’s guilt, when assessed
logically and in light of human experience and common sense:
see
r.
v. villaroman,
2016 scc 33,
 1 s.c.r. 1000, at paras.
55-56;
lights,
at para.
39; and
r. v. stennett,
2021 onca
258, at paras.
60-61.

on the topic of constructive possession, i have
also reviewed the case of
r. v. yousuf,,
its application of
r. v. morelli,
and applied it strictly in my analysis of these facts before me.
f.
findings of fact supporting possession

i conclude that both tests for actual and constructive possession
are met in this case. the facts i have found, and rely upon are as follows in
drawing the inferences that the accused had control and knowledge of the firearm
and prohibited items are as follows:
•
the blue duffel bag where the firearm and prohibited device was
located contained the driver’s licence of the accused, prabhjot mann.
•
the driver’s licence was found near the firearm, albeit in a
separate pocket.
•
as a matter of common sense, a driver’s licence is personal item
that is kept in proximity and control of by an active operator of a motor
vehicle, as mr. mann was.
•
mr. mann is a professional driver and not having his licence with
him for a commercial trip to quebec is highly implausible.
•
the accused was observed carrying the blue duffel bag into the
residence on march 20, 2024, shortly before the firearm was discovered within
it.
•
the same bag was observed in his possession on march 16, 2024,
during surveillance at goodlife fitness and at the residence.
•
the bag contained mr. mann’s driver’s licence, a personal item
typically kept on-hand, found in a separate compartment from the firearm.
•
the firearm was in a side pocket, not the main compartment, which
ms. kaur testified she accessed—supporting the inference that mr. mann had
exclusive control over the firearm’s location.
•
the accused was the primary user of the bag, as confirmed by ms.
kaur, who stated he used it regularly for gym visits (4–5 times per week).
•
no other individual was observed handling the bag between the
time of mr. mann’s arrival and the execution of the warrant.
•
the firearm was loaded, suggesting it was prepared for use, not abandoned,
or discarded.
•
the defence theory of planting is speculative and unsupported by
any direct or circumstantial evidence.
•
the accused’s conduct—placing the bag in the kitchen and retiring
to the bedroom—suggests knowledge and control, not abandonment or ignorance.

i find as a fact that mr. mann had both direct
knowledge and control of the firearm and the prohibited items in the blue duffel
bag.

there is no evidence anyone was using it at the
time, that anyone else had an invitation to use it, or that he did not exercise
ultimate control over the blue duffel bags at all material times. i find the
evidence supports the inference that mr. mann knew the contents of the bag. the
issue of “constructive” possession therefore becomes redundant.

however, if my reasoning is wrong in this
respect, i further find in the alternative the firearm, ammunition, and
extended capacity were deposited in the bag by him with an intent to have the
object for his use or benefit on a later occasion and therefore meeting the
test of constructive possession as well.
g.
conclusion

the only reasonable conclusion to be reached is that this was the
accused’s duffel bag, his firearm, his ammunition, and his prohibited magazine
housing the ammunition. he had both knowledge and control over these items.
there is no evidence of passive acquiescence, nor is there any reasonable
inference on the evidence before me, and the facts i have found noted above,
that these items were placed (or “planted”) by someone else.

despite the issue being undisputed at trial, for the sake of
completion of the record, i find that the manner the firearm was stored
(loaded, without a trigger lock, in an unsecured duffel bag, on a kitchen
floor, with other occupants in the home) was “careless” as defined by 86(1) of
the
criminal code.

for the reasons set out above, i find mr. mann guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt on all counts before the court on information 998 24 31103237.
released: september 4, 2025
justice
s. robichaud

see exhibit 1 to the proceedings “agreed statement of facts”

it was later discovered through the evidence of ms. kaur, the
accused’s spouse, that she and mr. mann had gone to quebec on a work-related
trip during their absence.

presumably it is the same year (2011) and vin, but evidence was not
led specifically on that point.

no statement was led by the crown and therefore has no bearing on
this decision.
