overview

the accused, derek burgess, is on trial for
allegedly assaulting his girlfriend’s young son.

he faces four charges: one count of assault by choking and three counts of
common assault. it is alleged that the accused picked the complainant up by his
neck, threw him onto a bed, and forced his head into a pillow. the other counts
arise from allegations that the accused slapped the complainant on the back,
face, and legs on separate occasions, and kicked his leg one time. the only
issue for me to decide is whether the crown has proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused intentionally committed the acts described by the
complainant.

these reasons explain why the crown has met its
burden on all counts.
legal principles

the crown bears the onus of proving each and
every element of the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt. the accused
carries no onus to prove or disprove anything. he is presumed innocent of all
charges. the burden of proof never shifts to the accused. it is not enough for
me to believe that the accused is probably or likely guilty of an offence. in
that situation, i would need to acquit. while the crown is not required to
prove its case to an absolute certainty, proof beyond a reasonable doubt falls
much closer to an absolute certainty than the balance of probabilities. it is
an exacting standard unique to the criminal process. reasonable doubt can arise
from the evidence or from the absence of evidence. furthermore, the crown must
prove each charge independently. the facts only relevant to one charge do not
assist in proving the other.

the accused did not testify in this case. i draw
no adverse inference from this decision. there is nevertheless exculpatory
evidence before me, and therefore the
w.(d.)
principles apply. the
defence called the complainant’s mother. she testified that the accused never
assaulted her son. on the complainant’s account, she would have been present
for at least some of the alleged assaults. she also would have been around to potentially
see any resulting injuries. i must acquit if i accept the mother’s evidence that
the assaults did not occur or if her evidence leaves me in doubt. the overriding consideration is whether the full evidentiary record leaves
me with any reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt: see
r. v. thomas,
2012 onsc 6653
at para.
24. any evidence favourable to the accused must be
considered with the conflicting evidence as a whole. the
w.(d).
analysis
ensures that my verdict is not based on a choice between the crown evidence and
the defence evidence: see
r. v. a.j.k.,
2022 onca 487
at para.
22.

the complainant is a child. his statement to the
police was admitted into evidence on consent pursuant to
s. 715.1
of the
criminal
code. he was 10 years old when he gave his statement and 11 years old when
he testified in court. i must assess his evidence with reference to criteria
appropriate to his mental development, understanding, and ability to
communicate. the complainant’s youth was evident during the statement. at one
point, the police officer taking his statement stepped out of the room; upon
returning, she found the complainant hiding underneath the couch. i must take a
“common sense approach” when assessing the testimony of children and not impose
“the same exacting standard” on a child as i might on an adult:
r. v. b.(g.),
1990 canlii 7308 (scc), 2 s.c.r. 30 at 54-55;
r. v. w.(r.),
1992 canlii 56 (scc), 2 s.c.r. 122 at
133-134. “while children may not be able to recount precise details and
communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean
that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it”:
b.(g.)
at 54-55; see also
r. v. d.f.,
2023 onca 584
at paras.
63-69.

to be certain, the standard of
proof is not lower in cases that rely on a child witness. guarding against the
injustice of a wrongful conviction demands a robust evidentiary foundation
before returning a guilty verdict.
analysis of the defence evidence

the complainant’s mother testified that the
accused was her former partner and that he lived with her approximately 70–80%
of the time during the relevant months when her son was in her care. she
described herself as a protective mother and denied ever witnessing the accused
assault the complainant. she stated that she would never permit anyone to harm
her child and insisted that the accused treated the complainant well, often
playing with him and assisting with discipline. she testified that she never
observed bruising or redness on the complainant during her parenting time. she asserted
that the allegations of abuse were fabricated with pressure from the
complainant’s father amid a contentious custody dispute.

i do not accept the testimony of the
complainant’s mother. i find that she was not a credible or reliable witness on
the material issue of whether the accused abused the complainant.

there was a significant inconsistency in the
mother’s evidence concerning her relationship with her son. during her
examination in-chief, she portrayed them as a close team who did everything
together and described him as “just a good all-around kid”. she described their
relationship much less optimistically when speaking to the police. she
acknowledged that her son slapped her, raised his fists at her, and even
treated her “like garbage”. the inconsistency is stark. i find that she tried
to suppress this negative characterization of their relationship during her
examination in-chief.

this inconsistency matters because it informs
how she might have perceived the accused’s conduct toward her son. the evidence
revealed that she greatly valued the accused’s presence in the home because he
supported her in managing her son’s behaviour. she acknowledged that her son’s
conduct improved after the accused entered the home and that she was relieved
to finally have someone on her side. while this does not necessarily mean that
she deliberately ignored abuse, it undermines the reliability of her assertion
that no abuse occurred. she could have seen what she wanted to see by focusing
on the help the accused was providing to regulate her son. she may have
minimized or rationalized physical aggression as legitimate discipline. for
example, she emphasized verbal interventions such as “go to your room and
listen to your mother” yet conceded that the accused physically carried the
complainant to his bedroom when he refused to comply. this selective framing
suggests a willingness to downplay conduct that crossed the line from
discipline to violence. that finding is not inconsistent with the evidence that
she loved her son. affection and vigilance are not synonymous; a parent can
care deeply yet still minimize or rationalize conduct that crosses the line.

i also found it concerning that the mother was
testifying because she needed to clear her name. she explained that she was
testifying “to stand up for myself, to defend myself and, and to let everyone
know that i would never, i would never allow anyone to touch my son”. yet the
mother was not the one on trial. her comment suggested a personal motivation
that may have influenced the reliability of her testimony and calls into
question whether she was committed to sharing her genuine recollection of
events.

even if i accepted the mother’s testimony, it
would not preclude a guilty verdict on some counts. on the record before me, it
remains plausible that the accused could have committed some of the alleged assaults
without the mother noticing. but i need not resolve that hypothetical. given
the flaws i have identified, her testimony does not leave me in doubt about
whether the offences occurred or could have occurred.
analysis of the crown’s case

the defence argues that the complainant’s
evidence lacked reliability and credibility on account of inconsistencies. the
defence argues further that the complainant intentionally coloured his evidence,
was impeached on fundamental elements of the allegations, and made bald
assertions without sufficient detail.

i disagree. i accept the complainant’s evidence.
i find that he was credible witness who gave reliable evidence about being
assaulted by the accused.
inconsistencies
in describing the assaults

the defence focused during cross-examination and
in its written submissions on purported inconsistencies in how the complainant
recounted the choking incident. in his police statement, the complainant stated
that he was having trouble sitting down during dinner. the accused responded by
grabbing him by the neck with both hands, lifting him off the ground, and
carrying him from the kitchen to his bedroom. the accused then threw him onto
the bed, pressed his head into a pillow, and continued choking him for about
ten seconds, making it difficult to breathe. the complainant recalled crying
during the incident and said his mother was present but did nothing.

the defence suggested that the complainant’s
account—even within his police statement—was internally inconsistent and
inherently implausible.

i see no such flaw. even if the complainant were an adult, it would be
unrealistic to expect flawless narration from the person involved in a dynamic
and apparently traumatic event. human memory does not operate like a video
recording.

the defence emphasized that the complainant
walked back the choking allegations during his testimony.

i reproduce the passage in
question:
q. so i’m going to
suggest that you’re actually telling a story that’s not really, it’s not really
matching up with, with one another, okay? that you had described being thrown
and placed on the bed in multiple ways, okay? i’m going to suggest to you that
the way you’re describing this, they, they can’t all be true, okay? and really
what i’m suggesting [to you], is that [the accused] never threw you on the bed.
at, at no point in time did [the accused] actually throw you onto the bed?
isn’t that right?
a. kind of.

contrary to counsel’s argument, the
complainant’s answer was not devastating to his credibility or reliability. his
“kind of” response must be examined in context. it followed a lengthy question
with multiple parts. the subsequent testimony established that the complainant
was not resiling from his description of the choking incident:
q. i, i am
suggesting to you that, in fact, [the accused] never threw you on the bed? that he’s never thrown you on the bed
and i believe that you answered my question by saying “maybe”? is that right?
a. no.
…
q. i’m going to suggest that you used your
own two feet to walk to your room and eat that night?
a. no.
…
q. i’m suggesting even further that he
never grabbed your neck like you’ve described and pushed it into the pillow,
okay? i’m, i’m going to suggest to you, would you agree that he didn’t do that?
a. no.
…
q. i’m going to suggest you, you actually
don’t recall and you don’t have the memory of [the accused] throwing you on the
bed, or of [the accused] picking you up and choking you? would you agree with
that?
a. no.

the complainant’s greater difficulty in recounting
events at trial as compared to his police statement does not undermine my
assessment of his credibility or reliability. his answers were not so limited such
that cross-examination was illusory, and he provided additional detail on the
second day of trial when testifying by cctv. it is unsurprising that his police
statement was more comprehensive. one rationale for admitting such statements
under
s. 715.1
is that they are given closer in time to the events and in
circumstances more conducive to disclosing difficult details.

a notable example of added detail at trial
concerned the accused pushing the complainant’s head into a pillow.

in his police statement, the
complainant imprecisely demonstrated the accused’s motions and did not say
exactly where the accused placed his hands. at trial, defence counsel suggested
that the accused’s hands were on the back of the complainant’s head. the
complainant firmly but fairly disagreed, explaining: “i don’t think, i don’t
think it was the back of my head … he lifted my head up and then put me on my
pillow, like, like with the side of my head”.

the precise location of the accused’s hands is not material, but the
complainant’s approach—reflecting on what he remembered and candidly qualifying
his answer—showed maturity and a genuine effort to be accurate. i found the
complainant’s testimony on this issue to be compelling. it enhanced his overall
credibility and reliability.

finally, the defence points to crown counsel’s
question in re-examination—“do you remember talking about the incident where
you were slapped in the face about five times?”—and the complainant’s equivocal
answer, “kind of”. the difficulty is that the complainant never alleged five
face slaps in a single incident. that detail only appears in his police statement
in relation to slaps on his legs while playing video games. however, the
misstatement originated in the phrasing of the crown’s question, not in the
complainant’s evidence. his response was ambiguous and does not amount to an
adoption of that statement. if anything, his response reflects an attempt to
reconcile the accurate and inaccurate components of the question. the
complainant’s core account remained consistent: two face-slapping incidents and
one leg-slapping incident.
ability to hide in the closet

the complainant gave conflicting accounts about
whether he could fit in the closet at his mother’s apartment. in his police
statement, he said that he did not hide in the closet because it was too small.
during cross-examination, he admitted that he could fit in the closet if he
wanted to.

i must carefully consider whether this inconsistency
demonstrates a flagrant or careless disregard for the truth that undermines the
complainant’s overall credibility. i find that it does not. the inconsistency
relates to a peripheral matter. the complainant never linked the closet’s small
size to an inability to hide from the accused and thereby avoid the alleged
assaults. he testified that some of the assaults caught him by surprise. and
for those where the complainant did hear the accused yelling in advance, it is
unclear how hiding in the closet would have helped him. the defence submits
that the complainant fabricated the idea of trying to hide during his police
statement to fill a gap in his account. i do not accept that submission. the
complainant’s reference to hiding was brief, undeveloped, and did not appear to
be an effort to repair a deficiency. in short, the closet was not presented as relevant
to the narrative of abuse. i do not know why the complainant told the police
one thing and the court another, but i am satisfied that the complainant was not
attempting to deceive the officer. this issue does not affect my overall assessment
of the complainant’s credibility on the material points.
relationship with the
accused

i find the complainant’s relationship with the
accused—beyond the alleged assaults—to be immaterial. the defence elicited
evidence of when the complainant appeared to enjoy the accused’s company and
confided in him. the implicit logic is that such trust and apparent happiness
are incompatible with the alleged assaults. i do not agree with that reasoning.
i do not know whether the complainant’s happiness was genuine during those
moments. even if it were, it is not inconsistent to maintain closeness with
someone who is also causing harm. a video clip of the complainant smiling and
laughing is not a reliable barometer of what happened in the home.
presence and absence of injuries

the evidence establishes that the complainant
sustained a bruise to his leg during the relevant period. i accept the evidence
of the complainant and his father on this issue. in his police statement, the
complainant said that the accused kicked him on the right leg while he was
sitting on the side of his bed. he described the kick as leaving a red mark
immediately, which turned purple a few days later. he rated the force as “maybe
like a six or a five” out of ten compared to a soccer kick. at trial, he confirmed
that the kick was to his thigh while his feet were on the ground and his legs
bent at a 90-degree angle, though he could not describe precisely how the foot
made contact. the complainant’s father testified that in mid to late february
2024, the complainant showed him a “fairly good-sized” bruise on his leg—he
believed the left leg but was uncertain.


the bruise lends some support of the
complainant’s account, though i do not put too much weight on it. the
complainant was an active young boy who played soccer regularly, making it
possible that the bruise resulted from a cause unrelated to the accused.
despite this caution, the size, colour, and timing of the bruise are broadly
consistent with his description of being kicked by the accused. i find that the
bruise gives me a measure of added confidence in the credibility and
reliability of the complainant’s evidence: see
r. v. h.p.,
2022 onca 419
at para.
71.

the absence of other significant injuries does
not diminish the credibility or reliability of the complainant’s account. he
testified that he noticed some redness on his face after being slapped but
observed no marks or bruising elsewhere, including after the choking incident. i
do not accept the submission that common sense dictates he would have suffered
visible injuries.

the assaults he described are not of a kind that would necessarily leave lasting
or obvious marks, even if the slaps to the face were delivered sharply and with
enough force to make an audible sound. nor can i say that the choking described
ought to have resulted in bruising. the fact that other people, such as his
father, school staff, or members of the public, did not notice or react to any
redness is immaterial. these were relatively minor effects, and i would not
expect them to draw attention. accordingly, the lack of observable injuries
does not introduce doubt about whether the assaults occurred.

finally, the fact that the complainant’s mother did
not see any injuries does not impact my assessment. i have already explained why
i do not accept her testimony and that it does not leave me in doubt.
motive to fabricate

the defence submits that the allegations were
fabricated for strategic reasons connected to family dynamics. counsel argues
that the complainant’s father had a strong incentive to secure full custody and
viewed allegations of abuse as a “sure-fire way” to achieve that goal.

the father allegedly coached the
complainant or influenced him by portraying the accused as dangerous and
unsuitable for his mother. the defence also contends that the complainant
himself had motives: he disliked the accused’s paternal role in enforcing
rules, did not want his mother to continue her relationship with the accused,
and preferred living full-time with his father. the complainant acknowledged
that reporting abuse could lead to his mother and the accused separating. the
defence submits that these factors, taken together, provided a plausible motive
for fabrication.

i accept that the father bore animus toward the
mother and wanted to change the parenting regime in his favour. he gratuitously
called the mother a “narcissist”—this characterization was untethered to any
factual foundation in the evidence. he acknowledged exploring a shift to full
custody months before the allegations surfaced, and he was the one who brought the
complainant to the police.

in my view, however, the record does not show that
the father’s animus translated into coaching or contamination of the
complainant’s core allegations. the father testified that he learned details
only after the complainant had already disclosed incidents to a cas worker.
that sequence—disclosure to child protection first, then to the
parent—undercuts a theory that the account originated from or was scripted by
the father. the police interview occurred away from the father and was
conducted by an officer using open
‑
ended prompts to draw out
the complainant’s allegations. the discrepancy between the complainant and his
father as to which leg bore the bruise also weakens the coaching theory. the
father’s evidence on this point did not carry the hallmarks of collusion; it
was hesitant and almost casual, not the kind of account one would expect from a
story crafted for his son to repeat:
so he showed me his leg. i think it was his
left leg, i’m not 100 percent sure on it. i mean, the details are a little bit
fuzzy and if i had known something was going on at that point, i’m sure i would
have made more of a mental note …

the complainant’s evidence reflects the
characteristics of an uncoached, child
‑
centred account. his
statement included mundane detail (e.g., his gaming habits) and candid
admissions of not remembering peripheral matters. he did not immediately
volunteer allegations against the accused; rather, the officer had to elicit
them gradually. when allegations emerged, he qualified suggestions and
offered measured responses.

these features, coupled with the absence of sweeping accusations, are
inconsistent with a rehearsed narrative and instead reflect the uneven recall
typical of a child witness. when he testified months later, he adopted his
statement but remained cautious on points he could not recall, reinforcing my
impression of his sincerity.

while the lack of embellishment is not a
makeweight in favour of credibility, it is a relevant factor when assessing a
claimed motive to fabricate:
r. v. gerrard,
2022 scc 13
at para.
5.

the complainant did not overstate
his injuries. he agreed there were no bruises on his face and no marks on his
neck from the choking incident; he spoke only of transient redness. he
described a single kick to the leg that left a bruise and rated the force as
moderate, not maximal. this restraint, particularly from a young complainant, militates
against an account fabricated to serve ulterior objectives.

the complainant may have wished for his mother
and the accused to separate. that possibility is neither surprising nor
sinister in the context of a blended family. what matters is why he held that view. on re
‑
examination,
when asked why he did not want his mother dating the accused, the complainant’s
answer was unqualified: “because what he did to me.” that response was anchored
in the alleged conduct, not in a desire for more time with his father or a general
dislike of the accused. i accept that evidence. it was credible.

in conclusion, i do not find that the
complainant acted on any motive to fabricate. i am not,
however, making a positive finding that he had no motive to fabricate. motives
can remain hidden or there may be no motive at all:
r. v. bartholomew,
2019
onca 377
at para.
22. there is no burden on the accused to prove a
motive to fabricate or to disprove that the complainant had no motive to
fabricate:
r. v. s.s.s.,
2021 onca 552
at para.
38. i
do not use the absence of motive to fabricate as a makeweight in favour of the
complainant’s credibility; see also
r. v. r.k.,
2023 onca
653
at para.
46.
credibility
findings

in summary, i find the complainant to be a
credible witness who gave reliable evidence about the assaults. while his
account was not always rich in detail, the level of specificity he provided was
proportionate to his age and developmental stage. the complainant is a young
boy of few words, but i do not require a tapestry of detail to be satisfied
that these events occurred. the complainant’s candour, which included his
willingness to acknowledge what he could not remember, enhanced his credibility:
see
r. v. cordeiro,
2024 onca 868
at para.
14. his inability to
recall certain details does not prevent me from accepting the core of his
testimony: see
r. v. a.a.,
2023 onca 174
at para.
17. on the essential
points, the complainant adhered to the account he gave in his police statement
and was not materially dislodged in cross
‑
examination.
having considered both the individual and cumulative effect of the defence
challenges, i am satisfied that they do not undermine his credibility or
reliability.
conclusions

i accept the complainant’s evidence. having
considered the entire evidentiary record, including the exculpatory evidence
from the complainant’s mother and the absence of other injuries, i am not left
with reasonable doubt. rather, i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused committed the assaults in the manner described by the complainant.

the defence acknowledges that this conclusion
ends the analysis. having accepted the complainant’s evidence, there is no
dispute that the crown has proven the physical and mental elements of each
offence beyond a reasonable doubt. there is no suggestion that the accused
acted unintentionally or with consent. these were not instances of playfighting
or legitimate discipline. they were assaults, committed in anger or under the
guise of misguided discipline, typically because the complainant was not
listening or complying.

on count 1, assault by choking, suffocation, or
strangulation, i find that the accused choked the complainant when he grabbed
him by the neck with both hands during dinner and continued to suffocate him when
he pressed his head into the pillow. the complainant had difficulty breathing
for about 10 seconds.

the three counts of common assault are unparticularized.
i attribute the conduct as follows on the consent of the parties:

•
on count 2, i find that the accused kicked the
complainant on the leg with sufficient force to leave a bruise.
•
on count 3, i find that the accused slapped the
complainant on his face and legs over three incidents. there were two incidents
where the accused slapped the complainant in the face with an open hand. in the
context of one incident, the face slapping followed the accused saying, “why
are you not listening to me, do what i told you?”
•
on count 4, i find that the accused entered the
complainant’s room, took off his headphones, struck or slapped him on the back,
and told him it was time to leave. while this assault was relatively minor, it
nevertheless involved the application of force without consent.

i find the accused guilty on all counts.
