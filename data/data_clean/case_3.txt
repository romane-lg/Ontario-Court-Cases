defendant harinder khosa
robichaud j.:

the applicant, harinder khosa, is charged with
impaired operation, contrary to
s. 320.14(1)
of the
criminal code;
dangerous operation, contrary to s. 320.13(1); flight from a peace officer,
contrary to s. 320.17; and fail or refuse to comply with a demand, contrary to
s. 320.15(1).

before the commencement of oral submissions on
this application, i confirmed with counsel and the accused that all parties are
prepared to proceed on january 19, 2026. i confirmed: no further
charter
applications are anticipated other than those already filed; the accused, who
resides in alberta, will attend in person if this application is dismissed;
defence counsel is retained and ready to proceed; and the crown confirms that
the material witnesses have been subpoenaed or are expected to attend.

subject to this motion, the parties jointly
indicate that the trial is ready to commence, neither party anticipates seeking
any further adjournment.

the applicant seeks a stay of proceedings under
s. 24(1) of the
charter
of rights and freedoms
based on an
alleged breach of s. 11(b). the information was sworn on february 21, 2023. the
trial is scheduled to commence on january 19, 2026, and conclude on january 21.

the parties filed transcripts and scheduling
materials. the total period is 1063 days, approximately 35 months. the record
establishes periods of delay waived by the defence and delay caused by the
defence.

after accounting for institutional delay,
deducting defence‑caused delay, waiver as set out below, apportioned
delay, the net delay is 307 days (approximately 10.1 months), which well below
the 18‑month presumptive ceiling for trials in the ontario court of
justice.

the application is dismissed.

applicable
law

timely justice is a cornerstone of a fair and
democratic society.
section 11(b)
of the
canadian charter of rights and
freedoms
guarantees every accused person the right to be tried within a
reasonable time. this right protects not only the liberty and security of the
accused, but also the integrity of the justice system itself. when trials are
delayed, accused persons remain in legal limbo, victims are left without
closure, and public confidence in the courts is eroded.

as the supreme court emphasized in
r. v.
jordan,
excessive delay has become a systemic issue, often tolerated through outdated
practices and institutional inefficiencies.

the framework established in
jordan, and
reaffirmed in
r. v. cody,
requires all participants in the justice system to take proactive steps to
prevent delay and ensure that criminal proceedings are conducted fairly,
efficiently, and within constitutionally acceptable timelines.

the
jordan
analysis was simplified by the
ontario court of appeal in
r v. coulter,

as follows:
(1)
calculate the
total delay, which is
the period from the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial (
jordan, at para.
47
).
(2)
subtract
defence delay
from
the total delay, which results in the "
net delay
"
(
jordan, at para.
66
)
(3)
compare the net delay to the presumptive ceiling (
jordan, at para.
66
).
(4)
if the net delay exceeds the presumptive ceiling, it is
presumptively unreasonable. to rebut the presumption, the crown must establish
the presence of
exceptional circumstances
(
jordan,
para.
47
). if it cannot rebut the presumption, a stay will follow (
jordan, para.
47
). in general, exceptional circumstances
fall under two categories:
discrete events
and
particularly complex
cases
(
jordan,
para.
71
).
(5)
subtract delay caused by discrete events from the net delay
(leaving the "
remaining delay
") for the purpose of
determining whether the presumptive ceiling has been reached (
jordan,
para.
75
).
(6)
if the remaining delay exceeds the presumptive ceiling, the court
must consider whether the case was particularly complex such that the time the
case has taken is justified and the delay is reasonable (
jordan,
at para.
80
).
(7)
if the
remaining delay falls below the
presumptive ceiling, the onus is on the defence to show that the
delay is unreasonable (
jordan, para.
48
).

in addition to this framework, i am mindful
that: i) the “presumptive ceiling” for provincial courts, as is the case here,
is 18 months; ii) a stay of proceedings “below the ceiling” are rare and
require proof of meaningful defence efforts and unreasonable delay.; iii) in setting
the “ceilings”, the supreme court factored in tolerance for reasonable
institutional delay.


to the extent the defence invokes
askov
and
morin
in their materials to frame calculation or prejudice, those
authorities have been superseded by jordan for the purpose of delay assessment.
a stay “below the ceiling” is reserved for the clearest of cases and requires
meaningful defence steps and delay markedly exceeding what was reasonably
required.
iii.
methodology and calculation framework

as noted, the
total delay to the commencement of trial in this
matter is
1063 days: approximately
35 months. this delay is well above the presumptive ceiling set out in
jordan.

there are no discrete events.

the case is not complex.
iv.
defence
‑
attributed
delay and waiver

the defence submits that 364 days should be deducted as defence‑caused
delay, yielding a net of approximately 21 months. i reject this calculation.
the interval they identify from march 6 to december 18, 2024, is 287 days, not
364. more broadly, the defence chart in appendix a contains cumulative figures
that do not reconcile with the record. my deductions and the net delay are
based on verified intervals and are set out in these reasons.

quoting directly from the relevant passage in the supreme court’s
decision in
r. v. jordan:
 defence delay has two
components. the first is delay waived by the defence. […] waiver can be
explicit or im
plicit, but
in either case, it must be clear and
unequivocal. the accused must have full knowledge of his or her rights, as well
as the effect waiver will have on those rights. […] [i]t must be remembered
that it is not the right itself, which is being waived, but merely the
inclusion of specific periods in the overall assessment of reasonableness” […]
[…]
 the
second component of defence delay is delay caused solely by the conduct of the
defence.
this kind of defence delay comprises “those situations where the accused’s
acts either directly caused the delay... or the acts of the
accused are shown to be a deliberate and calculated tactic employed to delay
the trial”
(
askov, at pp. 1227-28). deliberate and calculated
defence tactics aimed at causing delay, which include frivolous applications
and requests, are the most straightforward examples of defence delay. trial
judges should generally dismiss such applications and requests the moment it
becomes apparent they are frivolous.

as another example, the defence will have
directly caused the delay if the court and the crown are ready to proceed, but
the defence is not. the period of delay resulting from that unavailability will
be attributed to the defence. however, periods of time during which the court
and the crown are unavailable will not constitute defence delay, even if
defence counsel is also unavailable. […]

[emphasis added]

the supreme court makes clear that delay “waived
by the defence” and delay “caused solely by the conduct of the defence” must be
deducted, including where the defence is not ready when the crown and the court
are ready, or where defence actions are illegitimate and not taken to respond
to the charges.
a.
delay was a deliberate and calculated tactic employed to delay the
trial

on the totality of the record, i find this is
one of the rare matters contemplated in
jordan
mentioned in the cited
paragraphs above in which defence conduct amounted to a
deliberate and
calculated tactic
to delay the trial.

in
r v cody, the court stated defence
conduct may be deemed not legitimate if it exhibits marked inefficiency or
marked indifference toward delay.

in
r v j.f., the court underscores the obligation to raise delay
concerns in a timely, proactive way so proactive measures can be taken to
remedy any delay.


applied here, the persistent pursuit of
adjournments to advance “global resolution” long after the crown’s firm
february 16, 2024 position, the sequence of express
s. 11
(b) waivers through
late 2024, the failure to flag
s. 11
(b) when trial dates were set on january
30, 2025 and put on the record on february 12, 2025, and the late assertion
only on november 6, 2025, together demonstrate in my view a deliberate and
calculated tactic (or, at minimum, a “marked indifference”) to guide the case
to drift beyond the ceiling.


on this record, i go beyond a finding of “marked
indifference” and conclude there was an intent to delay as a tactic.

the conduct was not a passive acceptance of
adjournments. the transcripts reflect repeated, deliberate defence requests for
additional time, further negotiations, and indulgences from the court and the
crown, with no evidence of meaningful progress in the background. the defence
persisted in pursuing a global resolution that was never realistically attainable
and previously denied, which reinforces that the resulting delay was a matter
of choice rather than acquiescence.
b.
crown “ready to proceed” on december 13, 2023 – waiting on defence

the
crown’s trial readiness is first recorded
clearly on december 13, 2023, when the crown stated the impaired matter was
ready to proceed to trial, but no crown pre‑trial had been held. the
court directed that a cpt be scheduled. a cpt did not occur until february 8,
2024.

the defence writes in their materials:
“this is not a
complex case; rather, it is a simple one without any significant trial issues
or witnesses, and without voluminous disclosure. there are no discreet [sic] events
or exceptional circumstances that justify the delay.”

i agree; notwithstanding, the transcripts show
defence requests for adjournment after adjournment under a generalized claim of
‘ongoing resolution,’ rather than setting trial dates, including march 6, march
27, april 17, may 1, june 5, and july 3, 2024.

the defence submits that:
“[u]pon being
retained, defence has taken all necessary steps to expedite the matter and
schedule dates once a global resolution was not obtained for the applicant.”

such a position is untenable on this record. the opposite
occurred. i accept the crown’s submission that:
“throughout
the history of the matter the crown and the court had been ready to proceed,
but the defence was not. the matter was delayed by lengthy periods of
inactivity and defence failure to take meaningful steps to progress the
matter.”


not only did the defence fail to take “all
necessary steps to expedite the matter” as claimed, but it also took steps that
delayed it.

if not for the court’s order on january 22,
2025, making it peremptory on the defence to set trial dates, i have no
confidence a trial date would have been scheduled on january 30, 2025, either.

at no point in the proceedings did defence take
any proactive measures to move the matter forward in an expeditious manner and
this is why i have reached the conclusion that delay was the intent.
a.
a stay is not available for delay of the defence’s making

the supreme court’s decision in
r v cody
confirms that defence‑caused delay includes periods attributable to
defence conduct, and those periods must be deducted so the defence does not
obtain a benefit from self‑created delay. here, the application seeks a
stay based on the delay generated or tolerated by the defence. the framework
does not permit such a result.

i agree with the respondent that on this record,
the repeated adjournments for “global resolution,” coupled with express
waivers, and the failure to flag
s. 11
(b) when trial was set, are properly
treated as defence‑caused delay.


the transcripts and the charted history speak
for themselves and are at odds with the defence’s attempt to minimize its
conduct. i highlight the salient portions below.

on february 16, 2024, the crown communicated a
firm resolution position. in his email, a/ca paul renwick advised defence that
a non‑criminal resolution would not be offered and directed counsel
either to resolve on the offences charged or set the matter for trial.


rather than set trial dates and continue any
resolution discussions in the background, defence maintained that resolution
was close and sought further adjournments on that premise.

from march to august 2024, defence repeatedly
sought adjournments for disclosure review, resolution discussions, and pre‑trial
scheduling rather than setting trial dates, notwithstanding the crown’s
february 16, 2024, communication that the matter should resolve on the charges
or proceed to trial.

even accepting that resolution discussions (global or otherwise)
were ongoing, they were pursued at the defence’s request and recorded through
successive adjournments accompanied by express
section 11
(b) waivers (aug 14,
sep 4, sep 25, oct 9, nov 6, nov 26, 2024; tabs 19–24).

whatever the objective of seeking a global resolution on other
outstanding charges in another jurisdiction, those discussions should not have
impeded the expeditious progression of these matters if
section 11
(b) was to be
raised at a later date. resolution efforts can proceed in the background while
firm deadlines are maintained, focusing all participants on the scheduled
hearing. properly managed, such parallel efforts may facilitate resolution
without the cost of delay.

between august 14 and december 18, 2024, defence
expressly waived
section 11
(b) at successive attendances. this runs counter to
any pressing 11(b) concerns.

after december 18, 2024, the matter ought to
have been promptly set; the delay to january 30, 2025, is attributable to
defence inactivity. when trial was set above the ceiling on january 30, 2025,
defence did not raise
section 11
(b) until november 6, 2025, depriving the crown
and the court of any meaningful opportunity to mitigate.

as it became apparent that further adjournments
would not be granted on the strength of unparticularized “defence requests,”
waivers were required and provided, making clear that any resulting delay was
attributable to the defence (see jan 22, 2025, peremptory order; tab 26).

these efforts inevitably proved fruitless considering
the crown’s february 16, 2024, email declining any noncriminal resolution and
directing that trial dates be set.


on february 12, 2025, when the trial dates were
set, the presiding justice asked whether any pre‑trial motions were
anticipated. defence answered “no,” and added that the matter would proceed “as
a blended trial with the
charter.” in the circumstances, no discrete pre‑trial
applications were identified or scheduled at that time,
notably nothing
relating to delay and 11(b) of the
charter.
c.
the non-attendance of counsel

it is worth noting that counsel of record, mr.
rupinjit singh bal, did not appear for the accused at any stage. on each
appearance, a non‑lawyer agent addressed the court, often on vague or
guarded instructions; and on at least one occasion
inaccurate instructions.


despite ms. gill’s capable submissions at the
section 11
(b) hearing, she is not counsel of record;
mr. bal has yet to
appear.
while i did not let it disrupt the proceedings, as mr. khosa was
content that ms. gill make submissions, at no point did the court permit anyone
other than counsel of record to attend to make submissions on a pre-trial
motion. counsel of record was presumptively expected to attend and that did not
happen nor was any explanation provided. i mention this to illustrate the
issues raised in this section, and not in anyway to disparage counsel who did
attend and made helpful and appreciated submissions.

this underscores the importance of counsel
attendance on contentious matters so that complete and accurate information can
be placed on the record, including the status of negotiations and any
disclosure issues.

in oral submissions, the defence relied on disclosure timing to recast
adjournments as institutional or inherent. i disagree. the record shows that disclosure
was available at an early stage, and no evidentiary foundation was filed to
establish late or inadequate disclosure. to the extent disclosure issues in
another jurisdiction arose, the resulting adjournments were defence requests
pursued for global resolution and accompanied by
section 11
(b) waivers. the
authorities invoked do not assist in the absence of supporting evidence and in
light of clear defence‑driven adjournments on this record.

while counsel may engage agents for administrative appearances,
this practice carries the risk that statements advanced in support of a section
11(b) claim lack the necessary detail. matters best known to counsel of record,
including the particulars underlying delay assertions, may not be placed on the
record with adequate specificity.
d.
late
assertion and apportioned delay

as the respondent has pointed out,
section 11
(b) was first
raised—apart from earlier waivers and denials (approximately 32.5 months) after
the arrest and 75 days before the scheduled trial. in practical terms, the
defence moved from waiving delay, to denying that delay was at issue when
asked, to silence, and then to asserting a breach and seeking the most severe
remedy only weeks before trial. this timing deprived the crown and the court of
any meaningful opportunity to mitigate.

as also pointed out, and despite this urgency of
the violation raised by the defence¸ “the matter was adjourned to november 20, 2025,
so that the motion dates could be scheduled. however, the applicant had still
not scheduled a motion by that date. the matter was adjourned yet again to
november 27, 2025, to put motion dates on record.”

e.
the
obligations of defence counsel to raise issues relating to delay

defence counsel is expected to raise any
section
11
(b) concern when trial dates are set. silence at that stage deprives the
crown and the court of a meaningful opportunity to mitigate delay, including by
seeking earlier dates or by prioritizing or stacking the matter where
scheduling practice permits.

courts have recognized that where trial dates
are set above the
jordan
ceiling and defence remains silent, a portion
of the period from the date set to the anticipated end of trial may be
attributed to defence delay.

this duty of the defence is not optional and creates a positive obligation to
raise these issues in a timely manner so mitigative steps are possible.


to be timely within the meaning of
j.f.,
the issue must be raised early enough to allow those mitigation steps to be
taken. where the defence remains silent after dates are set beyond the ceiling,
courts have frequently attributed a portion of the interval from the setting of
dates to the anticipated end of trial, often 50 percent, to defence‑caused
delay, provided there is a basis to conclude that mitigation was realistically
possible had the issue been raised promptly.

i find as a fact that defence failed to raise
11(b) concerns in a prompt manner; an, for reasons expanded upon below as it
relates to local practices, such a failure significantly contributed to the
delay in this case.
f.
apportioned delay when the defence is silent

in several of the above-cited decisions where
defence failed to raise 11(b) concerns, the, courts have applied a 50 percent
allocation, sometimes allowing a brief interval for defence to obtain
transcripts before the attribution begins. the principle is also consistent
with the supreme court’s direction in
j.f. that delay concerns must be raised
in a timely way. justice p.f. monahan of this courthouse in peel region, attune
to the local practices that this case is subsumed under, summarized this
development in the case law well in the case of
r. v. lokubalasuriya:
[a]
considerable body of law is developing at the ontario court of justice (“ocj”)
level to the effect that the failure of defence to proactively assert their
client’s
section 11
(b) rights may lead to having some defence delay attributed
to the defence. relying on
jordan,
cody
and j.f., a number of ocj
courts have held that where a defendant sets a trial date above the jordan
ceiling and says nothing about
section 11
(b) concerns, then some portion of
time associated with the delay in raising these issues should be attributed as
defence delay. in particular a number of ocj judges have attributed as defence
delay 50% of the time from when the dates are set until the trial date or, in
some cases only until the crown is put on notice that the defence intends to
bring a
section 11
(b) application: see
r. v. nigro
2023 oncj 41
(per
justice west);
r. v. ahmed
(unreported per justice caponecchia);
r.
v. a.d. (unreported per justice lai);
r v. macdonald
(unreported per
justice daviau);
r. v. kullab
2023 oncj 458; and
r. v. m.w.
2023
oncj 581. courts have in some cases allowed defence counsel 2 to 4 weeks after
the trial dates are set for defence to order transcripts of past court
attendances in order to finalize the defence’s position on
section 11
(b) (see
ahmed
and
m.w.)

the crown submits that where defence remains
silent after trial dates are set beyond the
jordan
ceiling, courts have
frequently attributed 50 percent of the interval from the date set to the
anticipated end of trial to defence delay, to reflect the crown’s lost ability
to mitigate.

the respondent’s calculation attributes 50 percent of the 356 days from january
30, 2025 to january 19, 2026, namely 177 days, to defence delay.


i agree with this submission on apportioned
delay; however, i differ on when that attribution should be applied to the
crown. in this case, that window runs from november 6, 2025, to january 19,
2026, a span of 74 days. a 50 percent allocation therefore yields 37 days of
defence‑attributed delay in that late‑assertion period.

even if a broader, generous attribution were
applied as the crown submits, from january 30, 2025, to january 19, 2026 (354
days), the 50 percent allocation would be 177 days. in either approach, the
defence‑attributed deduction is appropriate on this record and falls well
below the
jordan
ceiling.


i reject the defence submission that institutional factors or
other court matters prevented timely scheduling.

the trial/preliminary inquiry scheduling form reflects that
earlier january dates were offered, and the crown was available while the
defence was not. local scheduling practices in peel permit prioritization or
stacking when
section 11
(b) is flagged promptly. had the defence raised delay
at the trial‑setting stage, realistic mitigation existed. on this record,
the inability to secure earlier dates was not due to institutional
unavailability; it resulted from defence posture and late signaling.
g.
local practices in scheduling dates, stacking, and prioritization in
peel region

the crown’s materials also describe local
practices in peel to prioritize or stack matters when
section 11
(b) is flagged
promptly. this satisfies the requirement articulated in authorities cited by
the crown

that there be a basis to find the crown could have taken steps to bring the
matter under the ceiling had defence acted in a timely way and that any late‑assertion
allocation should be supported by evidence that mitigation of delay was
realistically possible had defence raised its
s. 11
(b) concerns earlier.

the respondent’s record accurately addresses
local peel scheduling practices (including stacking and priority scheduling
when 11(b) is signalled) and identifies earlier january trial dates that the
crown could accommodate but defence could not, demonstrating concrete mitigation
potential.


as a local judge familiar with these practices, i am satisfied
that significant mitigation could have occurred through prioritizing or
stacking the matter had the defence acted diligently and raised delay concerns
when they first became apparent.

the issue should have been raised at the time trial dates were
set. if the dates still exceeded the jordan timeline, the matter could then
have been brought before a local administrative judge to seek prioritization.
those steps might have expedited the case, but the defence’s silence made such
mitigation impossible.

while it is insignificant on the total calculation,
it must be noted that the trial/preliminary inquiry scheduling form shows that
earlier january dates were offered, with the crown available and defence
unavailable, and that january 19–21, 2026 were thereafter set when both were
available.
h.
the obligations of new counsel in taking over a file and how it
relates to 11(b) considerations

it is worthwhile to turn my attention to the
issue relating to the transfer of a file from one lawyer to another and how
that can contribute to delay if obligations are not fulfilled.

when counsel is retained partway through a
matter, whether from a self‑represented accused or from previous counsel,
the obligation to advance the case promptly is heightened.

it is not acceptable to reset the file and
proceed at the same pace as if proceeding from early stages in the criminal
file. counsel must promptly review disclosure, identify and request any
outstanding items, connect with the assigned crown, and acquaint themselves
with any existing
s. 11
(b) considerations.

a change of counsel does not justify attributing
any resulting delay to the crown or the court. generally, there should be no
gap in the pace of the proceeding; to the extent a gap arises from a change of
counsel, that gap is presumptively attributable to the defence.

exceptions may exist. for example, where
substantive disclosure was not provided despite reasonable diligence of
previous counsel, but such instances are rare and fact‑specific and must
be assessed in the context of the transition. put simply, counsel who assume
carriage of a file should do everything reasonably possible to achieve the same
state of knowledge and pace as diligent prior counsel. counsel must “hit the
ground running” and not go back to the starter blocks.

deliberate efforts to defer the inevitable, into
a sword in a
section 11
(b) application. not only is this not permitted under
jordan,
cody, j.f.,
etc., applications brought under this tactic undermine
efficient case management by discouraging good‑faith resolution efforts
in other matters where counsel properly seek short adjournments with clear
waivers. it places the crown and court into unnecessary defensive positions
when they can no longer rely on representations that delay is not in issue only
to be sprung with threats of 24(1) relief on the eve of trial.
v.
jordan
-compliant trial scheduling practice direction

in consideration of such applications, it is
unsurprising that the ontario court of justice promulgated the
jordan
‑compliant
trial scheduling practice direction.

its purpose is to ensure early trial‑date setting and timely 11(b)
signalling so that firm dates are maintained and the right to be tried within a
reasonable time is safeguarded. those protocols were not followed here.

part ii of the ontario court of justice’s
‘jordan‑compliant trial scheduling’ practice direction applies because
the information was sworn on february 21, 2023.

the practice direction states that “part ii of
this practice direction applies to all criminal cases with an information sworn
date before november 1, 2023.” at the early stage, the accused appeared self
‑
represented with an interpreter. the practice direction applies,
with necessary modifications, to self
‑
represented accused; the
sr
‑
jpt proposed by the court was appropriate within those protocols.

the ontario court of justice’s scheduling
directives require that trial dates be set using the trial/preliminary inquiry
scheduling form and a scheduling conference and provide that if a trial is
scheduled more than 18 months from the information date, a section 11(b)
application will be scheduled unless the defence confirms it will not bring
one.

this case did not comply.
vi.
conclusion

as a final calculation, i accept the
respondent’s concession that the interval from may 24 to august 29, 2023,
reflects unavailability of an earlier self‑represented judicial pre‑trial
date. i treat may 24 to june 24, 2023 (31 days) as neutral time pending the
first available sr‑jpt, and june 25 to august 29, 2023 (65 days) as
institutional scheduling delay. neither interval is deducted as defence‑caused
delay. the sr‑jpt was set on the first available date offered by the
court, and there is no basis to attribute this time to the defence.

therefore, only the late
‑
assertion
window beginning november 6, 2025, is attributed, on a principled basis, at 50
percent to the defence. that window is 74 days; the 50 percent allocation is 37
days. deducting defence‑caused delay and waiver as set out above, and
treating may 24 to june 24, 2023, as neutral time and june 25 to august 29, 2023,
as institutional scheduling delay, the net delay is 307 days (approximately
10.1 months).

even if i am wrong and a 50 percent allocation were applied from
the date the trial was set to the start of trial (january 30, 2025, to january
19, 2026: 354 days; 50 percent attribution: 177 days), the net delay would
remain well below the presumptive ceiling after deducting remaining defence‑caused
delay. to be clear, this is an alternative scenario only; the
preceding paragraph reflects my actual calculations, including my findings
regarding defence‑caused delay.

this alternative computation is provided solely
to demonstrate that, even on the crown’s broader attribution from the trial‑setting
date, the resulting net delay remains below the presumptive ceiling after
deducting defence‑caused delay and waiver.

the application is dismissed.

justice s. robichaud

the ordering dates reflected on the
transcripts show that, apart from the transcript ordered in october 2025, all
transcripts were ordered on or after november 17, 2025. defence conceded in
oral submissions that the october transcript was ordered for a bail variation,
not for a
s. 11
(b) motion. in these circumstances, the agent’s representation
that transcripts had been ordered for the
s. 11
(b) application was, at its most
charitable interpretation, misleading. there is therefore no evidence that the
issues surrounding 11(b) were considered until november 17, 2025.

this relates to erroneous
representations that 11(b) transcripts were ordered. this is not accurate. only
one transcript was ordered in october and that was for the purpose of a bail
variation, not 11(b). see further footnote below.

at one point in oral submissions,
defence counsel ms. gill asserted that disclosure of body
‑
worn camera footage was
delayed. the crown, aca horic, responded that this was inaccurate and not
supported in the applicant’s materials. i do not make a definitive finding on
this point; however, the applicant’s materials do not disclose any late or
inadequate disclosure. an allegation of this significance ought to have been
supported by filed material if it were to be relied upon and should not be
raised for the first time in oral submissions without an evidentiary
foundation.
