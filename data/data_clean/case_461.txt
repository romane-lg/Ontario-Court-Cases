overview

j.f. and
s.s. pleaded guilty before me to
charges arising from
the swarming and ensuing death of a
homeless man, kenneth lee, in the early morning hours of 18 december 2022.
jf and ss were in a
group of 8 at the time. both pleaded guilty after a preliminary
hearing.
j.f. was committed for trial
on the charge of second degree murder but pleaded guilty on june 24, 2024 to
manslaughter.
s.s. was committed for
trial on the charge of
manslaughter
but pleaded guilty on june 4, 2024 to the charges of assault causing bodily
harm and assault with a weapon.
on
those days each admitted
to
the
factual
and
legal
requirements
of
each
offence.
each
testified
under oath
and
confirmed
that
they
were
admitting
to
the
elements
of
the
offence
they
had pleaded guilty to.
accordingly, each was found guilty of each
offence.

after entering the guilty pleas
both j.f. and s.s. filed applications alleging
charter
infringements and
to stay the charges because they were strip searched while being confined after
arrest.

this ruling follows the sentencing
hearings for two of the other participants: mj and ab, which are found at
r.
v. m.j.
2024 oncj 455, and
r. v. a.b.
2024 oncj 486. four of the
group are still before the superior court awaiting trial and for that reason i would
limit my discussion of their involvement.

the
charter
applications
for j.f. and s.s. proceeded together because there is a commonality to the
facts alleged in their
charter
applications. because of this it is
appropriate to decide their applications together.

several youth custody workers
testified at the
charter
application. for reasons only known to the
craigwood facility or the witnesses’ union most were
unwilling to provide statements in advance of their testimony
despite being asked by the crown. this was one of the reasons the evidentiary
portion of the
charter
application was prolonged.
the
court
is
disappointed
that
those
involved
in
the
statutory
confinement
of young persons were unwilling to
cooperate with legitimate crown requests for information about the goings on in
their facility.
this does not meet
the high standards expected of custodial officers in this province.
facts
custodial
periods
and
strip
searches

all 8 young persons were initially
charged with second degree murder.
7
had a joint show cause hearing before sirivar j. over several days in january
and february of 2023.
jf and ss were
part of that group of 7.
jf was
released by sirivar j. on february 9, 2023 with written reasons released on
june 4, 2023. ss was released from custody after 41 days. reasons for bail were
released on april 14, 2023.

there is no dispute that ss was
strip searched three times before her release on bail: twice on december 19,
2022 – once when she was admitted to the craigwood youth custody facility (“craigwood”),
and once when she was returned from court that day; and a third time on january
20, 2022 when she returned from court.

jf was strip searched seven times:
twice on december 19, 2022 when she first arrived at woodview and a second time
when she arrived later that evening from court; once on january 13, 2023 when
she arrived from the hospital; january 20, 2023 when she arrived from court; on
july 7 and 11, 2023 when she arrived from court; and once on august 29, 2024
when she arrived at woodview.
the
july 7 strip search is recorded both as july 7, 2008 and also july 7, 2023 when
was dropped off to the woodview program (which is run by
craigwood) by the peel police.

the january 13, 2023 strip search
of jf occurred after she had been taken to a local
hospital.
while
at
the
hospital
she
was
handcuffed
but
was
out
of
sight
of
her
youth
guards while she was providing a urine sample.
that was the triggering event for that strip search, namely that she was
out of sight of the guards while providing a urine sample even though she was
handcuffed at the time.

documents filed on the application
record the strip searches, although as will be seen it is unclear that each
record is accurate.
the july 7, strip
search for jf was recorded as july 7, 2008 which is impossible and that
document had the name “tiffany” as the staff member completing the search but
in her evidence ms. bourne was clear that she did not sign that strip search
record, and she knows of no other tiffany at woodview. it is therefore unclear
who strip searched jf on july 7, 2023.

several youth custody workers
testified at the
charter
application and identified the strip search
records. tiffany bourne was one of them.
she
worked at woodview where jf and ss were held in custody while on remand.
she started at woodview in december 2022
and finished there in august 2023.
conducting
strip searches was one of her roles. she was trained for that both in person
and via on line education.
one of the
strip search
records of
jf
has
her
name
on
it
but
she could
not
identify
the signature on it as hers.
the
date on that was july 7, 2008 which is clearly wrong.
when asked if she strip searched jf on july 7, 2023 she did not
remember that.
she testified that jf
looked familiar but had no independent recollection of her.
she had no memory of ss. she disagreed
that she could ever do a strip search and not fill out a record of it.

ms. bourne described the strip
search procedure at woodview, which involved two youth workers: one with the
youth; and another down the hall monitoring the first youth worker. the
monitoring officer could not see the youth.
strip
searches were done in a nurses room. the youth is given a towel. and told to
remove clothing and cover up with the towel.
the removed clothing is inspected for objects and the youth is asked to
open the towel to see the front half, and then spin around to expose the back
half. clothes are then given back.
ms.
bourne testified that she faces the youth when they take their clothes off, and
told the youths to cover themselves while they remove their clothes.
at
no
time
is
the
person
totally
nude
because
the
towel
is
a
partial
cover. once the search is complete new clothes are provided and the
youth showers in the nurses room.

youths can deny the strip search.
ms. bourne testified that woodview cannot force the youth to strip search but
if they don’t then they cannot participate in programs. the strip search is
required to eliminate contraband like weapons or snacks from the
youth.
ms.
bourne testified that the strip searching procedure lasts about a minute or
two.

chelsea jackson was another youth
worker who gave evidence.
she
remembered jf to a point and remembers doing a strip search of her.
nothing out of the ordinary happened when
she did that.
her description of the strip
search procedure was similar to ms. bourne’s. she added that the cover up towel
was an
option and if the youth says
no
to
the towel they
would be fully naked.
she knew
that
the no towel
option
was not in compliance with craigwood
policy. she could not remember if jf did not
want the towel. in her evidence, most youths being strip searched just
want it over with and say no to the towel, but she always tells them there is a
towel there to cover up
with. she
testified that she never touches the youth during the procedure or removes
their clothing.
ms. jackson also
identified documents which recorded ss being strip searched at the same time.
she put the total time of total nudity at
around 20 seconds.

another youth worker still at woodview
who testified was kelsey campbell. she conducts strip searches of youths in
accordance with the craigwood policy document dated october 1, 2022.
her description of the strip search
procedure was the same as ms. jackson.
ms.
campbell said that a routine strip search takes maybe 30 seconds – “not even a
minute”.
ms. campbell said that since
she was originally trained to do strip searches there was a policy review of
the practise.
she was told that
youths could be naked on their top half and then on the bottom half of their
body.
ms. campbell told her
supervisors that that is not in the policy. she has not done a strip search
since.

hasanati
alexander
was
a
youth
worker
at
woodview
and
had
looked
at
the
strip search policy as well as the
ministry standards about them.
she
did 3 searches at woodview and found no contraband.
she remembers strip searching jf but cannot remember which day.
she testified that she did the strip
searches the same way. a towel was provided and the upper half of the youth’s
body was bared.
the towel was to then
cover the bare portion and the other half of the young person was exposed.
a quick turn around was done after that.
two staff persons were involved but only
one could see the young person.
she
said that some young persons were comfortable
being fully nude and there were are no rules about complete nudity.
it is possible that
jf was completely naked during one of the strip searches.

she
was
asked
about
strip
searching
s.s.
and
said
that
she
tried
not
to
remember because it is in the moment. the process is uncomfortable for both the
youth and the youth worker.

jo-lyn
vercuteren
finished
working
at
craigwood
this
past
november.
she testified that she had never seen the ministry standards for strip
searches before testifying.
she was
never trained on the woodview search policy, but she read it over annually. ms.
vercuteren said that on january 20, 2023 she did a routine strip search of ss
following court.
she testified that
she also strip searched jf that day.
she
asked
jf if that was ok.
she knew that totally nudity was
prohibited during strip searches, but at some point she saw the youths in that
state.
she did not realize that was a
problem relative to her training.
total
nudity would last about 30 seconds.

ms.
vercuteren
had
given
a
statement
saying
that
she
required
to
see
the
young
person totally nude, but she didn’t need
that.
in her evidence her supervisor
mr. goman asked her to change her statement about the duration of total nudity
for the young person – from 30 seconds to 5 seconds.
mr. goman denied ever saying that to her.

mr.
goman
testified
that
woodview
is
not
operational.
it
is
no
longer
accepting inmates.
that
was
a
ministry
of
children,
community
and
social
services
(mccss) decision (“the ministry”) and there is no plan to send young
people to woodview. he explained that the closure decision was based on a staff
shortage at woodview.
there is a very
small possibility that woodview will ever open again, and the reasons for its
closure have nothing to do with this case.

mr. goman worked at craigwood from
june of 2009 and joined management in 2014.
he
was aware of the strip search policy at woodview and the ministry policy
changes regarding the strip searching of inmates.
as he put it, woodview’s policies must
follow
and
meet
ministry
standards.
he
was
aware
that the
ministry policy in policy 3.7 prohibited complete undress of inmates
during the strip search procedure.
mr.
goman admitted to writing the updated craigwood policy procedure of october 1,
2022. the policy update procedure involves providing the updated policy to the
ministry for review for 30 days before implementation.
on this basis the craigwood policy titled “searches”
dated october 1, 2022 was provided to the
ministry for comment before its implementation.
there is no evidence that the ministry had any comment on the
october 1, 2022 search procedure.

he testified about the strip
search procedure, and that the october
1,
2022
policy permitted routine strip
searches in the circumstances outlined in page 3 – 4 of
that document, namely:
i)-upon
admission;
ii)-upon
re-entry
to
the
unit
from
an
unescorted
pass; iii)-after unsupervised visits;
iv)-prior
to
transporting
young
persons
out
of
the
unit
due
to
the
nature
of
the situation where safety
may be an issue, and;
v)-when
there
are
safety/security
issues

mr. goman testified to the
training which was given to staff about the search policy.
they received training which involved
distribution to staff by email and discussion in person.
there was also orientation at the craigwood head office. he
expected that all staff were aware of the policy.

mr. goman explained that the
policy change of october 1, 2022 required no complete
nudity
during
the strip
search. routine strip searches
in
situations
i), ii),
and
iii)
required no managerial approval whereas iv) and v) do.

additionally, mr. goman testified
that the october 1, 2022 procedure statement had additional language, namely:
the young person will be given the opportunity to remove
their own clothing and must not be completely undressed for any period of time
(e.g. the young person
is
given
a
sheet
while
they
are
undressing
so
they
are
not
left
standing
undressed
for
any
period
of
time).
all
strip
searches
of
young
persons
will
be done quietly, quickly,
thoroughly, and in private.

mr. goman provided evidence about
the structure of craigwood and woodview. craigwood is a licensed agency which
provides facilities to the ministry for the custody of young persons.
it receives an annual licencing.
there is a 4 day annual audit or review by
the ministry.

mr. goman had testified at the
joint bail hearing for 7 of the charged youths before sirivar j. during that
testimony he gave evidence that none of the young
persons were totally nude during the strip search procedure at
woodview.
before me he testified that
strip searches of young persons involving total nudity were happening
at other facilities, not woodview.
that is what he meant by not being aware
of any
such strip searches leading
to
total
nudity.
his explanation
made
little
sense to
me. the questioning at the
bail hearing was focussed on strip searches at woodview.
before sirivar j. he was asked directly about jf being left
completely naked when being searched at woodview.
he answered that such a scenario was concerning.
his evidence before me that there was no
challenge to strip searching at woodview until recently makes no sense. his
evidence that the concerns about strip searching were focussed on another
facility makes no sense.
his evidence
flies in the face of his evidence at the bail hearing before sirivar j.
his evidence that there was no review of
the strip searching policy at woodview after the joint bail hearing also makes
little
sense.
having been confronted on january 31, 2023 with an allegation of
total nudity during searches of arriving young persons at woodview his evidence
is that nothing
was done to review
the woodview search
procedure.

mr. goman also provided evidence
about the reason for the october 1, 2022 search policy document.
these include health and safety for both
inmates and staff. weapons and drugs are the primary concerns.
he said that such contraband has been
found about a half dozen times that he is aware of, and that they would not
have been found with a search less intrusive than a strip search.
he said that such things can be concealed
under a waist band or under a bra.
once
something was found in an
inmates
hair.
jewelry can be converted to a
weapon, and plastic can be used to interfere with locks in doors. he has
personally witnessed all manner of self harm or harm to other inmates.

mr. goman was confronted with the
suggestion that he encouraged jo lyn vercuterin to change her position on the
length of the strip search.
he denied
pressuring her at all.
an email was
put into evidence which confirmed that mr. goman asked ms. de
filippis if he could speak with ms. vercuterin about
her submissions on the
strip
searching issue
and was
told
by
email less
than
an
hour
not
to.
he
testified
that by
the time he received ms. de filippis’ email he had already spoken to her, and
that ms. vercuterin stood by her written response to the crown.

his evidence that he did not know
when he testified at the show cause that he was
being
questioned
about
woodview
is
not
believable.
with
that
said,
i
accept
the balance
of
his
evidence,
and
i
would
not
reject
his
evidence
as
incredible.
his
experience with why
young persons
are searched on arrival at
woodview
makes sense.

two
agreed statements of
facts
(asf) were
filed at the
charter
application. the first
covered another
youth facility sundance,
which is another temporary
detention
and custody facility for females held while facing ycja proceedings. sundance
had been requiring youths being strip searched to be totally nude for a
portion of the procedure, which is
inconsistent with ministry policy 3.7.
sometime
in 2023 sundance management realized that its strip search policy did not conform
with ministry policy.

this asf outlined that on january
26, 2023 justice sirivar made an order prohibiting sundance from conducting a
routine strip search of one of jf and ss’ co- accused.
that order lead to sundance becoming aware of the inconsistency
between their strip search procedure and ministry policy 3.7.
sundance enacted a new search policy on
january 4, 2024 which is clear that at no time can a youth who is being
searched be permitted to be completely naked.

the second asf outlines the manner
in which the ministry licences and funds outside agencies to provide youth
custody facilities in ontario.
until
november of 2024 the ministry had three: don doucet in sault ste. marie, which
is directly operated by the ministry; sundance which is an outside agency
operating under ministry licence and funding (which is called
a transfer payment recipient, or tpr); and
woodview (which is also a tpr).
there
are two open detention facilities, one run in brampton and another thunder bay
which are also tprs).

notably, the ministry established
standards regarding searches in all youth custody facilities, whether they are
directly operated by the ministry or privately run tprs.
ministry policy 3.7 in appendix “a” is one such directive.
policy 3.7 is not publicly-accessible.
it
is
only available internally to ministry personnel or tpr staff via
a password protected internet.

the ministry oversees tprs by both
licencing, which involves both annual and quadrennial reviews, and through the
tpr funding agreement which contractually obliges the tpr to comply with
ministry guidelines and requirements.

the annual review of a tpr
involves ministry licensing inspectors to physically attend the tpr.
the inspection takes from 5-10 days, and
assesses whether the facility is in compliance with ministry requirements,
including documentation and
whether
the tprs procedures are current to ministry policy.
the quadrennial review is comprehensive and covers similar
ground.
the reviews lead to a report
by the
inspector which is provided to
the tpr and is expected to result in compliance.

one of the results of justice
sirivar’s january 26, 2023 order was that the ministry began
a review of its six youth
detention facilities.
it was during this review that sundance
was found to be non-compliant with ministry strip search policy.

sirivar j.’s january 6 2023 ruling
came to the knowledge of the west region of the ministry, where woodview is
located.
it lead to a review of
woodview’s policies. woodview advised the ministry that it was aware of the
issues at sundance but that woodview had a different strip search policy.
in the summer of 2024 woodview advised the
ministry that there was an issue with strip searches at their facility.
this lead to an internal review of the
strip search policy at woodview and a full re-training of
staff.

dr. nina vitopoulos provided two
written reports about the effects of strip searching on both jf and ss.
she gave evidence viva voce and was
qualified as an expert in clinical and forensic psychology, developmental
psychology, and the psychological effect of trauma on youth.
in her evidence every strip search has a
high possibility of trauma to a youth. routineness of a strip search is
traumatic to a youth because of its arbitrariness.
dr. vitopoulos therefore focussed on the routineness of strip
searching and lack of explanation to the subject about the reason for the
procedure.
both lead to adverse
psychological effects on youth who are subjected to the practise.
impact
on
each
young
person

both ss and jf filed assessment
reports from dr. vitopoulos.
both
contain statements by each young person about the effects of the strip
searching.
the crown did not object
to their evidence going in this way.
s.s.

in her report s.s. described the
experience of being strip searched three times. the first was upon her entry to
woodview on december 19, 2022.
she
had never been in custody before.

generally s.s. found her time in
isolating custody difficult and depressing.
once
the isolation period ended she got along with her peers for the most part. she
was in regular contact with her parents, although it is unclear how many times
she actually spoke with her father.

notably, she described being strip
searched 3 times.
the first incident
on december 19, 2022 took about 30 minutes to comply because she was deeply
uncomfortable having to remove her clothes in front of an adult stranger.
she had to turn around while fully naked
in front
of one staff
member.
she reported that there were two staff members present during this first
strip search. this appears to have exacerbated her body image insecurities.

when she was strip searched the
second time that day she was offered the choice to take off her clothes on
piece at a time and cover herself with a towel during
the procedure.
that
was a change from the first strip search earlier in the day.
on the second strip search
on
december
19 she felt
like she
had
more privacy and the
process when faster than the first.
when she was offered the option of only
taking one item
off
at
a
time
she
opted
to
fully
strip
naked
because
she
believed
the
process
would
go
more quickly.

the third strip search happened
when ss had come back from court.
it
was at the direction of the staff person who did the second strip search.
there was a second staff person behind a
door.
in
the third incident she was told to “spin” during the search and that a staff
member held a towel up for
her
privacy during the process.
on the
third strip search she was again given the option of taking her clothes off one
piece at a time or all at once.
she
chose the latter to get it over more quickly.

overall s.s. reported being
moderately insecure about her body when she was first arrested but those
insecurities became substantially more intense after the strip searchings.
she was very uncomfortable with adults
seeing her body.
this in turn
contributed to restricted eating when she was ultimately released from custody.

s.s. reported that the custodial
experience “could have been better” and “could have been worse”.
her ten day isolation period when she
arrived at woodview was the most difficult part of the experience.
j.f.

dr. vitopoulos’ report on jf
covered 7 strip searches: december 19, 2022 (x2); january 13, 2023; january 20,
2023; july 7, 2023; july 11, 2023; and august 2024.

the jan. 13 search was identified
by counsel as particularly egregious because she was taken to a local hospital
by staff members in handcuff.
she was
apparently strip searched because she had to provide a urine sample at the
hospital and because of that was out of the sight of the custodial staff.
she argues that this strip search was
particularly egregious and impactful.

j.f. described her time in custody
as being “okay. with that said, she could describe two strip searches most
clearly for dr. vitopoulos. these were the ones on december 19, 2022 at intake
and on january 13, 2023.
she
remembered that at times when she was strip searched she was
both fully naked and also times when male
staff members
were
secondary
staff during
the
procedure.
she
felt
like
he
could
see
her. on one occasion she recalled a male
staff member walking into the room and popping around a corner.

j.f. recalls it being almost
impossible to use a towel as a modesty covering because she could not both hold
a towel up and also take off her pants.
j.f.
told dr. vitopoulos that she felt very uncomfortable during the strip search
process.
she adapted to the process,
getting used to it.
she felt
particularly uncomfortable on the
one
or two instances when she was completely naked. one time saying there was no
towel and
then being brought one by a
male guard who handed it over to a female
guard.

what is clear from the report of
dr. vitopoulos is that j.f. felt deeply uncomfortable
on
those
one
or
two
occasions
when
she
was
completely
naked.
with that said, the strip searches did not to her feel sexual. they were
to her weird. she felt very uncomfortable but did not see them as sexual trauma
as such.
analysis and
discussion

it is against those facts that
both ss and jf allege several different
charter
violations, and seek a
stay of proceedings or alternatively a sentence reduction.
they allege that their individual strip
searches and the institutional response result in violations of their rights
under ss.
7, 8, 12, and 15
of the
charter.

the applicants argue that the
strip searches violate s. 7 under the
charter
two ways: both as a
violation of the right to security of the person, and because the ministry
failed to supervise and monitor the use of strip searches.
the s. 12 claim is that a strip search is
a treatment or punishment, and the s. 15 claim is that routine strip searches
have a disproportionate impact on black female children, such as ss and jf.

the crown concedes that the strip
searching which resulted in ss and jf being completely naked is a s. 8
violation.
the crown argues that an
appropriate remedy is a sentence reduction but not a stay of proceedings.

some preliminary findings are
necessary at this stage.
the first
concerns the applicants’ claim that several
charter
sections are
engaged, ss. 7, 8, 12, and 15.

as regards the s. 7 claim, that
section of the
charter
does not expand a right already contained in s.
8. this was
established in
r. v. mills
1999 canlii 637 (scc),
 3 s.c.r. 668, at
pars 87- 88
where
the
court said
that, “…we infer that
a
reasonable
search
or seizure is consistent
with
the
principles
of
fundamental
justice”.
there
is
no
“…
incongruity
between ss7 and 8 – 14
related to principles of fundamental justice and not to the scope of life
liberty and security of the person”.

one of the components of the
applicants’ s. 7 claim is that there was insufficient supervision of the tprs.
factually the ministry conducted regular
audits of the tprs. as i will find the problem identified is that ministry
policy permitted jf and ss to be strip searched routinely, and that jf and ss
were completely nude during strip searches. this has little to do with the
auditing of tprs.
i reject the s. 7
claim accordingly.

as regards the s. 12 claim the
applicant’s claim must establish that the strip searching is either a treatment
or a punishment.
it is possible that
strip searching is a treatment for purposes of s. 12 because conditions of
detention can be a form of treatment for s. 12 purposes,
see
ogiamien v.
ontario
2017 onca 667
at par.
7.
the
challenge the applicant’s face is meeting the high bar to engage s. 12.
as laskin ja described it
in
ogiamien,
(at par.
9
), a treatment in custody will be grossly disproportionate for
purposes of s. 12 under the
charter
if the treatment is,
"so
excessive as to outrage standards of decency"; "grossly
disproportionate to what would have been appropriate"; "grossly
disproportionate for the offender, such that canadians would find the
punishment abhorrent or intolerable".

not every excessive or
disproportionate treatment amounts to a constitutional violation under s. 12,
see
ogiamien
at par.
9. so too here. i cannot conclude that the strip searching
as heard on the evidence here meets that high bar.
as will be discussed, later, the strip searching policy and
practice for youths in ontario is unreasonable, but it is nonetheless grounded
in entirely valid safety concerns for youth inmates and the staff supervising
them.
i would not find a s. 12
violation.

the applicants s.
15
claim
must
fail
too.
in
order to
establish
a s.
15
violation
the applicants must show on the evidence
that the strip search policy and practise created
a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous grounds on its
face or in its impact; and that it imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a
manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating
disadvantage,
see
r. v. sharma
2022 scc 39
at par.
28.

the applicants argument is that
“the use of routine strip searches in female youth detention centres has a
disproportionately negative impact on black female children”.
in support of that proposition several
studies were cited about the over incarceration of black youth in correctional
services.

the applicants argument fails, in
my finding by establishing a comparator group which are not subjected to the
strip search policy.
in this case the
strip search policy applies to all youths held in detention in provincial institutions.
it is of equal application
to the
entire youth custodial population.
more
to the point, the strip search policy is applied on a routine basis to all
youths entering the facility regardless of their ethnicity
or background.
that is one of the basis that i will later find what happened to
ss and
jf to be a
charter
violation
under s. 8, but the allegation of discriminatory conduct is significantly muted
when the claim is cast against the routine, universal strip search policy
applying to young persons entering the facility.

i would also find that youths have
an entirely different regime than adults when being held in custody before
detention.
they enjoy certain rights
not available to adults such as different levels of detention pre-trial, which
can be subjected to judicial review, see cyfsa s. 148(2) and (5).
given the number and substance of youth
custodial detention law i find that there is no comparator group for s. 15
purposes outside youths held pre-trial in detention. any comparator group must
be within the cohort of youths detained before trial. this is a small group,
but more to the point all youths held pre-trial are subjected to strip
searching.
the craigwood strip search
policy, despite other deficiencies requires searches of youths to accommodate
cultural, religious or spiritual values of
the searched youths.
as discussed
above, only a person of same sex may conduct the search.

for
these reasons
i
do
not
find
a s.
15
violation.

this is first and foremost a s. 8.
case.
the question of
constitutional violations other than s. 8
are redundant.
the claim of ancillary
constitutional violations outside s.
8
came before
the supreme court in
r. v. rodgers
2006 scc 15.
in
rodgers
the constitutionality
of
dna
databanking
was
in
issue.
the
appellant
made
claims
under
s.
8 of the
charter
but also ss 7,
11(h), and (i).
the court found, at
par. 23, that the legal analysis was properly undertaken within s. 8.
other arguments were redundant to that:
23.
the
crown
contends
that
the
constitutional
analysis
on
both
grounds
(a)
and
(b)
should
be
conducted
under
s.
8,
not
because
s.
7
is
not
triggered,
but because
s. 8
provides a more specific and complete
illustration of the
s. 7
right in this
particular
context,
making
any
s.
7
analysis
redundant.
i
agree.
mr. rodgers'
ex
parte
argument concerns the procedural
fairness of the
very process that
authorizes the seizure. in these circumstances, the question is necessarily
encompassed in the
s. 8
assessment of reasonableness and is more
properly considered in that context. as we shall see, what is fair depends
entirely on the context. this court described the rapport between
s. 8
and principles of fundamental justice in
r. v. mills,
1999 canlii 637 (scc),
 3 s.c.r. 668
(s.c.c.), where the interests at play were the right to make full answer and
defence and the complainant's privacy right. this court stated as follows (at
para. 88):
given that
s. 8
protects a person's privacy by
prohibiting unreasonable searches
or
seizures,
and
given
that
s.
8
addresses
a
particular
application of the principles of fundamental justice, we can infer that a
reasonable search or seizure is consistent with the principles of fundamental
justice. moreover, as we have already discussed, the principles of fundamental
justice include the right to make full answer and defence. therefore, a
reasonable search and seizure will be one that accommodates both the accused's
ability to
make
full answer
and
defence and the
complainant's privacy right.

i would adopt a similar analysis.
in this case the
charter
arguments
can be analyzed completely by asking whether the strip searching was completed
under a reasonable law and whether it was reasonably completed.
when the constitutional standard under
parallel
charter
sections is engaged it is not necessary to
make findings under both, or all
particularly where the remedy would be the same, see
r. v. malmo- levine
2003
scc 74
at
paras
159 - 162.

more recently,
in
r. v.
brunelle
2024 scc 3
the supreme court again
considered the co-existence of s. 7 with other
charter
sections.
speaking for the majority,
o’bonsawin
j. found (at par. 71)
that, “
…in the abuse
of
process
context, both s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 of the
charter
are intended to protect individuals from conduct that
is unfair or vexatious and thus undermines
the integrity of the justice system (o’connor at paras 64 and 73). it follows
that the frameworks for analyzing these provisions can
co-exist.”
it may be
appropriate to analyze
an
accumulation of
charter
infringements as an abuse of process, “..that
is, prejudice to the integrity of the justice system” (
brunelle
ibid).
given the permissible co-existence, i find
that in law this application can be analyzed from standpoint of the
constitutional guarantee embedded in s. 8.

another preliminary finding
involves the strip searches themselves.
i
heard evidence which is uncontradicted that strip searching at woodview
involves complete nudity
at
times.
despite
the
policy
prohibiting
complete
nudity
it
appears
that
young
persons
simply
opted
to
completely
undress
to
get
the
process
over
with
faster.
it
is unclear on the evidence
how many times this happened to either ss or jf.

in jf’s report from dr. vitopoulos
she discussed “…that there was one or two instances wherein she was completely
nude
during the searches and that these
had been especially uncomfortable”.

ss described three strip searches.
on the first, on december 19
she
removed
all her clothes at once as
per the staff member’s direction.
on
the second, later that
day she was
offered the choice of taking off her clothing one piece at a time. she opted to
completely strip down naked to get the search over more quickly. on the third
search she again chose to remove all her clothing at once to “get it over with
quickly”.

the evidence that both jf and ss
were completely naked during
some
of the strip searches is confirmed by
woodview personnel who testified that some young persons opted to go completely
naked as opposed to removing their clothing one piece at a time simply to get
it over with more quickly.

i would also find that there is no
evidence that the strip searching was done gratuitously.
the process was dictated by woodview’s policy, and not any
individual staff member’s inappropriate interest in seeing young persons naked.
there is no evidence of that.
the
question comes down to whether the policy
conformed
with
charter
principles and also whether the search practise as it
impacted jf and ss conformed with the policy. to the extent that both jf and ss
were completely nude during some of the strip searches the fact of complete
nudity did not conform with woodview’s policy prohibiting just that.

in this case there is no dispute
that what occurred was a search.
the
evidence
is uncontradicted that both
ss and jf were stripped of their clothing when they entered woodview for
purposes of searching
for contraband.
it is axiomatic
that
persons have a reasonable expectation of
privacy in their bodily integrity which is protected by s. 8
under the
charter,
see
r. v.
stillman
1997 canlii 384 (scc),
1997 carswellnb 107
at par.
42,
r. v. pohoretsky
1987 canlii 62 (scc),
 1
s.c.r. 945.

the supreme court in
r. v.
collins
1987 canlii 84 (scc),
 1 s.c.r. 265
at par.
33
articulated the appropriate general
frame work for scrutiny of s. 8 claims:
“a search will be reasonable if it is authorized by
law, if the law itself is reasonable and
if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable.”

in this case the authority for the
strip searching was furnished by o/reg 155/18.
it permitted, in par. 68.(4) searches of young persons which could
involve the removal
of all their
clothes.
it outlined 3 requirements
for such searches: at least two staff members; presumptively by persons of the
same sex unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that an immediate
search is necessary.
o/reg 155/18
then proceeds
to
require
the
person
in
charge
of
the
custodial
facility
to
develop
and
maintain written
procedures for searches of young persons.
the
craigwood policy directive dated october
1,
2022 titled searches
therefore is a
regulatory requirement imposed on craigwood, and its woodview facility.
it is directly related to o/reg 155/18.
there is,
therefore, legal authority for strip searching young persons at youth
detention facilities.

in argument i was asked to find
that ministry policy 3.7 has the effect of a regulation.
it is not necessary for this ruling to make that finding and i
decline to do so. while policy 3.7 is not publicly available and so lacks that
essential hallmark of a regulation it appears to have some considerable weight
in the development of craigwood’s october 1, 2022 search policy, even if the
craigwood policy takes its authority from o/reg 155/18 par. 69.

what is relevant for purposes of
examining whether the law authorizing the search is reasonable is that
craigwood sought to bring its search policy into alignment with ministry policy
directive.
even if policy 3.7 is not
a regulation as such, through it, the ministry had a pivotal role crafting the
regulatory search policy at woodview.

no analysis
of
a
legal
challenge
such
as
this
can
proceed without considering the statutory
privacy provisions in the ycja.
s. 3
of the ycja says:
3.
3(1) policy
for
canada
with
respect
to
young
persons
the following principles apply in this act:
(b)
the criminal
justice system for young
persons must be separate from that of adults, must be based on the principle of
diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability and must emphasize the
following:
(iii)
enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly
and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected.

the enhanced procedural
protections speaking to young persons privacy is found in many places within
the ycja. they principally enhance the informational privacy of youths by
protecting records of youth proceedings and requiring special procedures for
unsealing youth records. part 6 (ie ss 110 to 129) of the ycja is entirely
devoted to
the special protections
afforded young persons regarding their privacy from ycja prosecutions.

the privacy provisions of s. 3(1)(b)(iii)
are not, however,
limited to
informational privacy.
in
r.
v.
c.r.
2005 scc
61
the
court grappled with
dna
databanking
for
young
persons.
in
c.r.
the appellant
pleaded guilty to assault with a weapon after stabbing
his mother with a pen. the trial judge imposed sentence but
declined to order dna databanking under s. 487.051 of the
code.
the nova scotia court of appeal overturned
the
dna
databanking
order
and
required
a
sample
be
taken.
on
appeal,
fish
j.
for
the
majority
of
the
court
framed
the
issue
this
way
at
par.
32:
the
central controversy in this case is whether a youth court judge may, in
contemplating a dna order with respect to a young person, take into account the
underlying principles and defining characteristics of criminal justice
legislation adopted by parliament specifically for dealing with young persons.

the majority reversed the court of
appeal and upheld the trial judge’s refusal to order dna databanking. it did
not matter whether the case was considered under the previous
young
offenders act
or
youth criminal justice act.
it said,
37.
in
particular, parliament has taken care to ensure that the consequences of
conviction for young persons are imposed in a manner that advances the
objectives of youth criminal justice legislation. this legislative policy is
apparent
in both acts. to disregard
it is to frustrate parliament's will.

this
includes
the
right
to
privacy
under
s.
3(1)(b)(iii)
of
the
ycja.
in
the
case
of
c.r.
the legislative policy permitted a finding that the trial judge made no
error in declining to order dna databanking when balanced against the
circumstances of the youth and the case.

i would also observe that within
the hierarchy of expectations of privacy
under
s. 8 of the
charter, privacy of the person is the “…strongest claim to
constitutional shelter because it protects bodily integrity”,
see
r. v.
tessling
2004 scc 67
at par.
21.
the
privacy provisions in the ycja are therefore relevant beyond informational
privacy and include bodily integrity.
strip
searches involve bodily integrity and therefore attract the strongest
protection of the privacy interests under s. 8 of the
charter.
the
guidelines
for
strip
searching
young
persons
in
custody.

the
child, youth and family
services act,
s.o. 2017 c. 14
(
cyfsa
) provides
statutory authority for detention of young
persons detained under the ycja.
s.
148 (1)
of the cyfsa presumptively requires open detention for young persons
unless they fall within the criteria of
s. 148(2)
of the cyfsa.
secure detention is lawful if the young
person is charged with an offence punishable by 5 years or more as an adult and
the offence serious bodily harm to another, failed to appear, or in the
previous 12 months been convicted of an offence
punishable by more than 5 years if it were an adult proceeding. a youth
justice may review the decision to hold the young person in closed
custody.

s. 155
of the
cyfsa
authorizes
searches of an open or closed custodial facility for
young persons and the young persons held there, their property,
or a vehicle entering the
facility.
s.
155(2)
permits
the seizure of contraband,
which
is
defined
under s. 155(3) very broadly as anything the young person is not
authorized to have, is authorized to have but not in a place they are not
authorized to have it in, or use of something they are authorized to have but
for which they using it in an unauthorized
manner.

s.
344
(13)
of
the
cyfsa
permits
rules
about
the
search
of
young
persons
in custody.
those are found in
o reg 155/18.
sections 68 – 71 of o
reg 155/18 are:

emphasis
added

what is apparent is that o. reg.
155/18 says little specifically about strip searches of young persons. par.
68.4 contains an oblique reference:
4.
a
search that
could involve
physical
contact between the
staff
member
and
the person being searched or the removal
of some
or all clothes, other than outer garments,
of the person being
searched may only be performed on a young person and the following rules apply
to such searches:
emphasis
added

in those circumstances the search
must be done by two staff members, and the search must
be done by a same sex staff member unless there is some urgency.
beyond that the officer in charge of the detention facility must come up with
their own rules.
it is apparent on
the evidence of brennan goman that ministry policy 3.7 guided their craigwood
policy.
the craigwood policy forbade
complete nudity, which is consistent with policy 3.7, and required routine
strip searches upon entry to the facility by the young person.
other situations would trigger the routine
strip search as well: after unsupervised visits; and before transporting young
persons out of the facility if safety may be an issue.

what is also apparent is that
o/reg 155/18 and policy 3.7 permitted, and the craigwood search policy then
required, routine strip searching of young persons entering the facility
without any individualized suspicion or grounds.
i find that the craigwood routine search policy would have
required the strip searching of young persons to the point of partial nudity
upon entering woodview even if the staff had no concerns about the entry of
contraband into the facility.
it was
routine.

routine strip searches of inmates
in a detention facility has been litigated in the past.
in
r. v. rootenberg
2020 onsc 171, aff’d
2024 onca 493,
the accused, an
adult argued that
being routinely strip searched was a
charter
violation both upon entry
to the toronto south detention facility and then while moving within the jail.
this was argued as a s.8 violation under
the
charter.
justice allen did
not find a s. 8 violation. she found that it was not unreasonable for inmates
to be subjected to searches of their cells or their person.
as she put it “…safety and security
outweighs the interest in privacy and reduces an inmates expectation of
privacy” (supra at par. 116).
the
court of appeal found no error in this finding. they said that “these were
authorized strip searches conducted for the purpose of ensuring the safety of
people at the detention centre”(see
r. v.
rootenberg
2024
onca 493 at par. 8).
this reflects
the principle that correctional authorities are given deference to decide what
is reasonable care for the safety of inmates,
see
mission v. khela
2014
scc 24.

notably, allen j. distinguished
the landmark
case
r. v. golden
2001 scc 83. while that case does outline
a procedure for strip searching in order to comply with s. 8 of the
charter,
golden
distinguishes
between police strip searching upon arrest on one
hand and correctional institutional strip searches on the other.
golden
rules
on the former,
recognizing (at par. 96) that institutional strip searching involves different
considerations.
while the
court of appeal
did
not consider
that part
of her
analysis, ie the
distinguishing characteristics of
golden, her ruling was upheld.
i would therefore approach
golden
the
same way justice allen did.
it is
distinguishable, subject to my comments below about the invasiveness of strip
searching.

if the ratio of
rootenberg
applied
to this case, the applicant’s
charter
application would be dismissed.
i find, however that it
does not.
rootenberg
was an adult being held on straightforward charges in an adult facility.
jf and ss are youths.
as was seen above youth proceedings are
very different than adult proceedings.
i
find that s. 3(1)(b)(iii) of the ycja requires all justice system participants
to deliver enhanced procedural protections to young persons facing criminal proceedings,
including their
right to privacy.
that
provision
has been in place since
april 1,
2003, and
has remained intact.
parliament can expect this to be firmly
embedded in the minds of all justice system
participants.
simply
put,
the
privacy
enjoyed
by
youths
in
custody
is
greater
than that of adults.

in her recent decision
r. v.
s.m.
2024 oncj 656
henschel j. (then in the
ontario court) found that search and seizure provisions applying
to adults attract a different
balancing
exercise when
applied
to
youths.
in
s.m.
the
impugned
search
was
a penile swab incidental to arrest.
her honour said at par. 312,
the privacy interests engaged
where the youth is the subject of the search are greater than in cases
involving an adult.
the potential
impact of such an investigative technique on a young person is more profound
than in the case of an adult.
i agree, and would apply the
same reasoning to a strip search upon entry to a custodial
facility.

with that established i find it
troubling that youths entering custodial facilities would be subjected to
routine strip searching without any individualized basis to do so. that
happened in woodview, and it would appear other youth institutions as well.
ministry policy 3.7 effectively guided transfer payment recipients delivering
youth custody services by telling them that routine strip searches of youths
was a standard of service delivery. policy 3.7 spells that out clearly.
craigwood, and therefore its woodview
facility
surely
had an independent
obligation to come up
with
its own search policy by virtue of o/reg 155/18 par. 69(1), but that in-house
policy had to comply with par. 68.4 which minimally referred to strip searches.
policy 3.7 introduced the concept of
routine strip searches, and on the evidence before me craigwood brought its
policy into alignment with policy 3.7.
the
result is that routine strip searches of young persons was being done at
woodview.
jf and ss bore the burden
of that, as did every young person
entering
a detention facility.
this did not
reflect the enhanced privacy protections under the ycja. routinely strip
searching young persons without any individualized suspicion to ground the
search, as happened to both ss and jf
was
a violation of their rights under s. 8 of the
charter.

a reasonable suspicion standard,
in my
opinion, tends
to balance the valid safety and security
concerns applicable to detention facilities with the privacy rights of youths. in
this case it may not have been difficult to surmount the threshold for some of
the searches.
both jf and ss were
arrested because of their involvement in a fatal stabbing where the
murder weapon was
never recovered.
if
there
was no
evidence
that the police had eliminated the
possibility of either one possessing the murder weapon after arrest that may
well have furnished a valid basis to search both upon entering woodview for the
first time.
but once the detention
facility had no reasonable grounds to suspect that either one had contraband
the strip searching served no legitimate purpose.
therefore, to answer the second question from
r. v. collins
(supra)
the law requiring routine strip searches of jf and ss was unreasonable.

proceeding to whether the searches
of jf and ss were completed in a reasonable manner i find that
they were not.
policy
3.7 and the craigwood strip search policy both spell out that “the young person
must not be completely undressed for any period of time”.
the evidence is uncontradicted that that
happened on more than one occasion with jf and ss.
beyond the lack of individualized basis to conduct the strip
search, the strip searches of jf and ss involved at times complete nudity which
was unreasonable.
the evidence i
heard establishes that this happened because youths simply wanted to get the
procedure over with quickly, and covering up part of the body with the provided
towel simply extended the procedure.
be
that as it may, total nudity was prohibited, for good reason.
staff members were not at liberty to
simply disregard the search protocol at the request of the young person.

therefore in answer to the third
question from
r. v. collins
(supra) the searches were not conducted in a
reasonable manner.

to summarize thus far: the strip
searching of jf and ss violated s. 8 under the
charter
two ways.
the regulatory structure outlining the
engagement of strip searches required
strip
searches
on
a
routine
basis
without
regard
to
any
individualized
basis. on the evidence before me staff
members violated the craigwood search policy by permitting total nudity of the
searched youths, including jf and ss.
remedy

the applicants seek a stay of
proceedings under s. 24(1) of the
charter. discussion of this remedy
must begin with the strong language
used by the supreme court of canada in
r.
v. babos
2014 scc 16 (canlii),
 1 s.c.r. 309
at par.
30:
a stay of proceedings is the most drastic
remedy a criminal court can order (
r.
v.
regan,
2022 scc 12
), at para. 53). it
permanently halts the prosecution of an accused. in doing so, the truth-seeking
function of the trial is frustrated and the public is deprived of the
opportunity to see justice done on the merits. in many cases, alleged victims
of crime are deprived of their day in court.

for these reasons a stay of
proceedings is a remedy which is rarely granted.
only the clearest of cases should be stayed.
the high bar set for a judicial stay
reflects the idea that public confidence in the administration of justice is
most often served by
the completion
of a trial on its merits.

there are two general categories
of cases where a stay is appropriate: where state conduct compromises trial
fairness (the main category) and where there is no threat to trial fairness but
state conduct risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the
residual category).
if the impugned
state conduct does not engage the main category then it falls within the
residual one.

in this case there is no trial
remaining.
only imposition of
sentence remains in this proceeding. i
would
therefore consider the applicant’s claim to a stay of
proceedings under the residual category.

the
test
for
a
stay
has
three
components,
per
babos
(supra)
at
par.
32:
1)
there must be prejudice to the accused's right to a
fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that "will be
manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through
the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome" (
regan
at para.
54
);
2)
there
must
be
no
alternative
remedy
capable
of
redressing
the
prejudice;
and
3)
where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay
is warranted after steps 1) and 2), the court is required to balance the
interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and
preserving the integrity of the justice
system,
against "the interest that society has in having a final decision on the
merits" (
ibid., at para.
57).

trial fairness in part 1) of the
test asks whether the accused right to a fair trial was prejudiced and whether
that prejudice
will carry forward through
the conduct of the trial.
the first
part of the test examines the ongoing nature of the prejudice.

the residual category, when
invoked asks whether the state conduct is offensive to societal notions of fair
play and decency and whether proceeding with a trial in the face of that type
of conduct would be harmful to the justice system,
see
babos
(supra)
at paras 34 and 35.

i would pause at this point to
find that the language of
babos
contemplates a prospective trial.
in other words the
ratio
of
babos
speaks to an applicant who is an accused, with the presumption of
innocence.
this case is exceptional
to the extent that both jf and ss have been found guilty after entering guilty
pleas. this does not disentitle them to a stay of proceedings if they satisfy
the test for that remedy, but it cannot be ignored.

as part of the
process before me
both jf and ss admitted the offences in lengthy agreed
statements
of facts, and
did
so under oath.
what is therefore sought is not a stay of an impending trial but
of the imposition of sentence.
granting
a stay of proceedings will therefore have the effect of stopping all further
prosecution of two young persons who are guilty in fact and in law, and
otherwise awaiting the imposition
of
sentence.

the trial fairness limb of the
argument must consider the fact that the persons who strip searched both jf and
ss appeared in court on this application and testified about having done so.
this was because, having filed a
charter
application alleging
warrantless searches, the crown responded by calling evidence to justify the
searches. while the custodial witnesses mostly did not
cooperate with out of court interviews, that was not known at
the time. the
charter
applications therefore were the only reason
why the officers conducting the strip
searches appeared in court with jf and ss.

this case therefore is quite
distinguishable from
r. v. tran
2010 onca 471
where the police officers
who beat the appellant when he turned himself in appeared at the ultimate trial
and sat at counsel table with the crown.
the
presence of the officers who beat the appellant was one of the reasons the
court of appeal found that trial fairness was implicated when considering a
stay of proceedings.
the case at bar
is quite different, both as regards the level of state conduct, and secondly
the only reason for the presence of the various woodview officers was the
charter
application.
for these reasons
there is no trial fairness aspect of the stay of proceedings analysis. this
case must be analysed in the residual category of stay of proceedings.

in submissions i was told that
this was the first case to seek a stay of
proceedings
where the strip searching of youths in detention was considered.
i
consider
the evidence
that woodview has now
effectively closed and so there will be no strip searching there going forward.
i must ask at the initial stage of the
test whether
the state conduct is so
troublesome that proceeding to sentencing will leave the impression that the
justice system condones society’s sense of fair play and decency. this
is
admittedly
a
difficult
question
to
answer.
the
strip
searching
of
both
jf
and
ss
is
troubling, at least because it reflects a pattern of institutional conduct.
this tends to pull toward granting a stay.

the applicants’ claim to a stay of
proceedings really fails on the second and third
limbs.

there is an alternate remedy
available, namely a sentence reduction. the ycja mandates that time spent in
detention by the young person as a result of the offence shall be taken into
account, see ycja s. 38(3)(d).
there is no specific formula, and the conditions of
the youth’s pre-sentence custody may be included, see
r. v. d.s.
2008
onca 740. in related cases i took into consideration strip searches as part of
that analysis,
see
r. v. a.b.
(supra) at par. 43,
r. v. m.j.
(supra)
at par. 52(5).
i therefore find that
that there is
clear alternate remedy.

i also find that the strip searching had some effect
on the decision by sirivar j. to grant
both
applicants
bail, see
r.
v. jf
2023
oncj 180
at par. 94,
r. v. ss
2023 oncj 177
at pars 32 – 37, 82), the effect
of strip searching has already been judicially mitigated for both applicants to
some extent.
the decision to grant
bail was within weeks of the strip searching and therefore had some immediate
remedial effect.

beyond bail and a sentence
reduction the effect of a judicial pronouncement about the lawfulness of state
conduct is in and of itself an alternate remedy. this is the
prospective remedy which tends to mitigate systemic
charter
violations such as this,
see
r.
v. brown
2024 onca 453
at par.
80.
this
is the first such finding about the lawfulness of routine strip searching of youths.
it is expected that the ministry take this
into account in revisiting its search policy and regulations for young persons
in custody. in previous paragraphs i have offered a reasonable suspicion
standard for youth strip searches
in
custody,
but
it
is
ultimately
for
the
legislature
to
craft
appropriate
rules
which comply
with s. 8 of the
charter
and ycja s. 3(1)(b) in this context.

the applicant’s claim for a stay
also fails on the final ground, namely the balancing exercise. this
limb of the test takes on added importance in the
residual category of abuse of process cases.
the balancing exercise must consider: the nature and seriousness of the
impugned conduct; whether the conduct is isolated or systemic; the nature and
circumstances of the accused; the charges sought to be stayed; and the interest
in having the charges disposed of on their merits,
see
babos
(supra) at
par. 41.

with that in mind i would make the
following findings at the balancing phase of the test.
there is clear evidence that strip searching of youths happens
across the system of youth detention.
routine
strip searching of youths is of some seriousness because it fails to take into
the legal protections of youths when balancing the valid safety concerns of
having contraband in a detention facility. i would also find that the impact
of the strip searching of both jf and ss
was brief, even if it took place 7 times in the case of jf and 3 times for ss.

jf pleaded guilt to being an
active participant in the swarming of kenneth lee a homeless man.
she admitted
that her conduct made her guilty of manslaughter.
ss admitted to being a participant in that
swarming but only guilty of the lesser charges of assault with a weapon and
assault causing bodily harm.

from my involvement in the case i
find, rather easily, that
strip
searching jf and ss does not rise to the level where it would shock the
conscience of the community to the point where a stay of proceedings is
appropriate. rather, i find the opposite – it would shock the community to stay
the charges against jf and ss particularly where alternate remedies
are
available.
routine strip searching
of jf and
ss
was offensive, but
nowhere near the level where the court should stay the charges.

for
these
reasons
the
application
to
stay
the
charges
is
dismissed.

documented
in
the
young
person’s
daily
log
what
was
removed
and
the
reason.
□
visiting
area
–
searches
may
be
done
of
the
visiting
area
prior
to,
and
at
the
conclusion of, each visit. except when
circumstances warrant, visitors or their purses will not be searched since the
young person can be searched after the visit, if there is a concern.

this
is
a
hand
search
of
a
young
person’s
outer
clothing,
pockets, and carried
bags.

young
person’s
outer
clothing/bag
is handed to staff
to
search, and
the
young
person
is
asked
to
turn
their
pockets
inside
out.
this
is
conducted
when
there
is
suspicion
of possession
of
contraband
and
may
be
conducted
in
any
area
of
the building giving thought
to
privacy.

does
not
need
to
be
done
after
a
professional
visit unless
at
the
discretion
of
facility
staff
one
is
considered
necessary.

possible,
it
is
conducted
by
two
facility staff, one of whom
must
be
of
the

only conducted
by
a
facility
staff
of
the
same
gender under
the
observation
of
a
second
facility
staff. this search may be conducted at
facility staff’s discretion if there is a plausible suspicion of contraband,
and
a general clothing search is deemed
insufficient. both outer clothing and
frisk
searches
may
include
the
young
person
removing
footwear,
socks,
and
extra
clothing
to
allow
for
proper
inspection
of
those
items
while
the
young
person
remains
clothed.

facility
staff
who
conducted
the
search
must
report
the
search
to

must
be of the same sex as the young person.
when facility staff of the opposite sex is involved, they must position
themselves in such a manner that they can only observe the same sex facility
staff
as the young person as they carry out
the search. the young person will be given the opportunity to remove their own
clothing and must not be completely undressed for any period of time (e.g. the
young person is given a sheet while they are undressing so they are not left
standing
undressed
for
any
period
of
