overview

garry moore entered a guilty plea to the offence of producing
methamphetamine, a schedule i substance, between april 1 and august 2, 2023. the
crown seeks a 10-year penitentiary sentence. the defence says that a sentence
in the range of 4 to 5 years jail is appropriate. the parties agree on the ancillary
orders. these reasons explain why i impose a sentence of 5 years jail less
pre-sentence custody.
circumstances of the offence

mr. moore’s offence occurred within the context of
project odeon,
a joint forces investigation into a large-scale drug network operating in the
greater toronto and hamilton area. the network was directed by senior figures
and involved multiple clandestine laboratories producing fentanyl and
methamphetamine, as well as storage sites for chemicals and equipment. between july
28 and august 10, 2023, search warrants were executed at ten locations,
including 6800 sixteen road, smithville. the total evidence seized in the
project included approximately 18 kilograms of methamphetamine, 1.3 kilograms
of fentanyl, and other drugs, along with precursor chemicals and specialized
laboratory equipment.

between
april 1 and august 2, 2023, mr. moore
participated in the production of methamphetamine at a rural property located
at
6800
sixteen road, smithville,
which contained a residence
and several outbuildings. mr. moore lived in one of the outbuildings and was
regularly observed moving between the residence and the outbuildings carrying
buckets, jugs, gas canisters, and other items. he also changed clothing before
entering the outbuilding, which investigators believe was for personal
protection.

moore worked under the direction of an associate and played a
lower-to-middle level role in the hierarchy of the drug network. his activities
included assisting in transporting chemicals and equipment, including during a
trip on
july
11, 2023,
when mr. moore helped load and unload
laboratory equipment and chemicals from a u-haul truck at both the smithville
property
and 4057 bethesda road, whitchurch-stouffville,
a location
associated with fentanyl production. these items were used to set up and
maintain a clandestine laboratory for synthetic drug production.

on
august 2, 2023, investigators executed a
search warrant at the smithville property and arrested mr. moore. a
methamphetamine laboratory was found in one of the outbuildings, along with
precursors, chemicals, and specialized equipment. mr. moore admits that he
participated in producing methamphetamine at this location.
circumstances of the offender

mr. moore is 47 years old. he was raised in a stable two-parent
household in hamilton and describes his upbringing as generally positive. he
has no prior criminal record. mr. moore has two children: an adult son and a
ten-year-old daughter, with whom he has had no contact since his arrest. he is
described as a caring and involved father.

his employment history reflects a strong work ethic. he has worked
in labour-intensive roles such as painting, fruit picking, commercial
contracting, and has had positions at multiple automotive centres. his most
recent employment was at kubes steel in hamilton, for approximately two and a
half years, where he held various positions.

mr. moore provided the author of the pre-sentence report with a
list of potential career paths he wishes to pursue when released from custody. while
serving pre-sentence custody, he obtained his ontario secondary school diploma (june
27, 2024) and completed several rehabilitative courses.

mr. moore reports ongoing health issues consistent with
ménière’s disease, including vertigo and hearing loss,
which have affected his ability to work. these symptoms were under medical
investigation before his arrest. there is a family history of similar
conditions.

substance abuse was not identified as a contributing factor. mr.
moore denies any dependency on drugs or alcohol, though he used cannabis as a
sleep aid. at the time of the offence, he was unemployed, without prescribed
medication, and under financial strain. he asserts that he was functioning in
“survival mode” and was exploited by others. he acknowledges responsibility for
his actions, expresses genuine remorse, and states that he now understands the
seriousness of his conduct.

mr. moore has the support of his siblings; two brothers and a
sister. he has regular contact with his brother, roger moore, who provides him
with some financial assistance. collateral sources describe mr. moore as
non-criminally oriented, hardworking, and eager to please, a trait that appears
to have made him vulnerable to manipulation. he has demonstrated efforts toward
self-improvement and reintegration.
purpose and principles of sentencing

section 718
of the
criminal code
instructs that the fundamental
purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute to respect for
the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society. sentencing
judges strive to achieve this goal by imposing just sanctions that have one or
more of the following objectives: (a) denunciation of the unlawful conduct and
the harm done to victims or to the community that is caused by the unlawful
conduct; (b) specific deterrence of the offender and general deterrence of
other persons who might commit similar offences; (c) separation of offenders
from society, where necessary; (d) assistance in rehabilitating offenders; (e)
reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and (f) promoting a
sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm they have
caused to victims or to the community.

ultimately, the fundamental principle of sentencing, set out in
s. 718.1
of the
criminal code, is to impose a sanction that is
proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed and the degree of
responsibility of the offender: see
r. v. nasogaluak,
2010 scc 6, at para.
40.

individualization is central to the
proportionality assessment:
see
r. v. parranto,
2021 scc 46,
at para.
12.
as chief justice wagner wrote, at paragraph 12 of
parranto,
“[w]hereas the gravity of a particular offence may be relatively constant, each
offence is ‘committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique
profile’”.

in order to tailor a sentence to the specific circumstances of
both the offence and the offender, a sentencing judge may need to consider
collateral consequences. taking these consequences into account allows the
judge to impose a proportionate sentence by reflecting all relevant factors
connected to the offence and the individual being sentenced: see
r. v.
suter,
2018 scc 34, at para.
46.

there is no fixed formula for considering collateral
consequences. a
collateral consequence includes any
consequence arising from the commission of an offence, the conviction for an
offence, or the sentence imposed for an offence, that impacts the offender:
suter, at para.
47. the principle of proportionality governs every
sentencing decision. collateral consequences may be considered, but they cannot
justify reducing a sentence to the point where it no longer reflects the
seriousness of the offence or the offender’s moral blameworthiness:
suter,
at para.
56.

section 718.2(b) states that a sentence
should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar
offences committed in similar circumstances. this is known as the principle of
parity.

the principle of restraint is contained in
ss. 718.2
(d) and (e)
of the
criminal code
mandating that an offender should not be deprived of
liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances;
and all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in
the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the
community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to
the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.
aggravating and mitigating circumstances

section 718.2
(a) of the
criminal code
states that a
sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating
or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.
aggravating
circumstances

mr. moore participated in the production of methamphetamine at a clandestine
meth lab. methamphetamine is a dangerous drug that is highly addictive. chronic
abuse of methamphetamine can result in significant health consequences: see
r.
v. ngo,
2023 onsc 282, at para.
32. the police investigation revealed that
the individuals mr. moore was associating with were involved in large-scale commercial
drug trafficking.

when they searched the lab, the police located precursors,
chemicals, and specialized equipment used in the production of methamphetamine.
the production of methamphetamine creates specific and significant risks to the
community arising from the surreptitious use and disposal of dangerous
chemicals: see
ngo,
at para.
18.

it is an aggravating circumstance that mr. moore participated in a
commercial methamphetamine production enterprise which made a dangerous and
highly addictive drug available to consumers and contributed to the risks
associated with its production.
mitigating circumstances

mr. moore is 47 years old. he has no prior criminal record. he
entered a guilty plea which is an indication of his remorse and acceptance of
responsibility for the offence. his guilty plea has spared the judicial
resources which would have been required for his trial and has absolved the
crown of its obligation to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

numerous individuals were arrested as part of project odeon. the
crown separated accused persons into groups to manage the complexity of the
prosecutions. the crown acknowledges that mr. moore’s guilty plea has
significantly reduced the complexity of the trial for the lone accused person
remaining in his prosecution group.

in the period during which he committed the offence, mr, moore had
taken a leave of absence from his employment on the advice of his doctor. he
was experiencing dizziness and extreme vertigo, symptoms
commonly associated with ménière’s disease. this made it
unsafe for mr. moore to operate machinery and therefore he could not work. he
was receiving employment insurance benefits at the time of his arrest and was under
significant financial strain. it also affected him emotionally, causing him to
be depressed, because his inability to work affected his ability to support his
daughter.

collateral sources describe mr. moore as non-criminally
oriented and hardworking. his work history and the steps he has taken to obtain
his high school diploma and complete institutional programs suggest that mr.
moore’s involvement in the meth production lab was out of character.

mr. moore has positive rehabilitative prospects. he has accepted
responsibility for his offence and worked toward bettering himself while
incarcerated by advancing his education and participating in rehabilitative
programming. he has a strong desire to re-enter the workforce, has a proven
track record of employment in various fields, and has supportive family who can
assist him.
collateral consequence

mr. moore has been detained in custody since his arrest on august
2, 2023. although mr. moore has not been formally diagnosed with ménière’s
disease, his family physician had referred him for specialized testing in may
and june of 2023 because he was experiencing symptoms related to the condition
and his father was diagnosed with the condition.

defence counsel filed medical records which show that, during his
incarceration, mr. moore continued to experience the physical symptoms
associated to the condition which include
nausea, dizziness, memory
difficulties, brain fog, vertigo, and hearing issues. while in custody, mr.
moore was prescribed a medication that greatly relieved his symptoms and
allowed him to participate in daily activities including volunteering for work
in the institution.

in january of 2025, the detention centre was unable to obtain
this medication for mr. moore. the medical records confirm the interruption in
the availability of this medication. during his allocution to the court at the
conclusion of the sentencing hearing, mr. moore addressed me on this issue. according
to mr. moore, without the medication, he was bedridden for a 10-day period and
could not eat or drink. the effects of the interruption were severe.

mr. moore reports that during this same period, his father, who
has the same condition, continued to receive the medication. i am prepared to
find that because of the interruption in this medication during his
incarceration, mr. moore experienced physical effects which made his
pre-sentence custody more difficult. i am prepared to treat it as a collateral
consequence of his commission of the offence and his pre-sentence incarceration.
analysis

counsel for the crown and mr. moore provided authorities to
support their respective positions but agreed that there is a broad range of
sentence for producing methamphetamine. i have found the authorities discussed
below to be of most assistance in arriving at a proportionate sentence for mr.
moore.

in
r. v. dibenedetto,
2019 onca 496, the offender appealed
his convictions and sentence of 5 years jail for production of
methamphetamine, possession of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking
and possession of proceeds of crime. the offender was convicted after a judge
alone trial. the appeal from conviction was dismissed. the evidence linked the
offender to a rural property on which there was a barn that housed a meth lab.
in the offender’s residence, which was also searched pursuant to a warrant, the
police located evidence of the purchase of lab equipment and literature
explaining the steps necessary to produce methamphetamine, as well as $50,000
in cash.

on the sentence appeal, mr. dibenedetto
submitted that the trial judge failed to consider his rehabilitative prospects
and to properly apply the principle of restraint when determining the quantum
of sentence to impose on a first offender. the sentence appeal was dismissed.
the court of appeal in
dibenedetto
was not persuaded that the
trial judge’s reasons for sentence reflected an inadequate consideration of
rehabilitative prospects or the principle of restraint. in doing so, the court,
at paragraph 23, said:
the sentencing objectives that occupy positions of
prominence in cases involving commercial production of dangerous drugs are
denunciation and deterrence. to these objectives, rehabilitation must occupy a
position of lesser importance. the sentence imposed here falls well within the
range of appropriate sentencing dispositions for this mature,
commercially-motivated offender.

the offender in
r. v. ngo,
2023 onsc 282, was found guilty
of production of methamphetamine, possession of methamphetamine for the purpose
of trafficking and possession of proceeds of crime over $5000. the findings of
guilt were made after what justice roberts characterized as “a brief and
efficient trial”. the offender was sentenced to 7 years in the penitentiary.

the methamphetamine lab in
ngo
contained a kilogram of
finished methamphetamine when the search warrant was executed. this was a
large-scale operation, involving the coordinated efforts of numerous people,
over at least a month. the offender, along with others, was regularly seen
inside the lab for hours at a time on a covert camera installed by police. the
court noted that mr. ngo and others were in the lab on average nine hours a day
on eleven days over the twelve-day period leading up to the search. mr. ngo was
usually the last one out of the lab, locking the door for the night. the lab
produced significant quantities of methamphetamine.

when police searched mr. ngo’s home, they found flasks similar to
those found in the lab and used in the production of methamphetamine, and other
containers consistent in size, colour and shape to containers found at the address
of the meth lab. police also seized $11,000 in cash from mr. ngo’s home.

on the date of sentencing, mr. ngo was 46 years old and had a
dated but unrelated criminal record. at trial, he denied his involvement in
the production of, or presence of, methamphetamine at the address where the lab
was located. he claimed that he had a renovation company and his only purpose
for being at that address was to renovate a bathroom. justice roberts rejected
his explanation. the court was given no further information about his
occupation or work history for purposes of sentencing.

at paragraph 18 of
ngo, justice roberts discussed the
range of sentence for production of methamphetamine:
the range of sentence for producing methamphetamine in
a clandestine lab is broad, spanning about 5 to 16 years. the offence has been
likened to importing. as justice clark explained, for both importing and production,
the accused is “the principal means by which the drug becomes available to the
canadian consumer”:
r. v. chui,
2015 onsc 2490, at para.
50; see also
r.
v. ling,
2012 onsc 654, sentence upheld
2014 onca 808; and
r. v. chen,
2019 oncj 385, at para.
24. the production of methamphetamine also imposes
specific and significant risks on the community arising from the surreptitious
use and disposal of dangerous chemicals. case law from ontario is summarized in
a sentencing chart at appendix a. in addition to the now-repealed statutory
aggravating factors set out above, factors relevant to situating a case within
the range include:
• the size, scale,
sophistication, and location of the laboratory;
• the duration of production;
• the role of the accused;
• the amount and value of
methamphetamine produced and found;
• whether the motive is
profit or addiction;
• potential harm to the
surrounding community, including presence of explosive, flammable, reactive and
toxic chemicals, toxic waste produced by production, associated environmental
damage, and the presence of armed and dangerous criminals associated with the
trade in illegal drugs;
• the harmful nature of
methamphetamine, including the fact that it is highly addictive, the serious
risk it poses to a user’s health (including brain and/or heart damage), and its
potential for inducing aggression and violence:
r. v. cote,
2002 bcca
29, at para.
10.

justice roberts found that mr. ngo played a significant role in
the production of methamphetamine at the organized, large scale methamphetamine
lab, although crown counsel acknowledged that she could not prove the precise
role he played.

in
ngo,
justice roberts emphasized that methamphetamine is
an extremely dangerous and highly addictive drug, causing severe physical and
psychological harm, and its production poses significant risks of fire, toxic
waste, and community danger. courts, including the supreme court of canada,
have long recognized the devastating impact of hard drugs on individuals,
families, and society, as well as the violence and hazards linked to
trafficking and clandestine labs. given this “staggering” harm, the principles
of general deterrence and denunciation must dominate sentencing for importation
and production, with appellate courts warning that those who engage in such
conduct should expect severe penalties to discourage participation in the drug
trade.

in
r. v. nguyen,
2011 onsc 6229, the offender entered
guilty pleas to producing methamphetamine and arson by negligence. the offender
operated a clandestine methamphetamine lab in a residential home. a fire broke
out while he was boiling methanol, causing severe burns to 70% of his body and
requiring five weeks of hospitalization. the lab contained compressed gas
cylinders and hazardous chemicals, creating a real risk of explosion that could
have destroyed multiple homes. finished methamphetamine valued at $249,000 was
found; the lab’s potential yield was estimated at $3.5 million. approximately
200 kg of toxic waste would have been disposed of in the community.

mr. nguyen was 20 years old at the time of the offences and had
no criminal record. at the time of sentencing, he was 23 years old. he
expressed his remorse and accepted responsibility for his decision to
participate in the lab in the hopes of making quick money. he was not the
controlling mind of the operation, but he was in control of the operation,
nonetheless. justice mcwatt sentenced mr. nguyen to serve 5 years in jail for
producing methamphetamine and 2 years jail for the arson by negligence to be
served concurrently.

in
r. v pham,
2016 onsc 7943, the offender, a 40-year-old
father of three, was convicted after a trial of producing methamphetamine and
possessing it for the purpose of trafficking. the police discovered a makeshift
lab containing chemical precursors, equipment, and 522.94 grams of finished
methamphetamine. the court applied the sentencing principles under s. 10 of the
controlled drugs and substances act
and
s. 718
of the
criminal code,
emphasizing denunciation, deterrence, proportionality, and parity. aggravating
factors included the significant quantity and value of methamphetamine, its
highly addictive and harmful nature, the commercial motive, the offender’s
high-level role in the production chain, and the chemical fire that posed
serious risks to persons and property. mitigating factors were the offender’s
limited criminal record, steady employment, family support, and compliance with
stringent bail conditions, including house arrest. while prospects for
rehabilitation were considered good, the court found that deterrence and
denunciation required a substantial custodial term. the offender was sentenced
to 4.5 years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.

i find that a sentence of 5 years jail is appropriate in mr.
moore’s case. the agreed statement of facts filed as exhibit 1 does not include
details about the size, scale and sophistication of the meth lab that police
located at the smithville property, nor did it contain details about the
duration of production, or the amount and value of methamphetamine found or
produced at the lab. mr. moore’s role was described as lower to middle level in
the hierarchy of this drug network. the agreed statement of facts says that he
was generally following instructions and directions from his associate at the
smithville property.

mr. moore’s guilty plea and genuine expression of remorse are
mitigating factors which are absent in the cases of
dibenedetto,
ngo,
and
pham.
mr. moore’s rehabilitative prospects are comparable to the
offender in
pham
and better than those of the offender in
ngo. mr.
moore’s involvement in a large-scale commercial drug trafficking network
requires a denunciatory and deterrent sentence but the mitigating circumstances,
and the collateral consequence mr. moore experienced while incarcerated due to
an interruption in his prescription medication, make a sentence at the lower
end of the range a proportionate sentence in the circumstances. it prioritizes
denunciation and deterrence and gives proper weight to the principles of
restraint and rehabilitation.
the sentence

i impose a 5-year jail sentence for production of
methamphetamine, contrary to s. 7(1) of the
controlled drugs and substances
act. mr. moore has served 834 days of pre-sentence custody, which is
equivalent to 1,251 days when enhanced at the
summers
rate of 1.5 to 1.
mr. moore has 574 days jail left to serve. since the remaining term of
imprisonment is within the provincial reformatory range, i find that a period
of probation of 2 years following mr. moore’s incarceration will assist him
with his rehabilitation.

in terms of ancillary orders, i require mr. moore to provide a sample
of his dna and, pursuant to
s. 109
of the
criminal
code, i prohibit
him from possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited
weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition for life, and any other
firearm or any cross-bow, restricted weapon, firearm part, ammunition and
explosive substance for 10 years. i make the forfeiture order which has been filed
on consent by the parties. i waive the victim surcharge as i find that it would
cause undue hardship to mr. moore.
