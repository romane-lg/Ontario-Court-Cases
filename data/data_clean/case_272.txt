introduction

ms.
deeva
john
entered
guilty
pleas
before
me
on
march
30,
2025,
acknowledging her
guilt
in
relation
to
six
charges
arising
from
incidents
on
four
separate
dates,
as
follows:
•
assault (june
19,
2024);
•
assault (july
23,
2024);
•
assault
causing
bodily
harm
and
fail
to
comply
with
probation
(august
11,
2024);
and,
•
assault
and
fail
to
comply
with
probation
(february
3,
2025).

ms. john entered those guilty
pleas knowing that the crown would bring an application
for
an
assessment
to
determine
whether
she
was
criminally
responsible
at
the
time of those offences. the crown’s application was heard on april 28, 2025 and
dismissed with reasons to follow. these
are my reasons.
ii.
the
applicable
law

section 672.11(b)
gives
the court authority
to order
an assessment
of the mental condition of an
accused where it has
“reasonable
grounds
to believe that such
evidence is
necessary
to
determine”
whether
the
accused
was
not
criminally
responsible
at
the
time
they committed the offences.

when
it
is
the
prosecutor
who
is
applying
for
the
assessment
and
the
accused
has not
put
their
capacity
into
issue,
as
is
the
case
here,
section
672.12
puts
further
conditions into place. section
672.12(3)(b) provides that the prosecutor must satisfy the court that there
are
“reasonable
grounds
to
doubt”
that
the
accused
is
criminally
responsible
for
the alleged
offence on account of mental disorder.

there must be both
reasonable grounds to believe that the person was suffering from a mental
disorder and reasonable grounds to doubt criminal responsibility on account of
mental disorder at the time of the allegations.

the evidence of a
mental disorder must be framed within the elements of the section 16 test: that
is, does the evidence of a mental disorder raise a doubt with respect to
whether the accused was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his
or her conduct or knowing that it was wrong.


the
“reasonable
grounds
to
doubt”
standard,
like
“reasonable
grounds
to
believe” provides
for
a
lower
standard
than
proof
on
a
balance
of
probabilities.

while
no
particular
evidence is necessary, the basis for the belief must “clearly and plainly
appear on the
record.”

iii.
analysis

there is no issue that
ms. john suffers from a mental disorder.
ms. john was the subject of a mental health act assessment in may 2023, which
concluded that, while there was no clear evidence of major mental illness, ms.
john’s “problems are best characterized as cluster b personality disorder
traits.” the assessment notes the
following:
cluster
b
personality
disorders
are
group
of
disorders
characterized
by
patterns
of unstable and dramatic behaviour,
emotional dysregulation, and impaired interpersonal
relationships.
the
four
main
types
of
cluster
b
personality
disorders with the diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5) are as
follows:
1.
antisocial personality disorder
(aspd): individuals with aspd exhibit a disregard
for
the
rights
of
others,
lack
empathy
and
engage
in
impulsive
and often criminal behaviour.
2.
borderline personality disorder
(bpd): individuals with bpd experience intense emotional instability, have
difficulty regulating their emotions, and display
impulsive
behaviours,
self-harm
tendencies,
and
unstable
self-image.
3.
narcissistic
personality
disorder
(npd):
individuals
with
npd
have
an
inflated sense of self-importance, a
constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. they often seek
attention and exhibit grandiose
behaviours.
4.
histrionic personality disorder
(hpd): those with hpd exhibit excessive attention-seeking
behaviours,
dramatic
emotions,
and
a
need
to
be
the
center of attention. they may engage in
self-dramatization and seek reassurance from others.

as noted, however, the burden on
the crown is to satisfy the court that there are reasonable grounds to doubt
that ms. john either lacked the capacity to appreciate the nature and quality
of her conduct or know that it was wrong. it is on that basis that the crown’s
application
fails as
there is
nothing, in
my view, in
the
facts
of
these
offences that calls into question that fundamental issue of capacity under
either branch of the s. 16 test.

in relation to the june 20
incident, the crown led evidence that the victim was delivering
a
package
when
he
encountered
ms.
john
who
demanded
that
he
be
her
uber driver. when he refused, she punched
and kicked him while insisting that he drive her. as noted by the defence,
however, this is not random, inexplicable conduct. rather, ms john saw someone
doing delivery driving, decided they would drive her, and when they refused,
assaulted them. her conduct is a direct response to a situation in which her
demands
are
not
being
met.
while
her
response
is
demonstrative
of
a
complete
disregard for the rights of others, this is entirely in keeping her
personality disorder diagnosis.

in my view, the july 23 and august
11, 2024, incidents are similar in nature. in relation to the july 23, 2024,
incident, ms. john was unhappy because she was denied entry onto a ttc bus and
pushed a barrier shield towards the bus driver. in relation to the august 11,
2024, incident, ms. john was unhappy with another customer at a store because
she
believed
that
person
had
skipped
the
line.
she
followed
the
customer
out
of
the store where she then assaulted them and fled on foot.

the crown initially relied on
these incidents in support of their application for an assessment but
subsequently chose not to rely on them. i agree with their assessment. the
facts
in
those
cases
–
much
like
the
facts
above
–
are
incidents
in
which
ms.
john
is responding to a situation in which she
feels she was wronged. they provide no basis to doubt ms. john’s capacity under
either branch of s. 16.

the final incident on february 3,
2025, is similar in nature. the crown played extensive video capturing this
incident and its
aftermath. the
video amply
demonstrates that ms.
john is again directly responding to a situation in which her demands are not
being
met.
ms.
john
is
captured
repeatedly
telling
the
driver
to
“close
the
doors”
and
“go”
while
also
yelling
“take
another
bus”
to
the
wheelchaired
passenger
waiting
to
board
the
bus.
when
ms.
john’s
demands
are
not
complied
with,
she
becomes
more
frustrated
and spat
in
the
direction
of
the
passenger
and
banged
on
the
plexiglass
protecting
the
driver.

when
ms.
john
is
confronted
by
the
police,
she
understands
that
she
is
in
jeopardy and engages in discussions with
the police where she tries to minimize her conduct.

in my view, the video relied upon
by the crown is evidence detracting from their application, not enhancing it.
it demonstrates that ms. john knew exactly what she was doing and that she knew
it was wrong.

the
crown
filed
additional
materials
in
support
of
their
assessment
application
that
included the following:
an affidavit from police
constable james folkes attesting that ms. john has 429 reports on file, as
follows:
•
83
other
provincial
statutes;
•
45
trespassing;
•
16
assaults;
•
6
assaults
with
a
weapon;
•
10
fail
to
comply
with
court
orders;
•
15
mha
apprehensions;
•
5
non-
mha
apprehensions;
•
5
mischief
charges;
and,
•
4
general
incidents.
•
sentencing
proceedings
on
november
21,
2023
•
sentencing
proceedings
before
justice
downes
on
june
5,
2024
•
mental
health
occurrence
reports
from
may
2023
to
january
23,
2025

much of this information,
including ms. john’s legal history and medical history, was
either
reviewed
by
the
assessor
for
the
may,
2023
report
or
is
similar
in
nature.
those prior occurrences were relied on by the assessor to conclude:
[ms. john’s]
patterns of behaviour over the last year have been characterized by impulsivity
and emotional dysregulation. she has demonstrated occasions when she has been
quick to anger, and demonstrated lack of judgment, including pursuing
her
own
aims
and
intentions,
without
regard
to
rules
of
social
convention.

in other words, these prior
occurrences do not raise an issue with respect to ms. john’s capacity under
either branch of the s. 16 test. i further agree with the defence submission
that sentencing decisions and occurrence reports do not assist the crown because
they shed no light on ms. john’s state of mind at the time she committed the
offences
on
june
19,
2024,
and
february
3,
2025
which
is
the
issue
before
the
court.

while
i
accept
that
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
ms.
john
suffered
from a mental disorder at the time she committed these offences, there is no
basis to doubt that her disorder rendered her incapable of appreciating the
nature and quality of her conduct or knowing that it was wrong.

the
crown’s
application
is
dismissed.
