a.r. mackay j.:
ruling on s.
11(b) application
introduction

the applicant alleges her right to a trial within a reasonable
time has been breached and request a stay pursuant to ss. 11(b) and 24(2) of
the
charter.
ms. lindo is charged with impaired operation, possession
of a controlled substance and fail to provide a breath sample, contrary to
ss. 320.14(1)
(a),
320.15(1)
and
4(1)
of the
criminal
code of canada
(the “
code
”) and
control drugs and substances act
(“
cdsa
”), respectively.

the chronology of events is laid out in the parties’ materials. for ease
of reference, i refer to the crown’s chart setting out a summary of the
proceedings.

it is attached as appendix a.

section 11(b) of the
charter
guarantees that any person charged
with an offence has the right “to be tried within a reasonable time.” in
r.
v. jordan,
the supreme court identified a presumptive ceiling of 18 months for trials
to be completed in the ontario court of justice.

the
jordan
framework for s. 11(
b
) can be summarized as
follows:
there is a ceiling beyond
which delay becomes presumptively unreasonable. the presumptive ceiling is 18
months for cases tried in the provincial court, and 30 months for cases in the
superior court (or cases tried in the provincial court after a preliminary
inquiry). defence delay does not count towards the presumptive ceiling.
once the presumptive ceiling
is exceeded, the burden shifts to the crown to rebut the presumption of
unreasonableness on the basis of exceptional circumstances. exceptional
circumstances lie outside the crown’s control in that (1) they are reasonably
unforeseen or reasonably unavoidable, and (2) they cannot reasonably be
remedied. if the exceptional circumstance relates to a discrete event, the
delay reasonably attributable to that event is subtracted. if the exceptional
circumstance arises from the case’s complexity, the delay is reasonable.
below the presumptive
ceiling, in clear cases, the defence may show that the delay is unreasonable.
to do so, the defence must establish two things: (1) it took meaningful steps
that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings; and (2) the
case took markedly longer than it reasonably should have.
for cases currently in the system,
the framework must be applied flexibly and contextually, with due sensitivity
to the parties’ reliance on the previous state of the law.
the total delay

the period of delay in this case is from january
12, 2023 (the date the information was sworn) until january 23, 2025 (the
applicant’s last trial date), which is 742 days or approximately 24 months and
11 days. the applicant concedes 83 days or 2 months and 22 days of defence
delay, which brings the net delay to 659 days or 21 months and 21 days.

the first step in determining whether the delay
is unreasonable is to determine whether there is any defence delay. the
following are four time periods in which the respondent alleges are the
responsibility of the applicant. i will now turn to each of those time
periods.
wrong email

there was some delay due to the crown recording
an incorrect email for counsel and as a result, notification of disclosure was
not received. however, while this is true, the crown did attempt to confirm
counsel’s email at the following set date, but agent for counsel did not
correct the crown with respect to the correct email. it took the defence 57
days, from june 23, 2023, until august 18, 2023, to provide the correct email
to the crown. i will apportion the 57 days as defence
delay. while the delay was inadvertent, it cannot be categorized as crown or
systemic delay.
delay in scheduling a trial scheduling
conference

the defence conceded that there was some delay
in setting a trial scheduling conference after the crown pre-trial (cpt). it
is mr. parkin’s submission that half of this time period can be considered
defence delay. the crown pre-trial (cp) was held on
october 27, 2023 however, the defence did not book a trial scheduling
conference until february 16, 2024. this is a significant delay of 101 days. 
it likely was in part because defence was waiting for the cell video. however,
they did not advise the crown that they could not set a trial date without
it. once they received the trial estimate sheet on october 27, they emailed
the trial coordinator’s office (tc), these were the instructions provided in
the email. however, the crown advised, and mr. parkin did not contest the
following: once you email the brampton tc’s office, an automated ‘bounce
back’ email will inform counsel to go through the app to schedule a date with
the tc’s office. mr. parkin’s office emailed the tc’s office on december 15,
2023. it is likely that they received a message that they had to go through
the scheduling app. counsel eventually pursued the route set out in the automated
email and ultimately scheduled the trial scheduling conference for february 26,
2023. i would allow defence two weeks to digest the discussions with the crown
and to get instructions from their client, and i would allow a further week to
sort out the miscommunication about how to set a date. defence delay would
therefore be 80 days.
delay in bringing an 11(b) application

once the trial date was set, an 11(b)
application was not filed until august 12, 2024, 5 months and 13 days after the
trial date was set (169 days). the recent case law has held that where
defence counsel waits to file an 11(b) and do not advise the crown and the
court early in the proceedings, that they should then be responsible for part
of this time period. the reasoning being that had they brought their 11(b)
application sooner or set a date for an 11(b) at the time they set the trial
date, the crown would have had the opportunity to take steps to mitigate delay.

in this case i am of the view that it is
reasonable to allow the defence two weeks to consider whether they would bring
an 11(b) application. mr. parkin did meet with the crown on april 9, 2024,
and advised the crown that they would be bringing an 11(b) application,
however, there was no follow up for over 5 months by either party.

given the caseload the brampton crowns are
dealing with, it is reasonable to assume their office will focus on those cases
where in fact 11(b) applications have been brought. still, i would grant the
defence a further two weeks to await to hear from the crown: 4 ½ months remain
of the delay in bringing an 11(b) application. both parties are at fault,
therefore i would deduct as defence delay, 2 months and
15 days or 75 days.
applicant not available for trial dates
offered

defence counsel fairly acknowledged that 83
days should be deducted as defence delay as counsel was not available for trial
when the court and the crown were on october 31, 2024, and november 1, 2024.
deducting the total defence delay of 295 days from the total delay of 742
leaves a net delay of 447 days or 14.7 months. this is just under the
jordan
presumptive ceiling.
delay under presumptive ceiling

when
the remaining delay falls below the presumptive ceiling, the onus is on the
defence to show that the delay is unreasonable:

the
defence must establish two things to support a claim that the delay below the
ceiling is unreasonable: (1) it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a
sustained effort to expedite the proceedings;
and
(2) the case took
markedly longer than it reasonably should have. judicial stays beneath the
ceiling are rare and will only be granted in “clear cases”.
where the defence has not established both requirements, the s. 11(b)
application must fail.


the
supreme court in
jordan
provided the following instruction regarding
defence counsel’s obligation, at para. 85:
to satisfy this criterion, it
is not enough for the defence to make token efforts such as to simply put on
the record that it wanted an earlier trial date. since the defence benefits
from a strong presumption in favour of a stay once the ceiling is exceeded, it
is incumbent on the defence, in order to justify a stay below the ceiling, to
demonstrate having taken meaningful and sustained steps to be tried quickly.
while the defence might not be able to resolve the crown's or the trial court's
challenges, it falls to the defence to show that it attempted to set the
earliest possible hearing dates, was
cooperative
with and responsive to
the crown and the court, put the crown on timely notice when delay was becoming
a problem, and conducted all applications (including the s. 11(b) application)
reasonably and expeditiously. at the same time, trial judges should not take
this opportunity, with the benefit of hindsight, to question every decision
made by the defence. the defence is required to act reasonably, not perfectly.

i
find that the defence did, at times show an interest in moving the case along,
however, they did not do so consistently. counsel did send a letter to the
crown requesting an earlier trial date and counsel parkin had a crown pre-trial
where he advised he wanted to mitigate delay. while the defence did proceed to
setting a trial date despite not having the cells video, they took over two
months to schedule a trial scheduling conference date to set a trial date. in
addition, they did not bring an 11(b) application for close to 5 months after
the trial dates were set. further, counsel did not take advantage of the
backlog reduction court initiative. commencing on april 18, 2023, acting
regional senior justice leitch disseminated an invitation to the criminal bar,
to participate in the backlog reduction court whereby earlier trial dates could
be obtained. on november 1, 2023, this court issued a practice direction on
section 11(b) applications requiring that 11(b) motions be scheduled at the
same time the trial dates are set. in conclusion, looking at the defence
action throughout i cannot find that they took meaningful and sustained efforts
to ensure the trial was conducted in a reasonable time.
markedly longer

as
the applicant has failed to establish this first condition, i am not required
to consider whether the case took markedly longer than it should have. however,
i will review this issue briefly. this second criterion involves
consideration of such factors as case complexity, local considerations, and
whether the crown took reasonable steps to expediate the proceedings. the case
was not complex, given the backlog from covid-19 back in 2023, this time frame
for a two-day trial was not out of the ordinary.

the
crown could have taken further steps to expediate the proceedings once they
were alerted by defence. on april 8, 2024, counsel worsoff emailed the “virtual
crown” indicating an interest in obtaining earlier trial dates. it should be
noted that the ‘virtual crown” is manned by the administrative staff who mostly
manage disclosure. i am of the view that such an email represents more of a
“token effort”. counsel parkin attended a cpt on april 9, 2024, and advised
that ms. lindo wanted an earlier trial date. despite these communications, no
crown responded to their request. however, the procedure to seek earlier dates
was to schedule another trial scheduling conference. the most effective way to
get the crown’s attention would be to schedule and file an 11(b) application.

i
find that in all the circumstances, that 15 months for a 2-day trial in
brampton while not ideal, was not markedly longer in all the circumstances. 
in the result, the application to stay the charges for unreasonable delay
pursuant to s. 11(b) of the
charter
is dismissed.
