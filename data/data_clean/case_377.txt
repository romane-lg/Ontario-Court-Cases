overview
of
the
case

the
defendant
is
charged
with
criminally
harassing
douglas
letsche,
by
repeated
direct and indirect communications between may 2, 2022, and march 26, 2024,
causing letsche to reasonably fear for his safety.

the crown elected
summarily, and a contested trial was held where mr. lochner represented
himself.
the
crown
called
one
viva
voce
witness,
mr.
letsche.
the
defence
elected to call none.

after considering the evidence as
a whole, and the submissions of the defendant and
crown,
i
found
the
crown’s
case
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
lochner
must be found guilty of the sole count of
criminal harassment.
overview
of
the
facts

douglas letsche is a police
officer with the toronto police service (tps). for years,
he
worked
with
the
emergency
task
force
(etf).
before
this
trial,
he
had
not
met
mr. lochner in person. but mr. lochner has been emailing him for years.

mr.
lochner
undisputedly
sent
numerous
emails,
both
directly
and
indirectly,
to
pc
letsche. he also sent three emails, in march 2024, to pc letsche’s
brother-in-law.

the defendant’s emails all pertain
to events from almost eighteen years ago. in august
2006,
the
etf
executed
a
feeney
warrant
to
arrest
mr.
lochner.
while
executing
that warrant, the officers repeatedly tasered mr. lochner’s disabled brother.

for almost two decades, mr.
lochner has pursued his belief that a police and government cover-up exists in
relation to this event. for years, he has been emailing police officers,
supervisors, freedom of information officials, other government officials,
lawyers, and judges to either accuse them of participating in a cover-up or to
seek help in exposing one.

it was in this context that mr.
lochner started emailing pc letsche. pc letsche was a member of the etf team
that executed the
feeney
warrant to arrest him. but letsche
was
not
there
on
that
day.
he
had
injured
himself,
earlier
in
the
day,
and
was
not present when the warrant was
executed.

right
up
to
his
trial,
mr.
lochner
has
believed
cst.
letsche
to
be
part
of
the
alleged
cover-up of the tasering of his brother.
content
of
the
emails

this court was provided with 89
emails sent by mr. lochner. all were sent either directly
or
indirectly
to
pc
letsche.
most
of
them
included
pc
letsche
as
a
“cc”
recipient,
along
with
a
long
list
of
other
people.
these
included
etf
officers
involved
in
the
tasering incident, their supervisors, government officials, the
premier, one of his ministers, the mayor, court operation officials, lawyers,
and judges.

many of the emails mentioned pc
letsche by name, in reference to the tasering event
and
his
belief
in
a
cover-up.
but
not
one
of
these
emails
contained
any
overt
threat.
every
email
advanced
the
topics
of
his
brother’s
tasering,
the
unclear
identity
of
all
officers who deployed tasers on his brother’s body, and mr.
lochner’s belief in a cover-up.

in other words, the content of
most of these emails was relatively innocuous. clearly mr. lochner believed
there was a government conspiracy and that his emails would
somehow
expose
that
cover-up.
he
often
emailed
multiple
times
per
day,
although there were some significant
temporal breaks in these communications.

while the evidentiary record in
mr. lochner’s case established emails sent between
2022
and
2024,
pc
letsche
testified
to
receiving
mr.
lochner’s
emails
since 2006. he streamed them into his junk mail folder. at some point,
he spoke with a supervisor
about
it
and
was
told
to
ignore
them. letsche
felt
his
complaint
was
not
taken seriously, but he did as he was directed.

the emails stopped at some unknown
point but began again in spring 2022. pc letsche sent
the
first few “up
the
chain”
and
continued
to stream them into
his
junk
mail. he would periodically check to see
if mr. lochner had said anything of concern.

on
april
30,
2022,
mr.
lochner
emailed
him amongst
many
other
recipients:
the etf tasered
my
autistic brother with three different m26 tasers and then conspired to claim
they only deployed two
tasers.
the paramedics who treated george
noted in their ambulance call report that the etf tasered george three times, 6
darts.
therefore, the crown attorneys
who have been protecting the police should resign
immediately,
and
the
criminal
etf
officers
must
be
arrested.
as per sgt. mark armstrong’s
#1107 sworn deposition his team
5
consisted
of
the
following
etf
officers
on
august
11,
2006:
1.
pc
domenic
bruzzese;
2.
pc
david
bragg;
3.
pc
stephen
carmichael;
4.
pc
william
shikatani;
and
5.
gissa
waters.
there were only two other
personnel on duty, station operations pc lesa harvey and pc doug letsche.
however, letsche
was injured during a bed-race on the danforth and went home to cry.
in
2006
all
the
m26
tasers
were
assigned
to
the etf – no one else.
therefore,
taser
m26-19421,
which
was
assigned
to
the
etf in 2006, could only have been deployed either by
•
pc
david
bragg;
or
•
pc
william
shikatani
pc
domenic bruzzese deployed taser m26-03496;
pc
stephen
carmichael
deployed
taser
m26-15704;
pc
gissa
waters
remained
outside
the
lochner
residence and did not deploy a taser;
sgt.
mark
armstrong
was
not
carrying
a
taser.

this email ended with cut and
paste information, apparently from the ontario sunshine
list,
about
the
salaries
of
csts.
letsche
and
harvey.
portions
of
this
email
were
subsequently cut and pasted into other communications.

this
was
the
email
that
officer
letsche,
upon
its
receipt,
forwarded
“up
the
chain” in case a response of some kind
was required. he received a similar email the next day and forwarded that one
too.

by early june 2022, mr. lochner
began emailing pc letsche directly, while continuing
to
“cc”
other
police
officers
and
justice
system
participants.
the
tenor
of
these
emails
was
the
same:
alleging
a
conspiracy
to
cover
up
use
of
a
third
taser
on
his
brother.
some
were
more
specific
–
for
example,
demands
for
the
memobook
notes
of
pc
harvey
became an incessant theme.

some were directed at pc letsche
himself, albeit in an innocuous manner at the start. for example, on one
occasion mr. lochner wrote:
hello
pc doug letsche
training
constable
–
etf
300
lesmill rd.
toronto,
ontario
i trust you
remember back in 2006 when you were a swat operator,
you
injured
yourself
on
august
11
th
in
a
bed
race
on
the danforth, and therefore you had to take the day off.
the
remaining
swat
operators
that
afternoon
at
300
lesmill rd were as follows:
1.
sgt.
mark
armstrong;
2.
pc
dominic
bruzzese;
3.
pc
david
bragg;
4.
pc
stephen
carmichael;
5.
pc
william
shikatani;
6.
pc
gissa
waters-
ruocco;
7.
pc
lesa
harvey
the first six swat operators were
assigned to team 5, who later
that
afternoon
executed
a
feeney
warrant
at
the
lochner
residence.
***

who
is
the
only
remaining
‘swat
operator”
who had access to
taser 19421 on august 11, 2006?
the
answer
is
swat
operator
pc
lesa
harvey.
therefore, as the training
constable with swat
(“etf”),
why
would
pc
harvey
deploy
taser
m26-19421 four times at etf headquarters on august 6 2006 as she was there by
herself, as the “station operator”?

mr. lochner later concluded the
etf was falsely attributing non-operational deployment of this taser on pc
letsche. he alleged a wide-ranging conspiracy around not disclosing pc
letsche’s notes and emailed many government and court officials to assert a
cover-up. again, many of these emails were cut-and-paste documents taken from
other emails he had sent. on september 7, 2023, he said:
….even you will agree that if
taser m26-19421 was not deployed by a member of etf team 5, then it could only
have been deployed by pc douglas letsche, the remaining etf officer.
therefore,
why
did
paul
mcgee
of
the
toronto police service indicate on
september 10, 2020 that it was not logical to search for the memorandum book
notes of all etf officers working
the
afernoon
shift
of
august
11,
2006?
is it because the memorandum book
entries of pc douglas letsche will confirm that he did not deploy taser
m26-19421 on august 11, 2006?
***
therefore,
as
police
use
of
force
is
governed through
regulation
926
of
the
police
services
act, we shall see if the office of the independent police review director take
my recently filed complaint seriously, and ask the toronto police to procuce
(sic) pc douglas
letsche’s
memorandum
book
entries
from
august
11,
2006,
or
if
the
oiprd
will
sweep my compaint (sic) under the carpet.

pc letsche acknowledged that this
type of email was concerning, but not frightening. but he was concerned about
the persistence of mr. lochner’s focus on an incident from seventeen years
prior. he was concerned about the persistence of mr. lochner’s focus on himself
and one of his colleagues. he was concerned about the fact that mr. lochner
included the home address of that colleague in one of the emails.

pc
letsche
said
he
never
forgot
the
fact
of
these
emails,
but
mentally
categorized them as having been sent from
an emotionally disturbed person. he concluded that mr. lochner
was
dissatisfied
with
results
in
court
and
was
reacting
by
“lashing
out”
at
people, including himself, via email.

at some point over the years, pc
letsche took it upon himself to learn what mr. lochner
looked
like.
he
kept
perusing
the
emails
to
see
if
“things
would
jump”.
that
said,
he continued to assess the emails as being of low concern which did not cause
him to “lose sleep at night”.

that
changed
on
march
25,
2024,
when
pc
letsche
got
a
call
from
his
brother-in-
law matthew. matthew had just received an email from mr. lochner. it was sent
to matthew’s
work
email.
it
was
directly
addressed
to
matthew,
who
was
not
a
police
officer. he was a school board employee. he was worried, unsure what to
do, and did not understand why he was getting this email.

pc
letsche
was
on
his
way
home
when
matthew
called.
he
decided
to
look
at
the
email
tomorrow
at
work.
but
he
was
concerned
about
this
contact.
his
brother-in-law
was not a police officer, or government
official, or lawyer and had no connection whatsoever to the tasering incident
from (now) eighteen years ago.

then his brother-in-law texted.
mr. lochner had emailed him again. pc letsche, who
had
been
cc’d,
decided
this
could
not
wait
until
tomorrow.
he
went
into
his
junk
mail
to
read
the
emails.
after
doing
so,
he
concluded
they
were
a
“marked
departure”
from
mr. lochner’s
past communications.

firstly, the emails sent to
matthew made it apparent, to pc letsche, that mr. lochner had researched his
family members online. these emails referenced personal information about his
family. the officer concluded this personal information had been gleaned from
his parents’ online obituaries:
hello
matthew
b [
omitted

]:
i
understand
you
are
doug
letsche’s
brother-in-
law.
therefore,
i
would
like
to
express
my
deepest
condolences
for the passing of herbert, diane and karl letsche.
your family seems
to be well respected by friends and the community as indicate by patricia and
richard p. [
last name
omitted
]

dear diane,
sincere sympathy to you in the passing of your husband. you and herb have
raised a wonderful family.
therefore, i
do
not
understand
the
actions
of
your
brother-in- law, douglas letsche.

after
cutting
and
pasting
past
emails
which
detailed
the
tasering
event
and
his
own
attempts to pursue an alleged cover-up, mr. lochner’s email continued:
therefore,
if
diane
and
herb
raised
a
wonderful
family,
why
is douglas letsche
indicating he deployed taser m26-19421 when in fact it was deployed by the etf
when executing the feeney warrant on august 11, 2006?
does
[
first
name
omitted
]

lochner,
who
is
autistic,
deserve
to be treated as a
criminal based on the lies of doug letsche and the etf?
doug letsche is fooling his
family and his friends, but he is not fooling our lord.
perhaps,
when
doug
goes
to
church
this
easter
weekend,
he will repent his sins and disclose the truth so that [
name of
defendant’s brother
] and his family can finally put closure to this matter
after some 18 years.

this email was sent just to
matthew b. and pc letsche. the next email was sent the same day about five hours
later. it was addressed to matthew and was sent to pc letsche and many others
including, to pc letsche’s belief, the pastor of his family’s church. this
email said:
hello
matthew
as a police officer and student
of the lord, why is doug letsche being rebellious and refusing to speak the
truth.
ask your brother-in-law, doug
letsche, if he deployed taser m26-19421 on august 11, 2006 after being assigned
to modified duties as a result of injuring his right hamstring in a bed race at
the “taste of the danforth”?
kindly
let
me
know
his
answer.

about five hours after that, mr.
lochner emailed matthew b [
last name omitted
] a third time. many others
were cc’d, including pc letsche. this third email reviewed mr. lochner’s view
of the tasering incident and pc letsche’s connection to it. it contained
cut-and-paste contents from past emails and alleged a cover-up. again, mr.
lochner asked matthew to inquire into the incident with his brother-in-law.
cst.
letsche’s
response
to
the
march
2024
emails

pc letsche testified that the next
day, he saw an email from mr. lochner to someone
from
his
family
church.
i
had
no
admissible
evidence
of
the
email
to
this
person. but
pc
letsche
testified
that
he,
as
part
of
his
safety
concerns,
spoke
to
his
pastor
about laying a criminal complaint against mr. lochner.

as a police officer, pc letsche
said, he was used to absorbing “red flags”. but emailing
his
brother-law
went
beyond
an
acceptable
point
of
absorption.
he
believed
the fact and content of the emails showed
mr. lochner had gone through his parents’ obituaries,
gleaned
family
member
information
from
them,
and
googled
family
names
until he got his brother-in-law’s school
board email address.

he was worried about what step mr.
lochner would take next. he could not rule out
the
defendant
presenting
danger
to
him
and
to
his
family.
he
went
to
his
sergeant
and took steps to pursue criminal charges.

as
a
result
of
mr.
lochner’s
emails
to
his
brother-in-law,
pc
letsche
took
steps
to ensure
safety
planning
was
in
place
for
himself
and
his
extended
family.
he
spoke
to
his
pastor
about laying
a criminal complaint. he religiously
carried, and
still carries,
his gun to
and
from
his
home.
he
remains
hyper-conscious
of
his
surroundings.
he
asked
for
an
officer safety bulletin to be sent out in case mr. lochner came to confront him
and encountered one of his fellow officers.
effect
of
communications
on
cst.
letsche

in
cross-examination
pc
letsche
admitted
he
had
not
read
every
single
email
mr. lochner
sent.
none
of
the
email
content,
despite its
volume, contained any
overt
threats and
the
officer
acknowledged
this
too.
letsche
also
admitted
when
he
received
emails
in 2022 and 2023, they
were on his mind, but did not cause him to feel harassed. he acknowledged
having worked more during those years, including overtime, which the defendant
suggested
was
inconsistent
with
fear.
even
during
a
recent
prep
meeting
with the crown and oic, pc letsche had
not expressed fear.

but,
the
officer
testified,
mr.
lochner’s
decision
to
reach
out
to
family
members
and how
he
did
it
raised
more
substantive
concern
in
his
mind.
he
deduced
that
the
defendant google searched the names of
family members in the obituaries, such as his wife and kids, until he found a
relative with a published email address. he considered one of the emails to his
brother-in-law a “veiled” threat but was somewhat non-responsive in explaining
that further.

in direct examination, pc
letsche’s testimony about fear was measured. he perceived
that
mr.
lochner
remained
focused
on
and
upset
with
himself,
personally,
and the
tps.
letsche
said
he
could
not
rule
out
mr.
lochner
posing
danger
to
himself
and
his family. he
characterized the steps he took as erring on the side of caution and readying
himself for unpredictability.

pc letsche was less measured in
cross-examination, when asked about his emotional
response
to
the
march
2024
emails.
he
agreed
with
the
suggestion
that
he
was concerned for his safety and the
safety of his family members. he said he worried mr. lochner was growing more
frustrated with time and that the defendant continued to believe
he
was
hiding
something.
he
was
concerned
mr.lochner could
start
to
lash
out.

he
made
safety
plans
in
case
mr.
lochner
did
lash
out
in
ways
that
put
he
and
his
family at risk. he raised safety concerns with family members – even extended
family members. he testified the communications, as a whole, caused him to
worry about his own safety, his family’s safety, and the safety of officers who
worked with him.

i
found
cst.
letsche
to
be
a
credible
and
reliable
witness.
i
accepted
his
testimony.
he was straightforward, consistent, and measured in his responses. i discerned
no attempts
to
mislead
or
exaggerate
in
his
evidence.
at
times
during
cross-examination,
pc letsche
was
non-responsive.
i
found
those
instances
occasioned
no
flaw
to
his
credibility and reliability.

i had no doubt that the occasional
failure to answer mr. lochner’s questions directly
was
attributable to
the
often-aggressive
manner
in
which
mr.
lochner
conducted his cross-examination.
applicable
legal
principles

mr.
lochner
is
charged
under
subsection (b)
of
s.
264(1)
and
(2)
which
reads:
264(1) no person shall, without
lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed or recklessly as
to whether the other person is harassed, engage in conduct referred to in
subsection (2) that causes that other person reasonably, in all the
circumstances, to fear for their safety or the safety of anyone known to them.

the
conduct
mentioned
in

(1)

or
indirectly, the other
person or anyone known to them;

the
crown
bears
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
burden
never
shifts.
there was no burden on the defence to call evidence or prove innocence. mr.
lochner began this trial with the presumption of innocence.

in
considering
the
essential
elements
of
this
offence,
r.

conduct in 264(2)(a-d) must be established;
•
it
must
be

•
it must be established that the
defendant knew the complainant was harassed, or was reckless or wilfully blind
as to whether the complainant was harassed;
•
it must be established that the
conduct caused the complainant to fear for their safety, or for the safety of
anyone known to them, and;
•
it must be established that the
complainant’s fear was, in all the circumstances, reasonable.
were
there
repeated
communications?

beginning
with
the
first
component,
i
found
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
that mr. lochner
repeatedly
communicated
with
cst.
letsche
via
email.
he
did
so
directly,
and
he
did so indirectly. he did so over the course of eighty-nine emails tendered
into the evidentiary record.

the defendant took no issue with
this aspect of the test. even if he had, rogers business records proved beyond
doubt that the email address used to send these messages was associated to
silvano lochner.
was
the
complainant
harassed?

secondly,
i
was
satisfied
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
cst.
letsche
was
harassed
by the repeated communications.
r. v. kosikar
(1999),
1999 canlii 3775 (on ca),
138 c.c.c.(3d) 217
(ont. c.a.)
held at para.
25
“….this element of the offence requires the crown
to prove that as a consequence of the prohibited act the complainant was in a
state of being harassed or felt harassed in the sense of feeling ‘tormented,
troubled, worried continually or chronically, plagued, bedeviled and badgered’.

these words are not a cumulative
collection of what the crown must prove to establish harassment. as per
r.
v. kordrostami
(2000),
2000 canlii 5670 (on ca),
143 c.c.c.(3d) 488 (ont. c.a.), establishing any of
these factors can constitute harassment. it is not necessary for the crown to
prove a complainant experienced all these emotions, or to prove that these
emotions were experienced throughout the duration of the entire timeframe
alleged.

i accepted pc letsche’s testimony
about his escalating reaction to mr. lochner’s incessant
email
accusations.
he
at
first
accepted
it
as
part
of
the
job,
albeit
an
unpleasant part. he
directed lochner’s emails into a junk mail folder, which i found he did because
he
did
not
fear
for
his
safety
then.
he
kept
them
in
mind
sufficiently
enough
to
check
their content from time to time, looking
for red flags that may require action.

no doubt pc letsche was annoyed by
the constant emails accusing him and various
other
people
of
criminal
behaviour.
it
rose
no
higher
than
that,
despite
the
volume of
emails
being
sent.
but
that
reaction
changed
in
march
2024,
when
mr.
lochner
reached out to pc letsche’s civilian brother-in-law.

those
three
march
2024
emails
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
history
of
emails
prior. even before
contacting cst. letsche through
his uninvolved brother-in-law, cst. letsche believed the
defendant to be focused on him to an unwarranted and unhealthy degree. the
earlier emails were incessant and persistent, but devoid of any threat and
constant in their theme and tone.

now, because of the march 2024
emails, cst. letsche reasonably believed mr. lochner
had
researched
his
own
personal
life.
he
believed
mr.
lochner
went
through
the obituaries of his deceased family
members and mined them for personal information about letsche. this was
blatantly obvious: lochner cut and pasted condolences that others wrote to the
family online and put them in the email to matthew.

matthew
does
not
share
the
same
last
name
as
cst.
letsche.
he
did
have
a
school board address which was publicly
available on the internet. cst. letsche concluded that mr. lochner must have
googled the names of his family members, referenced in his parents’ obituaries,
until he found a published email address. that led mr. lochner to matthew, and
mr. lochner used matthew to communicate with letsche.

in other words, cst. letsche
concluded – i find rightly – that mr. lochner’s behaviour had moved from
emailing the same incessant complaint to digging into cst. letsche’s background
and family. his march 2024 emails made a point of letting cst. letsche know
just how
much personal
information
he had
gathered.
i accepted that cst.
letsche was harassed by the emails mr. lochner sent.
did mr. lochner know or was
reckless or wilfully blind to complainant being
harassed?

i
found
the
next
element
of
criminal
harassment
met
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr. lochner was
at a minimum reckless to the complainant being harassed by his repeated communications.
at this stage, i considered the content of all the emails as well as the
repetitious
nature
of
those
emails,
together
with
the
context
in
which
the
emails
were
sent:
r. v. scuby
(2004),
2004 bcca 28 (canlii),
181 c.c.c. (3d) 97 (b.c.c.a.)
at para.
12. i
cautioned myself that recklessness does not mean mere carelessness:
r. v.
siilipp, supra,
at para. 19.

i found recklessness firmly
grounded by the evidence as a whole. one relevant factor was the lengthy
timeline engaged during which mr. lochner persisted in sending emails. another
factor was the volume of emails the defendant sent, all of which went without
a
response.
the
failure
to
respond
to
multiple
emails
would
have
communicated, to mr. lochner, that cst.
letsche did not want to communicate back.

mr. lochner persisted. indeed, he
upped the ante by digging into cst. letsche’s personal life and letting him
know that fact. i found mr. lochner did that, in particular, to provoke a
response he so very much wanted.

the content of all emails
contributed to this conclusion as well. not one email communicated an overt
threat, but neither were they all innocuous. mr. lochner communicated his
belief that cst. letsche and his colleagues were corrupt. he communicated the
belief that cst. letsche was part of a cover-up. he obviously bore ill will
towards cst. letsche. by march 2024, lochner was asserting that cst. letsche
was a sinner who would answer to a higher power.

in
pursuit
of
his
own
aims,
mr.
lochner
cared
not
for
the
impact his
emails
had
on cst. letsche. i found
beyond doubt that
he was, at
a
minimum
and
at its
most
charitable
for mr. lochner, reckless as to whether his repeated communications had the
effect of harassing cst. letsche.

frankly, by march 2024, harassing
pc letsche was likely mr. lochner’s specific goal.
he
reached
out
to
cst.
letsche’s
family
member.
he
let
letsche
know
he
was
doing
that,
because
he
cc’d
letsche
on
the
emails
to
matthew. obviously,
mr.
lochner
wanted cst.
letsche
to
know
that
he
had
found,
and
was
communicating
with,
his
brother-in-law.

mr.
lochner
referenced
cst.
letsche’s
deceased
parents
and
suggested
they
had raised him
poorly. he suggested cst. letsche had sinned in his actions relating to the
lochners, and that he would pay for those sins. these were all pressure points
that mr. lochner leaned on, in the emails to matthew, to provoke a response.

it is not criminal to be rude, or
disrespectful, or to try and upset someone. but in the
context
of
years
of
one-sided
emails,
all
focused
to
some
degree
on
cst.
letsche
and in an unwarranted way, lochner’s shift
of behaviour in march 2024 was like turning the volume
on
a
radio
up
to
maximum,
no
matter
the
effect
on
its
listener.
lochner
knew,
after years of no response, that letsche
was not interested in engaging with him. so he reached
into
letsche’s
family
life,
and
let
him
know
he
was
doing
that,
to
get
a
response. at
a
minimum,
the
defendant
was
reckless
as
to
whether
his
emails,
including
his
change in approach by
march 2024, would have the effect of harassing cst. letsche.

before
leaving
this
point,
i
must
add
that
in
considering
mr.
lochner’s
state
of
mind, i disregarded the contents of a
case he provided me. to briefly explain, mr. lochner presented
a
decision
to
the
court,
where
he
was
acquitted
of
criminal
harassment.
he
did this to
assist himself in arguing a legal point.

in closing submissions, the crown
invited me to rely on the fact, as set out in the transcript,
that
mr.
lochner
was
present
when
the
elements
of
criminal
harassment
were explained
by
that
trial
judge.
it
was
like
receiving
a
warning,
at
one’s
door,
from
police that conduct must stop. that
decision was released in october 2021. the emails in the case at bar were sent
between 2022 and 2024.

i concluded it would be unfair for
me to rely on this case for any evidentiary purpose. i appreciate that he was
the individual who presented it to me, not the crown. but what happened in that
other courtroom was not made evidence in our case. accordingly, mr. lochner did
not have the opportunity to respond to it, as he would with any other piece of
evidence.
did
the
conduct
cause
the
complainant
to
feel
fear?

the fourth essential element of
discharging the burden to prove a criminal harassment count is fear. i found
that, overall, mr. lochner’s repeated communications caused
the
complainant
to
feel
fear.
i
found
this
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
am
sure
that,
before march 2024, cst. letsche dismissed the emails as the rantings of an
emotionally disturbed
person.
streaming
them
into
junk
mail
strongly
suggested
these
emails
caused the officer no fear for his safety. indeed, he admitted the
pre-march 2024 emails did not cause him fear.

i did accept, as credible and
reliable, cst. letsche’s evidence that when mr. lochner
sent
the
march
2024
emails,
in
the
context
of
the
years
of
emails
sent
with
some focus
on
cst.
letsche,
the
officer
felt
fear.
i
accepted
he
then
took
steps
to
address
safety planning,
and
that
those
steps
were
taken
because
he
feared
for
his
personal
safety.
he communicated with fellow officers about the issue, in case mr.
lochner’s behaviour escalated to stalking him at work.

i accepted that cst. letsche spoke
to family
members about safety
planning, and i
find
he
did
that
because
he
feared
for
their
safety.
he
brought
the
communications
back to
a supervisors’
attention to
pursue criminal
charges and
again,
i
accept
that
he
did
this
because he feared for his safety and his family’s safety. he spoke to his
pastor about laying a criminal complaint. i accepted that he did this and that
this was, similarly, his response to the fear provoked by the march 2024
emails.

i have no doubt whatsoever
that cst. letsche took
these steps
and
that
he
did
so because mr. lochner’s repeated communications caused him to feel fear.
was
that
fear
reasonable?

finally,
i
must
consider
whether
cst.
letsche’s
fear
was
reasonable.
this
must
be measured
by
an
objective standard, to ensure
convictions
are
not grounded
upon overly sensitive
reactions
or
responses.
as

para.
37
of
r.
v.
wisniewska,

(s.c.a.ct.)
durno
j. said:
the
objective
component
requires
an
assessment
of
how
the reasonable person would have felt in
similar circumstances….making that determination requires a consideration of
all the circumstances, including but not limited to, the history and
circumstances surrounding the relationship
between
the
parties,
the
age,
sex,
and
race
of
the
complainant,
whether there were explicit directions to the accused to leave the complainant
alone, and the duration of the harassment.

were
this
court
to
consider
only the
emails before
march
2024,
the
answer
to
this question would be no.
firstly, i have already found cst. letsche did not feel fear
prior to that point. had he claimed to, i
would have thought that an unreasonable response. certainly, i would have had a
doubt about that. the pre-march 2024 emails were all at least partially focused
on cst. letsche. but like cst. letsche, i interpreted them as harmless emails
expressing frustration and sent by someone emotionally unable to process the
trauma of his brother’s tasering.

but
consideration
of
the
earlier
emails
could
not
be
divorced
from
the
march
2024
emails mr. lochner sent to cst. letsche’s brother-in-law. when the evidence was
considered as a whole, i found the crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that
cst. letsche’s fear was reasonable.

this conclusion was based upon an
assessment of the evidence as a whole, including but not confined to:
•
the sheer volume of emails sent to
cst. letsche, both directly and indirectly;
•
the timespan of years during which
mr. lochner communicated to and about cst. letsche;
•
mr.
lochner’s
persistence
in
his
attempts
to
communicate, despite
receiving no indication suggesting letsche would respond or welcomed contact;
•
the
content
of
the
pre-march
2024
emails,
many
of
which suggested lochner believed letsche
was part of a conspiracy to cover up tasering lochner’s disabled
brother;
•
the
quick
succession
of
those
march
2024
emails
sent
by mr. lochner;
•
the content of the march 2024
emails, which reiterated lochner’s belief that cst. letsche’s actions, in
relation to mr. lochner and his brother, proved him a sinner who would have to
face those sins;
•
the
fact
that
those
march
2024
emails
were
effected
(and i found they undoubtedly were) by
researching cst. letsche’s family members online, until mr. lochner hit upon a
published email address;
•
the extension of lochner’s focus,
in march 2024, onto cst. letsche’s family and community – his deceased parents,
people
who
noted
his
parents’
passing
online,
his brother-in-law,
and his church.

when i considered these factors and the evidence as a
whole, i was left with no doubt
about
the
reasonableness
of
cst.
letsche’s
fear.
his
fear
was
palpably
reasonable.
conclusion

the crown has
proved
all essential elements of the count of criminal harassment beyond a reasonable
doubt. mr. lochner must be found guilty.
