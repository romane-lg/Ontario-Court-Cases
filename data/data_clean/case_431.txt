for dennis rhodes
wendl j.:

on november 29, 2024, i found dennis rhodes
guilty on a multi count information, including charges of break and enter and
sexual assault on two victims. while awaiting sentencing, currently scheduled
for march 10, 2025, mr. rhodes has brought an application seeking leave to renew
his section 11(b) application. to be clear, the impugned delay is not between
the verdict and the sentence

but the delay in finishing the trial i have already rendered my verdict on.
analysis

to begin, i rely on the comments of justice dunphy:
at
this late stage, such an application must at the very least be treated as
exceptional, requiring the applicants to demonstrate cogent reasons why it
would be in the interests of justice to grant an order permitting the
application to be brought.


next is the history of this proceeding as it relates to the claim
for unreasonable delay pursuant to section 11(b).

mr. rhodes initially sought permission to bring 11(b) application
60 days prior to trial as a result of the conflict with the then new ontario
court of justice practice direction and rules about the timing of 11(b)
applications (4 months v. 60 days). i granted the application.


however, i dismissed that 11(b) application on february 13
th,
2024, because the transcripts were incomplete.


to ensure proper use of court time and as a part of my trial
management function

when mr. rhodes asked if this dismissal was with or without prejudice, i
indicated that he would be required to bring an application to the court before
he could renew the 11(b) application.

an application to renew the 11(b) motion was heard on march 28,
2024. that application was only filed on march 27, 2024 and i dismissed
it given the proximity to trial, there was insufficient time to hear the
application before trial, and that some transcripts were still missing. i also
raised concerns that the application to renew was itself only filed the day
before.

the trial began on april 17, 2024. due to court unavailability
on april 30, may 1, 2 and 3, 2024, the matter was adjourned, and the crown and
defence had to obtain new days. those dates were september 17, 18, 19, october
2, 4 and 15, 2024.

on september 17, 2024, mr. rhodes attempted to renew the
application for a second time. however, the application was again dismissed
because it did not comply with the practice direction insofar as the
requirement for the defence to advise of any 11(b) application at the time of
setting new dates for trial.

evidence in the trial finished on october 15, 2024 and the
matter was put over to november 7, 2024 for written and further oral
submissions.

on november 29, 2024, i found mr. rhodes guilty on all counts.

mr. rhodes’ submissions for leave to bring a renewed 11(b) this
time rely largely on the supreme court’s decision in
haevischer.
the crux of his submissions is that the 11(b) application is not frivolous and
should not be summarily dismissed in the name of efficiency. however, nothing
in mr. rhodes written or oral submissions directly address the timing of the
application (being after a verdict was rendered) or why this court should allow
a renewed application given the history of this matter. therefore, i requested case
law from the defence on this issue of post-conviction 11(b) applications and i
allowed for further submissions on today’s date.

for the following reasons i would dismiss the application to
renew his s. 11(b) application.

first, i have concerns that a renewal of the 11(b) application
was only raised by email to the trial coordinator on january 28, 2025. on
december 5, 2024, when the matter was set for sentencing no mention was made of
renewing the 11(b) application. on november. 29, 2024 when i rendered the verdict,
it was mr. rhodes who sought an adjournment to prepare for sentencing. while
agreeing to put the matter over to december 5, 2024, i specifically identified
the issue of 11(b) in relation to sentencing and the presumptive cap of 5
months.
 it was in response to this direct question, the question about sentencing
delay, not trial delay, that mr. rhodes indicated that 11(b) was an issue.

for the sake of specificity, i reference the exchange from
november 29, 2024:
the
court: okay. so, next week i’m in burlington on tuesday, so december 4th or
5th to be spoken to. obviously, i’d like to – unless 11(b) is in issue, we
have to do it within the timelines set out by the court of appeal, i think it’s
five months. i’d like to get it done sooner rather than later, but the 4th
or the 5th of december, ms. camara?
s.
camara: yes, so the 5th is agreeable. obviously, 11(b) is in issue, but,
yeah, we can come back on the 5th to possibly confirm that date.

again, the court did not take this exchange to raise the 11(b) issue
regarding trial delay, it is clear that the court was referencing the 5 months
cap in relation to sentencing delay.

the whole purpose of the practice direction regarding 11(b)
applications from the chief justice of the ontario court of justice is to
ensure that proper notice is given. proper and timely notice is essential. this
cannot be understated. it allows for potential mitigation of 11(b) issues by
all parties, including the crown and court. it ensures that time is not taken
away from other matters to hear an 11(b), and if matters are stayed that the
court time can be backfilled and used efficiently. it is consistent with the
direction from the supreme court of canada in
jordan

that a change of culture is required. this is why 11(b) dates must be obtained
at the time of trial or at the time of adjournment.

moreover, it is unclear whether this matter would be ready to
proceed even if i were to grant the application. at paragraph 36 of mr. rhodes’
application, he states:
there
are no controversies with respect to the facts and timeline of the matter since
february 13, 2024. the parties could very easily provide an agreed statement of
facts with respect to the timeline of the matter since february 2024.

this assertion is concerning. while it may be possible to reach
an agreed statement of facts, that is not the same as having one in place or
even having an agreement in principle with the crown. in other words, it
remains unclear whether mr. rhodes has all the necessary materials to proceed.

this concern is heightened by the fact that i previously dismissed his first
application due to his failure to obtain all the required material.


as the court of appeal noted recently in
leonard
the
burden ontario court of justice is heavier than ever.
i
am well aware of the heavy workload carried by judges of the ontario court of
justice. in recent years that workload has only increased. amendments to the
criminal code
have resulted in more trials and trials for more serious offences
in the ocj, as well as increased procedural complexity of trials. layered on
top of those challenges is the systemic impact of delays due to the covid
pandemic.


ultimately, the court can only meet the increased challenges if
materials are properly filed, matters are scheduled appropriately, and the
rules are followed.

regrettably, the history of this case demonstrates a consistent
lack of preparedness and failure to comply with the rules. i am not satisfied
that allowing a renewed 11(b) after conviction is justified in the
circumstances. while i acknowledge the rules are servants and not masters, i again
agree with justice dunphy:
we
shall never succeed in conquering the culture of delay that has infected our
criminal justice system by turning a blind eye to clear violation of simple
rules whose purpose is to vouchsafe the very right the applications seek to
vindicate. post-verdict s. 11(b) applications ought to occur only in
exceptional circumstances and no such circumstances have been alleged or
demonstrated.


the application to renew the 11(b) is dismissed.
