total defence caused
 delay
103
[
6.]
the net delay in
this case is 433 days,
or 14.2 months, which is under the
jordan
presumptive ceiling of 18
months in the provincial court. as such, there is no need to consider any
exceptional circumstances nor the complexity, if any, of the matter.
[
7.]
in this case the
total delay is below the presumptive ceiling and therefore there was no need
for me to assess either net delay or remaining delay, including defence caused
delay. however, the exercise was relevant to the assessment of whether the
defendant has met his onus of demonstrating that the time to trial in this case
was unreasonable.
[
8.]
to succeed in a stay
application where the delay is under the presumptive ceiling, an applicant must
establish both of the following conditions. first, that he made a sustained
effort to expedite the proceedings to trial. second, that the case took
markedly longer than it should have. a stay of proceedings in cases falling
beneath the presumptive ceiling will be granted only in the clearest of cases.
[
9.]
with respect to the
first condition, and upon hearing from counsel and reviewing the transcripts,
the information, the correspondences in the application record, and the trial
scheduling sheet, it would appear that:
(a)
following
the first appearance in november 2023, the case seemed to be on track to
resolve without a trial. to this end, a potential guilty was scheduled for
february 15, 2024;
(b)
on
february 15, 2024, the defendant did not plead guilty and decided to deal with
the matter in two simultaneous, but distinct tracks. first, he wanted to
pursue a trial. second, he also continued to negotiate a resolution to a
reduced offence. in furtherance of these objectives, as well discussing a
complaint about disclosure of the audio of a police video, a jpt was held on
march 11, 2024.
(c)
at the
pretrial held march 11, 2024, it appears the parties agreed the case would take
1.5 days regardless of the outstanding disclosure.
(d)
despite
the crown persistently urging the matter to be set down for trial, the defence
only did so on august 16, 2024, some six months after the time estimate was
made. the trial was set for 1.5 days, just as agreed to in the spring.
[
10.]
between march and august
2024, defence counsel spent much of this period trying to convince the crown to
resolve the matter in a manner favourable to his client instead of setting the
case for trial. he also sent numerous requests for disclosure for an
unredacted copy of the investigating officer’s in-car camera. instead of
setting the trial as soon as possible and continue his efforts at persuasion in
the interim, he seemed content to exhaust all efforts to resolve before having
to set the trial.
[
11.]
in november 2023 the
chief of our court issued the
jordan
-compliant scheduling practice
direction. 
it is designed to counter the “culture of complacency” in criminal matters
lamented by
the supreme court in
jordan
and ensure that a person’s right
to trial within a reasonable time is respected. the direction represents a fundamental
transformation of how criminal cases proceed in the ontario court of justice. being
practice direction, counsel are professionally obligated to follow it and
courts are responsible for enforcing it. counsel are dutybound to (a) inform
themselves of all practice directions issued by the chief of the court and (b)
adhere to those directions, whether they like it or not. this direction was
in force as of november 1, 2023, and applied to the entire history of this
case. given the duty of everyone to know and follow the direction, there was
never a need to bring it to anyone’s attention at any point in the proceedings.
[
12.]
one aspect of the
direction is to set a trial date within six months of the charge being laid,
even where (a) there are disclosure issues, (b) the parties are negotiating a
resolution, or (c) both. i find the crown and court were ready to set a trial
within six months but the defence was not.
[
13.]
mr. ibarra took a
more traditional, pre-direction approach by expending a great of energy in
pursuing resolution instead following the direction by setting a trial and then
working backwards from there to resolve it and/or address disclosure issues.
mr. o’connor is an experienced, highly respected,
and excellent lawyer who has been in practice for many years before our chief
implemented a major shakeup of how we do business. mr. o’connor appeared to be
content to deal with the case in the “old way” as he had been accustomed to for
many years. while habits are hard to break and customs difficult to change,
the
jordan
-compliant scheduling direction has effectively put a kibosh
on this way of practice by every justice participant.
[
14.]
examining the
situation objectively, it cannot be said that the defence worked as
expeditiously as was reasonable in the circumstances for the reasons just
discussed. more to the point, i find that a trial date should have been set
shortly after the march 11, 2024, pre-trial instead of doing so in august 2024. 
this unnecessary delay resulted in a squandered opportunity to secure trial
dates much earlier than those selected.
[
15.]
additionally, the
record demonstrates that counsel for the defence delayed the setting of jpts
and the trial by stating that he was not familiar with the practice in
orangeville. indeed, mr. o’connor said as much in his submissions but blamed
what he called an unfamiliar and unnecessarily byzantine trial scheduling
process in orangeville that requires parties to schedule jpt and trial dates
through a trial coordinator. one could countenance that excuse being proffered
once, but not more than that after being informed of what was expected.
[
16.]
here, counsel was
met with having to navigate the local scheduling process in early march 2024. at
that point he knew or ought to have known how things work in dufferin county. in
his submissions, mr. o’connor acknowledged that he “did not cotton onto” the local
scheduling system until mid-july. unfortunately, counsel was not diligent to
move the case forward because he did not readily educate himself or conform
with local and long-established procedures, however arcane and inefficient he
feels they are.
[
17.]
the defence submits
that the delay in setting the trial came in no small measure from unanswered
complaints about disclosure. i respectfully disagree because:
(a)
it turns out these
complaints about disclosure had no impact on either the trial estimate or when
the trial could reasonably be scheduled;
(b)
given that the determination of disclosure
issues is ultimately the purview of the trial judge, the defendant should have
set trial dates as soon as possible and set a disclosure hearing if he was
unhappy with the responses (or lack thereof) of the crown; and
(c)
in this case, the defendant was given
substantial core disclosure at the very earliest of dates. all defendants are
entitled to full, but not perfect, disclosure. he was aware of the case he had
to meet early on, and he does not appear to have been prejudiced by the absence
of complete disclosure prior to setting the trial. in submissions, it was
acknowledged that the defence received the unredacted in-car video in march
2024 which means that outstanding disclosure was not an impediment to setting
trials dates sooner than they did.
[
18.]
taking a
bird’s eye view as i must, i find that on the record before me that the defence
did not make sustained efforts to bring the matter to trial for the reasons i
described. as a result, he has not met his onus on the first condition to be
satisfied by him. consequently, his application to stay the proceeding fails.
[
19.]
if i am
wrong on my assessment of the first condition, this case did not take longer (let
alone “markedly” so) than it reasonably should have in the circumstances. it is
a simple 1.5-day drink/drive trial, and had it been set shortly after the time
estimate was made in march 2024 it is very likely that it would have been
completed well before may, 2025. given my finding that the remaining delay in
this case is just over 14 months, this is well within the acceptable scheduling
parameters for the ontario court of justice and significantly under the
jordan
presumptive ceiling. as a result, the defendant has not met his onus on the
second condition and the stay application must be dismissed on this basis.
[
20.]
even if i am wrong
on both points, this is not the “clearest of cases” in which a stay should be
entered given the situation as i have assessed because the crown and the court
did nothing to stymie the applicant’s access to timely justice.
[
21.]
the application
dismissed. parties shall appear for trial commencing on may 5, 2025, at 10:00
a.m. in orangeville courtroom 101.
