counsel for the accused, d. murray
murphy j.:

mr. murray was arrested for several counts of fraud
over $5,000 in may of 2019. information no. 19-2152 was sworn on june 4, 2019
and it alleged 20 counts of fraud over $5,000 and three counts of fraud under
$5,000.

mr. murray’s trial commenced on march 8, 2021
and it continued for a total of 21 trial days over almost four years before
justice l. serre. in february of 2025, the chief justice of the ontario court
of justice determined that justice serre was no longer able to continue the trial. 
at that time, chief justice nicklas determined that the trial would have to
restart before a different judge, as a continuing trial. continuing trial
dates were set to start on june 2, 2025 and to finish on august 15, 2025, for
an additional 32 days of trial.

when the new dates were coordinated and noted on
the record, it was also noted that the defence would be filing an 11(b)
application, seeking a stay of proceedings, as they claimed mr. murray’s
charter
right to be tried within a reasonable time, pursuant to s. 11(b), had been
violated. this is the first time that the court was put on notice that mr.
murray was claiming that his 11(b) rights were violated or were going to be
violated for delay. the defence seeks a remedy of a stay, pursuant to s. 24(2)
of the
charter.

this ruling deals with that application.

by way of the detailed calculations set out
below, i find that the time required to conduct mr. murray’s trial has exceeded
18 months, by a period of 21 days. accordingly, i find that mr. murray’s right
to have a trial conducted within a reasonable time has been breached, and
pursuant to s. 24(2) of the
charter
of rights and freedoms, i
intend to
enter a stay of proceedings, after trial
submissions.
calculation of time

the defence and crown agree that the total time
that elapsed between the swearing of the first information and completion of
the evidence at trial was 2,264 days or 74.43 months. there is no dispute that
this total delay would be over the
jordan
ceiling of 18 months, if no
adjustments were made.

both counsel have submitted that no deduction
should be made due to a claim of complexity of the case, despite the fact that
the evidence at trial ultimately took 29 days to complete.

in addition, for this decision, i am acting as
though the trial completed on august 15, 2025. however, that is the date
that the evidence was completed, and the
charter
application submissions
were given. we have adjourned the trial to october 9, 2025, for submissions on
the trial. with the consent of the defence, i have been asked to rule on the
11(b) issue prior to counsel arguing the merits of the crown’s case.

not surprisingly, the area of dispute between
crown and defence is what periods of time constitute defence delay or
defence-caused delay, what periods of time are properly characterized as discrete
events and what periods of time are institutional delay.
position of the parties

the defence acknowledges that there is defence
delay or defence caused delay of 385 days. most of the periods of time that
the defence admits delay, the crown also claims is defence delay. however,
some of the time periods are characterized by the crown as discrete events. i
will deal with this issue below.

the crown submits that the total defence caused
delay should be calculated as 597 days, with an additional 64 days that the crown
says is either defence delay or discrete event between march 5 and june 1,
2025.

if i give effect to the crown’s calculation for
days in dispute, the defence would be responsible for an additional 276 days
than what the defence says. when combined with what the crown claims are
deductions for discrete events, the crown submits that the total remaining
delay is 14.89 months, which is under the 18 month ceiling set by the supreme
court in
r. v. jordan,
2016 scc 27.

if i give effect to the calculation of the
defence, the total remaining delay is 59.4 months, which is clearly in excess
of the 18 month ceiling.
discrete events

the defence has suggested that there was no
evidence to support a claim that the matter was delayed due to discrete events.

i have reviewed the records submitted, including
the affidavit sworn by amanda lalljee, sworn on july 3, 2025 and various emails
attached to that affidavit. while it is true that the defence did not have the
affidavit of ms. lalljee prior to drafting his argument and, therefore, may not
have had all of the email exchanges which were sent in an effort to schedule
dates, there was ample evidence available to him regarding discrete events in
the form of the transcripts of the proceedings.

the first discrete event is attributable to the
covid-19 protocols, the direction by the chief justice of ontario regarding
suspension of setting trial dates for out of custody matters between march 2020
and october 2020, the echo from that event, and the resurgence and further
protocol adjourning scheduled trial dates for out of custody matters in may of
2021. mr. murray’s matter was directly affected by these discrete events. the
matter essentially went into suspension before a trial date could be set, it
was then scheduled for trial, part of which had to be vacated and rescheduled
in may of 2021, all directly as a result of the protocols.

the second discrete event is the requirement of defence
counsel, mr. fabris, to have emergency orthopedic surgery in the summer of
2021. mr. fabris was notified of the surgery after the trial was scheduled to
take place, and it appears that mr. fabris was unaware as to when the surgery
would be scheduled when he set the trial dates, based on the transcripts. this
event prompted an adjournment of the trial dates scheduled in the summer of
2021.

the third discrete event is that the original trial
judge, justice l. serre, was unavailable to conduct the trial on at least three
occasions, which prompted adjournments. although there is no reason given for
justice serre’s absence, it is not appropriate for the parties to probe or to
be given reasons for her absence. she was not available to conduct the trial,
and her unavailability prompted adjournments. the claim by the defence that
the crown should have made inquiries is without merit. ultimately, a decision was
rendered by the chief justice of the ontario court of justice that justice
serre could not continue the trial. she directed that the trial had to
restart.

all of these discrete events are tied directly
to the time that expired between the date of charge and the conclusion of the trial. 
each, either separately, or in combination, caused delay which could not have
been foreseen or ameliorated.

i find that there is ample evidence to support these
several discrete events, namely the covid-19 protocols, which delayed setting
any trial dates between march of 2020 and october of 2020 and which also
interrupted the trial in may of 2021, the emergency surgery of the defence counsel
of record in the summer of 2021 and the unanticipated leaves of the trial judge,
justice l. serre, and ultimate finding by the chief justice of ontario that the
trial must restart.

each of those events were unanticipated and
unforeseen when either attempting to set trial dates or having set trial dates
in the continuation of trial. there was nothing the crown could do to
ameliorate those events. in fact, there is ample evidence, as born out in the
transcripts and the emails, that the crown was urging the earliest possible
dates to be set, as there was a significant concern about the passage of time. 
i will deal with each period and its corresponding discrete event or events
below.
delay in filing the application

the crown submits that the defence delayed in
filing the application and, accordingly, did not permit the court or the crown
to ameliorate the delay. accordingly, the crown submits that any remaining
delay should be considered defence delay. the crown cites
r. v. j.f.,
2022 scc 17, as authority:
 defence conduct is considered under the
jordan
framework,
since the delay attributable to the defence is subtracted from the gross total
delay (para. 60). defence delay has two components: (1) delay waived by
the defence, and (2) delay caused solely or directly by the defence (
jordan,
at paras.
61 and 63;
cody, at para.
26
). inaction may amount to illegitimate
conduct on the part of the defence, because “[i]llegitimacy may extend to
omissions as well as acts” (
cody, at para.
33
). as this court said in
cody,
the defence may not benefit from its own inaction or lateness in taking action;
it must act proactively:
accused
persons must bear in mind that a corollary of the s. 11(
b
) right
“to be tried within a reasonable time” is the responsibility to avoid causing
unreasonable delay. defence counsel are therefore expected to “actively
advanc[e] their clients’ right to a trial within a reasonable time,
collaborat[e] with crown counsel when appropriate and... us[e]
court time efficiently” (
jordan, at para.
138
). [para. 33]
 an accused who sees delay lengthening must therefore
respond in a proactive manner. being proactive may mean filing a s. 11(b)
motion where the accused believes that their right to be tried within a
reasonable time is not being or will not be respected (
jordan, at
para.
85
). like any other application made by an
accused, a motion of this kind must be brought “reasonably and expeditiously”
(para. 85). lateness in raising delay is contrary to the proper
administration of justice, because such a practice serves to waste judicial
resources. indeed, the
jordan
framework is specifically
designed to eliminate inefficient practices that impact on the justice system
(paras. 41 and 116). bringing a s. 11(b) motion before the end of
the trial allows the accused to alert the crown and the court to their concerns
about delay. as a result, all parties can take proactive measures and
cooperate to expedite the proceedings.
 it is generally recognized that an accused who raises
the unreasonableness of delay after trial (
r. v. rabba
(1991),
1991 canlii 7073 (on ca), 64 c.c.c.
(3d) 445 (ont. c.a.)), and particularly after conviction (
r. v. warring,
2017 abca 128, 347 c.c.c. (3d) 391, at
para.
11;
r. v. c.d.,
2014 abca 392, 588 a.r. 82), is not acting
in a timely manner. in
k.g.k., moldaver j. interpreted the
prospective approach adopted in
jordan
as “encourag[ing]
pre‑trial
s. 11(
b
)
applications” (para. 43 (emphasis added)). the defence is in fact
encouraged to act before the start of the trial, since the
jordan
framework
allows “the parties to know ‘
in advance, the bounds of reasonableness so
proactive measures can be taken to remedy any delay’” (
k.g.k., at
para.
43, quoting
jordan, at
para.
108
(emphasis in original)).

in short, a
duty to act proactively also rests on the accused. as a result, the accused
must indicate that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has not
been respected and, where the circumstances require, bring a motion for a stay
of proceedings in a timely manner. as a general rule, this means before the
trial is held. by the time the trial dates are set, the parties are
generally in a position to know whether the trial delay will exceed the
applicable presumptive ceiling, and the defence can raise any concerns it may
have. however, it is not out of the question that, exceptionally, an
infringement of the s. 11(b) right will reveal itself only once the trial
has begun. in such a case, the accused must also act proactively.

a review of the timeline below reveals that
although the defence did not raise issues regarding filing an 11(b) application
with the court until february of 2025, the crown was alive to the issue of
delay, and he repeatedly made efforts to seek additional and earlier dates. he
had been put on notice by the defence as early as september 28, 2023 that the
defence intended to file an 11(b) application. shortly after, defence counsel
was removed and another defence lawyer was retained. further, there were very
clearly discrete events related to covid-19 and the associated directives, the
medical condition of counsel and the unexpected and repeated unavailability of
the judge which certainly affected the calculation of delay. in addition,
there were multiple changes of counsel for mr. murray. calculating the delay
in this matter was complicated and not straightforward.

in addition, it was not simply discrete events
which caused delay in relation to this matter. there was a significant
underestimation of the amount of time required to complete this trial.

despite the original estimate of four weeks in
january of 2020 at a self-represented judicial pretrial, a second pretrial with
counsel resulted in a trial estimate of 3 weeks, or 15 days. the trial
coordinator offered 12 days for trial, and asked if the trial would be
completed within that time. the crown said that they would need the entire 15
days. after two days of trial, it became apparent that the original estimate
of 15 days was going to be wholly inadequate, and both crown and defence repeatedly
sought additional days.

ultimately, the crown’s case took 20 days to
complete before justice serre, and the defence case started. mr. murray
testified in-chief over three days before justice serre could not continue. at
this point, a new trial had to be coordinated, and it was scheduled for 32
days.

the length of the trial was required despite
many critical admissions by the defence, which were fundamental to the case. 
the contracts and the parties to the contracts, the work that was done or not
done, the banking records and the incorporation documents all were admitted
into evidence by mr. murray as a self-represented person in january of 2020. 
those admissions were relied on by the crown throughout the entire proceeding.

there are periods of time noted below that i
have found should properly be split between the crown and the defence for the
initial failure to properly estimate the amount of time required for the trial
to complete.

it cannot be laid entirely at the feet of one
party or the other, and it cannot be completely explained by the phenomenon of zoom
trials taking longer. only part of this trial was conducted by zoom, and there
were certainly delays caused by that, but the majority of delay would have
occurred regardless of whether or not the trial was conducted virtually.

the amount of time set aside was clearly
inadequate, given that the crown’s evidence consisted of 45 complainant
witnesses, two witnesses from the city of sudbury, one witness from a window
manufacturer and the investigating officer. that totalled 49 witnesses. as
well, the crown filed a similar fact application which had to be argued. all
of this was known to the crown and defence when the trial estimate was
determined and dates were set.

in addition, mr. murray made it clear from the
start that he intended to call a defence. in fact, he was the only defence
witness. his examination in-chief took three days in the first trial before
the trial was interrupted by justice serre’s inability to continue. in the
second continued trial, his chief took 6 and-a-half days. he was then cross‑examined
for 7 and-a-half days.

it should also be noted that there was a
technical glitch in the middle of the reconvened trial, where it became
apparent that some of the evidence of one witness and all of the evidence of
another was completely lost, due to a problem with the sound recording in the courtroom. 
we were alerted to that problem, as all participants were routinely ordering
transcripts of the proceedings. the transcriptionist noticed that there
appeared to be missing evidence, and notified the crown. that necessitated
recalling two witnesses, which used an additional half day, which otherwise
would not have been necessary. i note that this was with the consent of the
defence. as well, we were notified of a problem with the sound equipment on a
different day, in which about 4 minutes of the evidence of another witness was
garbled and could not be understood. when alerted, the defence chose to simply
continue, rather than seek another remedy. he had satisfied himself that he
could continue. i am grateful to crown counsel and to defence counsel for the
manner in which these issues were dealt. these issues could have derailed this
trial, at least temporarily. instead, they were dealt with efficiently and
expeditiously, and we were able to move on.

also, when the trial was restarted, mr. murray
had the option to simply pick up where his trial left off, given that there
were transcripts available of all of the proceedings before justice serre,
which could be reviewed and relied upon by the replacement judge. he chose to
start all over again. while mr. murray had the right to do that, his choice
had a significant impact upon the length of the trial.

accordingly, it was a combination of factors
that were ongoing and evolving, which affected mr. murray’s right to a trial
within a reasonable time. it is difficult to point to a particular point in
time when the defence knew that an application should be filed. it cannot be
said in the context of this particular case that the defence simply sat and
waited for the delay to accrue to the point where the crown and the court would
be unable to ameliorate. therefore, i decline to attribute any time periods as
defence delay, or defence caused delay due to the crown’s claim of late filing
of his 11(b) application.
calculating the attribution of time

there are many ways of assessing the evidence. 
in these circumstances, i will examine each period of time in a timeline,
evaluate which periods of time are defence delay or defence-caused delay, which
are discrete events, and which are institutional delay. i do so in these
exceptional circumstances because of the length of time that transpired between
the laying of the first information and the date of the last court attendance. 
that period of time is five years and 2 and-a-half months. in order to be certain
that i am not missing any periods of time, i will deal with them in a continual
timeline. i will then examine the entire timeframe and apply the
jordan
framework, by deducting defence caused delay from the total delay to determine
the net delay. next i will deduct the total time attributable to discrete events
which results in determining the remaining delay.
june 4, 2019 to september 24, 2019 –
112 days

the information was laid on june 4, 2019. the
crown and defence both agree that the period between june 4 and september 24,
2019 is neither defence delay nor a discrete event. i agree. it is properly
characterized as an intake period. accordingly, it is institutional delay of
112 days.
september 24, 2019 to march 18, 2020
– 176 days

the crown claims that the entire period between september
25, 2019 to march 18, 2020 is either defence delay or defence caused delay,
due to mr. murray’s failure to retain counsel. the defence claims that none of
the period is attributable to the defence, given that mr. murray had made
ongoing efforts to obtain a legal aid certificate, the difficulties caused by
conflicts due to the 45 complainants with local counsel, and his ultimate retainer
of counsel from elliott lake.

i have reviewed the transcripts of that period
of time, and the copies of the informations. what is revealed is that mr.
murray was initially charged with 20 counts of fraud, in may of 2019, and the information
was laid on june 4, 2019. on his first appearance in court on july 3, 2019, he
had already obtained disclosure and had already started his application for
legal aid. on his subsequent attendances in court, mr. murray indicated that
he wanted counsel and was pursuing that. he also advised the court of his
efforts to satisfy legal aid’s requirements.

on his second attendance, he had arranged for an
agent, mr. fournier, to assist him. mr. fournier was retained on unrelated
matters, and anticipated that he would be retained in relation to the fraud
allegations. mr. murray was told to “step on the gas” regarding his
application for legal aid, to retain mr. fournier. on the next court
attendance, mr. murray through mr. fournier advised the court that he was
having trouble obtaining financial information to satisfy legal aid.

the next attendance in court for mr. murray was
august 28, 2019, at which time, he attended and advised the court through the
agent who assisted him, that legal aid had responded with forms that had to be
completed. he had not yet received the forms, but he expected that he would
get them soon. he asked for a further adjournment to complete the forms. by
the next attendance, on september 25, 2019, mr. murray had responded to legal
aid, but indicated that legal aid was backlogged and had not yet reviewed his
material. he sought a further adjournment and the matter was adjourned to
october 16, 2019.

on october 16, 2019, agent for mr. fournier
indicated that mr. fournier was retained on this matter, and that a pre-trial
had been conducted.

on november 13, 2019, agent for mr. fournier
confirmed that mr. murray had been approved for legal aid, but that he needed
some time to retain counsel, as there were new charges coming, first returnable
on december 11, 2019.

on december 11, 2019, mr. murray advised that
due to the charges, he was having difficulty finding counsel who was not in
conflict. the matters were set for a self‑represented judicial pretrial
on january 7, 2020.

as of january 7, 2020, mr. murray had only had
one prior appearance in relation to the second information. there was yet a
third information before the court for which this was the first return and he
had not yet received disclosure on the second information. he was taking
active steps to address the concerns from legal aid. he had a certificate from
legal aid, but he had problems finding counsel who would take the certificate. 
he tried local counsel without success. when he tried out of town counsel,
they required travel expenses to be covered. legal aid had denied that
request, but that denial was under appeal. he had attended all court
appearances, and he advised the court either through an agent appearing or
himself, of his ongoing efforts to retain counsel. in fact, at one point,
agent for mr. fournier indicated that mr. fournier was retained.

to say that mr. murray was doing nothing to
advance his case would in no sense be accurate. in fact, mr. murray had been
charged with another set of charges in december of 2019, and had not been able
to deal with them. further, the crown at the pretrial indicated that he had a
conversation with the investigating officer, and had already determined that he
was intending to consolidate the entirety of both original informations into
one count of fraud over. however, there had already been sworn an information
that consolidated all of the charges into one information, with all but one count
(count 16) naming individual complainants. later in the pretrial, the crown
indicated that he was going to withdraw the two original informations and
proceed on the consolidated information.

in light of these circumstances, it is not
appropriate to attribute this part of the period to defence delay. it is
apparent that the crown’s case was evolving given the second information with
additional counts, the third consolidated information, and the crown’s
submissions at the pretrial.

as well, mr. murray did not have disclosure for
the second set of charges. he was pursuing legal aid, and had in fact been
granted a certificate. what was in issue was who was going to be counsel. mr.
fournier had attended on his behalf or had sent agents on his behalf, until
december of 2019. an inference can be drawn that it was the laying of the
second information, which caused mr. fournier to be in conflict, not anything
that mr. murray did.

the judicial pretrial judge observed that the
trial was likely to take 4 weeks time to complete. the matter was adjourned to
january 21, 2020, for mr. murray to confirm that his legal aid matter had been
straightened out, and that he had counsel. if counsel was arranged by that
date, then a subsequent judicial pretrial would be arranged.

on january 21, 2020, mr. murray told the court
that he disclosed to legal aid additional income information, which then
prompted legal aid to cancel his certificate. he had launched an appeal of
that decision. the matter was then set to feb 6, 2020 for a continuing self-represented
pretrial continuation for half-a-day. although mr. murray was making efforts to
retain counsel through legal aid, his efforts were not successful. the period
between january 7, 2020 and february 6, 2020 is defence delay. although mr.
murray was making efforts, his efforts appear to have not been fruitful. his
situation essentially remained unchanged. it is understandable that he was
pursuing legal aid, and had in fact obtained a certificate to assist him, but
he had an obligation to consider his ability to retain counsel without the
benefit of a certificate.

on february 6, 2020, mr. murray attended and
advised that his legal aid was still under appeal. the court conducted a
fulsome pretrial regarding the matter, but mr. murray was not able to
elect his mode of trial. the trial estimate was three to four weeks for the
crown’s case. the estimate was the same, if the matter was to be scheduled for
a preliminary inquiry. mr. murray indicted that he intended to call between 10
and 30 witnesses, so that also had to factor into the trial estimate.

mr. murray was given time to consider his
options regarding mode of trial. the elections available to him were explained
in detail. the matter was adjourned to march 10, 2020 in order for mr.
murray to elect, and to set either a preliminary inquiry date or a trial date.

the court observed that the matter was being
adjourned for a month, there was some complexity to the charges, there was an
anticipated witness list of 50 witnesses for the crown and mr. murray did not
yet have counsel. an 11(b) was discussed. in fact, mr. murray asked what
would happen if he waived his 11(b) rights, but he was never asked whether or
not he intended to waive those rights as a self-represented person. in fact,
the court specifically said that mr. murray would need to consider the matter
before the question was asked of him. the crown expressed some concern about
the passage of time, and wanted to schedule trial dates or preliminary inquiry
dates on march 10, 2020. the court observed that if counsel were retained on
march 10, 2020 he or she might request an adjournment to be properly prepared
to advise mr. murray on that issue.

the matter was adjourned for a month, the only
purpose for which was to ascertain whether or not mr. murray had retained counsel. 
this is defence delay even in light of the substantive step taken by way of the
pretrial. until mr. murray elected his mode of trial, the matter was
essentially at a stand-still, and there could be no forward progress.

on march 10, 2020, mr. murray advised that the
legal aid issues had not been resolved, but he had privately retained mr.
fabris from elliott lake. mr. fabris was not available to attend court, but
that he was seeking an adjournment regarding elections and setting dates, in
order to properly review the disclosure.

the next adjournment was to march 27 or march 25,
2020, which was impacted by the protocols associated with the covid-19
pandemic. however, it became clear in later attendances that mr. murray had
not yet fully retained mr. fabris. the matter was brought forward to march 18,
2020.

at each appearance after september, the crown
expressed concern about the passage of time. the court and the crown made
efforts to move the matter along. however, the laying of the second and the
third informations substantively affected mr. murray and changed his
jeopardy. at no point did mr. murray expressly waive delay.

however, it was only after mr. murray attended
the self-represented pretrial, and all three informations were before the court
for at least the second time that the delay falls upon mr. murray. by that
point, he had been attempting to persuade legal aid to assist him for about 7
months. he had successfully obtained a certificate, but then had trouble
finding a lawyer to take the certificate. then the certificate was cancelled. 
i have not considered the first seven months to be delay caused by the defence,
partly because of the reasonableness of his pursuit of legal aid. it is only
after the pretrial, when it was made clear to mr. murray that the matter could
not be delayed any further, that i begin counting defence caused delay. the
crown did attempt to move the matter forward, and so did the court. it was mr.
murray’s insistence that he be given more time to retain a lawyer that was the
sole cause of the delay after the pretrial.

accordingly, the total defence caused delay
between september 24, 2019 to march 18, 2020 is limited to between january 7,
2020 and march 18, 2020 or 71 days.

the balance of the time is institutional time
between september 25, 2019 and january 7, 2020 – 105 days
march 18, 2020 to october 28, 2020 –
224 days

the matter was brought forward to march 18,
2020, in accordance with the covid‑19 protocols. the time after this
date is a discrete event directly related to the covid-19 interruption in the court
process. it was completely unforeseen, and there was nothing that any
participant in the process could do to ameliorate that interruption. in fact,
it was a unique event in court history.

the defence characterized the first period between
march 18, 2020 to may 4, 2020 as defence delay due to an illness by counsel for
mr. murray. the crown characterized the same period as a discrete event. in
my view, it is properly characterized as a discrete event, regardless of
whether or not it was caused by an illness of counsel or the covid‑19
pandemic. either way, it was unforeseen and the crown could not have
ameliorated that delay.

the defence agreed that the period of time
between august 5, 2020 and october 14, 2020 as “covid delay” meaning a discrete
event, so i will not examine that period any further other than to observe
that, in examining the defence chart attached to their materials, there appears
to be some confusion or perhaps a typographical error. the defence claims that
the period between may 4, 2020 and october 14, 2020 is defence delay of 70
days. the next entry claims that the period between august 5, 2020 and october
20, 2020 is “covid delay”. these two date ranges are duplicated. may 4 to
august 5, 2020 is 56 days. august 5, 2020 to october 14, 2020 is 70 days. 
defence accounted for two periods of 70 days each. the first time period is
clearly in error.

in light of the unforeseen event of the covid-19
pandemic, and the corresponding court shutdown, and restart under restrictions,
i find that the entire period between march 18, 2020 to october 28, 2020 is
a discrete event of 224 days.

in the intervening time, based on the emails,
which were attached to the crown material, there was a subsequent jpt held, in
which it appears that both counsel and justice buttazoni agreed that the trial
could be conducted in three weeks. defence counsel advised that he was not
available in the month of april of 2021. the trial coordinator offered 12
days, and asked if the matter could be finished in 12 days. the crown
indicated that 12 days would not be sufficient and asked for an additional
three days.
october 28, 2020 to march 8, 2021 –
131 days

the next period of time is time that is allotted
within the
jordan
framework is a period of institutional delay, or time
that is not deducted. it is a period of 131 days.

the crown claims that the period between october
28, 2020 and march 1, 2021 is a discrete event. it is followed by a period of 7
days, after the confirmation hearing held on march 1, 2021. the defence claims
that this period is “court delay” or “crown delay”.

there does not appear to be a reason for which
the crown claims that this is a discrete event. i infer that the claim arises
from the court coming out of the original covid-19 restrictions, and the corresponding
shut-down and the suspension of scheduling of trials until october of 2020. 
however, on october 28, 2020 trial dates were confirmed for march 8, 9, 10, 11,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29 and 30, april 1, may 3, 4 and 5, 2021, for a total of 15
days. the trial dates were set outside the
jordan
deadlines, given that
in normal times, the trial would have had to be completed within 18 months of june
of 2019, or by the end of november of 2020. delay was not canvassed during
this court attendance, and these appear to be the first dates available. this
is a period of about four months, and it is a normal amount of time that would
be required between date setting and the first day of trial. it is not defence
delay, and it is not a discrete event. it is part of the
jordan
framework.
 defence was offered april 12 to 16, but was not available, which will be
addressed in the next section.
march 8, 2021 to april 28, 2021 – 51
days

on march 8, 2021 the trial started and continued
through to april 1, 2021 for 12 days of trial. what must be noted is that when
the trial dates were being set, the defence was not available for the entire
month of april of 2021. trial coordination offered april 12 through april 18,
2021 as available dates, for which the crown was available. because of defence
unavailability, the anticipated completion of the trial was scheduled into may
of 2021. therefore, 5 days is attributable to defence caused delay and 46 days
is inherent time required for trial.

however, what must also be considered is the
underestimate of the time needed for trial. for some reason, despite the judge
observing that four weeks was required during the first pretrial, only 15 days
were scheduled. there is an inference that there is a combination of
responsibility for this miscalculation, between defence, the crown and the
court, given that the change in estimate to three weeks seems to have come
after a second judicial pretrial in which defence counsel participated. i will
deal with this issue below.

the trial commenced on march 8, 2021 for the
scheduled dates. march 11, 2021 was adjourned after a half-day, due to the
defence counsel attending a medical appointment.

on march 10, 2021, the crown reached out to
trial coordination, to advise that the trial would not be completed within the
allotted time, and he requested to secure four more days to be added to the trial
schedule. he noted that one reason for additional time required was that
conducting a trial remotely caused the trial to proceed more slowly than originally
anticipated. this phenomenon has become well known, and it is a legitimate
reason for a trial to take longer than originally anticipated. when the trial
date was originally scheduled, it was not anticipated that it would continue
remotely, and this was unforeseen. there is no consequence to this part of the
underestimation. it will be considered to be inherent time for trial.

the trial coordinator suggested may 24, 25, 26,
27 and 28, 2021. the crown advised that he was not available. the defence
does not appear to have responded. on march 23, 2021, the crown sought more
dates from trial coordination. the trial coordinator offered may 17, 2021 but
neither crown nor defence was available. the trial coordinator then offered
june 8, 9 and 11, 2021. defence was not available for any of those dates. on
march 26, 2021, the trial coordinator then confirmed that june 22 and 24, july
20, august 24 and september 1, 2021 would be continuation dates. despite the agreement
that august 24, 2021 was a date to be confirmed, and an order on the record
that august 24, 2021 was to be endorsed, it was not done. the other dates were
endorsed. this appears to be a clerical error.
april 28, 2021 to september 1, 2021
– 126 days discrete event

the crown claims this entire period is as a
result of a combination of discrete events due to the covid-19 directive and
the need for defence counsel to undergo surgery. the defence claims that this
entire period, except for 19 days which he claims is defence delay, due to
challenges in scheduling continuation dates.

for the reasons noted below, i find that this
entire period is due to discrete events.

on april 21, 2021, a directive was released from
the office of the chief justice of ontario, that in an effort to curb a
resurgence in covid-19, all trials scheduled between april 26 and may 7, 2021
for accused who were out of custody were to be adjourned, subject to an order
by the trial judge to continue. mr. murray’s trial continuation fell squarely
in this category. the trial judge did not order this trial to continue, and
the may dates were vacated on april 28, 2021, when the matter was brought
forward. the matter was adjourned to may 12, 2021 to fix additional trial
dates, to make up the three vacated may trial dates.

on may 12, 2021, the matter was adjourned to
june 9, 2021 to permit finalizing the setting of replacement dates as well as
continuation dates.

on june 9, 2021, mr. fabris, counsel for mr.
murray, advised the court that he was not able to continue the trial starting
on july 20, 2021. the matter was adjourned to june 11, 2021 for a motion to
adjourn the trial dates. the june and july dates were vacated, and the matter
was adjourned to june 16, 2021. the adjournment was as a result of defence
counsel’s need for surgery. for some reason, august 24, 2021 was not endorsed
on the information as a trial date, and it was not vacated. it also appears
that august 24, 2021 did not take place as part of the trial.

the matter was adjourned one week from june 16,
2021 to june 23, 2021 to finalize the continuation dates. on june 23, 2021,
continuation dates were arranged for october 12, 13 and 14, 2021, but could not
be confirmed. the matter was adjourned to july 7, 2021 to confirm the dates. on
july 7, 2021 trial continuation dates of september 1 and 20, october 12, and
14, 22 and november 1, 2021 were confirmed. it was noted that defence was
offered october 13, 2021, but mr. fabris was not available.

the next date that the matter was addressed in court
was on september 1, 2021 for trial continuation. accordingly, regarding the
time between april 28 and september 1, 2021, five days were for trial, one day
is defence caused delay, and the period between is a discrete event. it was
first affected by the covid-19 directives, which prompted the adjournment of
the matter in may, and then the surgery of mr. fabris which prompted the
adjournment of the june and july trial dates. further, the august 24, 2021
date was never noted on the record as a continuation date. five days for trial
– and the period of time from the original anticipated completion time for
trial (15 days of trial completed on october 12, 2022). accordingly, the
period between october 12 and november 4, 2022 is split between the crown and
defence. accordingly, an additional 23 days for a total of 24 days, is defence
caused delay.
september 1, 2021 to november 4,
2021 – 63 days

on september 1, 2021 the trial recommenced and
day 13 was completed. it continued for all scheduled dates, until november 4,
2021. because mr. fabris was not available on october 13, 2021 and the court
and crown were available, one day will be noted as defence caused delay. in
the intervening time, additional dates were scheduled for november 3 and 4,
2021.

the remaining 62 days are part of the
jordan
framework.
november 4, 2021 to may 17, 2022 –
194 days

on november 4, 2021, the presiding justice was
not available to continue. it was noted on the record that counsel was seeking
an additional five days for trial, so six days had to be coordinated. the
matter was adjourned to november 24, 2021 to coordinate the additional dates. 
it was noted that the absence of the judge was unforeseen and unanticipated. it
was not noted for how long the judge was not going to be available.

the defence alleges that since there was no
information provided regarding the unavailability of the judge to continue,
there was an obligation on the crown to ameliorate this delay and, therefore,
the delay is “crown delay”. the crown correctly observes that there is no
obligation on the crown to pry into the reasons for which a judge is
“unavailable”, and the delay caused by the unavailability of the judge is
properly considered as a discrete event. regardless of the underlying reason,
the judge was not available to conduct the trial. her inability to continue
the trial on november 4, 2021 was unforeseen, and it caused the adjournment of
the trial to may 17, 2022.

emails show trial coordination offered may 17,
19, 30 and 31, june 2 and 9, 2022 as possible continuation dates. those dates
were accepted and all but may 31, 2022 was noted on the record on november 24,
2021. there is no explanation as to why may 31, 2022 was not noted. november
4, 2021 to may 16, 2022 is 194 days. this period is a discrete event, being
the judge was not available to continue the trial in the adjusted trial time. it
was noted that six more days were required being one day of the adjusted trial
time, and an estimated five additional days required to complete the trial.
may 17, 2022 to november 23, 2022 –
190 days

the defence acknowledges that the delay between
may 17, 2022 to november 23, 2022 is defence delay due to a request to
adjourn the trial on may 17, 2022 to accommodate a change of counsel. new
counsel attempted to resolve the matter, but ultimately sought new trial dates,
which were scheduled on november 23, 2022.

the crown agrees that the period between may 17,
2022 and november 22, 2022 is defence delay.

i have examined that period of time, and i agree
that this period of 190 days is defence caused delay.
november 23, 2022 to april 28, 2023 –
156 days

the next period of time, the defence claims is “court
delay”. the crown says the entire period is a “discrete event”.

the matter was adjourned to november 23, 2022 to
set continuation dates for the trial, after a change in counsel to mr. orazietti. 
there was a pending request to be removed as counsel by mr. orazietti, which
was abandoned. on november 23, 2022 the matter was set to may 1, 2, 4 and 5,
2023 for continuation. a confirmation hearing was set for march 7, 2023, at
which time the continuation dates were confirmed. ultimately, the matter was
brought forward on april 27, 2023.

it is important to note that earlier dates
for trial in may and june of 2022 had already been vacated due to a defence
request. but for that adjournment, mr. murray’s trial may have been
completed. then defence spent the next 156 days getting up to speed. trial
completion dates were scheduled. defence counsel had advised that he was not
fully retained, which the evidence supports caused the delay in scheduling trial
continuation dates. accordingly, i find that the period of time between
november 23, 2022 and april 27, 2023 or 156 days is defence caused delay. 
there is nothing in evidence to support that any of this period is due to a discrete
event.
april 28, 2023 to december 12, 2023 –
228 days

on april 28, 2023, the matter was brought
forward and the anticipated trial continuation dates were vacated, as the
presiding judge was unavailable.

the crown submits that between april 28, 2023
and june 1, 2023 is a discrete event due to the unavailability of the trial
judge. he argues that the balance of the time is due to defence caused delay. 
the defence says that the entire period is “court delay”.

after april 28, 2023 the matter was adjourned
several times, in part to determine if the judge would be available to
continue, and in part to attempt to resolve the matter. another judicial
pretrial was scheduled for october 3, 2023, and the matter was next returnable
in court on october 4, 2023. on october 4, 2023, the matter was adjourned to
october 26, 2023. on october 26, 2023, it was clear that the relationship
between mr. murray and his counsel had broken down, and mr. orazietti was
removed. the matter was then adjourned for a continuation of the trial on
december 12, 13, 14 and 15, 2023.

between april 28, 2023 and december 12, 2023, 228
days is a discrete event. it was caused entirely by the unavailability of the trial
judge to sit. a review of the email exchanges between crown, defence and trial
coordination shows that on april 28, 2023 the trial coordinator asked for counsel’s
availability in december of 2023 to continue the trial. i infer from this that
the trial judge was not going to be available to conduct this continuation
until december in any event.
december 12, 2023 to june 20, 2024 –
191 days

defence acknowledges that the period of time
between december 12, 2023 and february 7, 2024 was defence delay. the
remainder of the time is claimed as “crown delay” or “court delay”. the crown
claims that the period between december 12, 2023 and february 14, 2024 is
defence delay. the crown claims that the remainder of the time is a discrete event.

on december 12, 2023, mr. murray attended and
sought an adjournment to april of 2024, in order to fully retain mr. perrin. 
he had partially retained mr. perrin, but mr. perrin was not present, and
not prepared to continue the trial on that date. mr. murray advised that he
needed legal advice prior to waiving his 11(b) right, and the matter was
adjourned to january 24, 2024.

it was adjourned again to february 7, 2024 to coordinate
continuation dates. a lawyer from mr. sheikh’s office attended on february 7,
2024 and requested an adjournment.

on february 14, 2024 the matter was adjourned to
june 20, 2024 for the anticipated one further day for the crown’s case. the
defence anticipated calling evidence on july 4, 8 and 11, 2024.

the entire period between december 12, 2023 and
june 20, 2024 is clearly defence caused delay. mr. murray requested the
adjournment on december 12, 2023 so that he could retain new counsel. he had
not yet retained counsel by that date, and in fact, had only retained mr.
shaikh’s office as of february 14, 2024. mr. peters, who attended, said that
he needed time to review 6 banker’s boxes of materials in order to continue the
trial. but for mr. murray’s request, the trial may have completed in the allotted
time. his new counsel was not even retained until february of 2024, and he
clearly required time to prepare and review the transcripts, so that the trial
could continue. 191 days is defence delay.
june 20, 2024 to july 11, 2024 – 21
days

june 20, 2024 was conducted as a trial continuation. mr. s. peters
attended on behalf of mr. sheikh and conducted the trial continuation. july 4,
2024 was the argument of the crown’s similar fact application. justice serre reserved
her decision, and the trial continued on july 4 and july 8, and july 11, 2024. there
is no dispute that this is inherent trial time.
july 11, 2024 to december 16, 2024 –
158 days

the crown claims that this period is a discrete event. the defence
says that entire period is “court delay” or “crown delay”.

on july 11, 2024, the crown observed that continuation dates were
being explored with trial coordination, and dates were being offered in march
of 2025. the court and the crown expressed concern with that, and the matter
was adjourned to august 28, 2024 to attempt to coordinate earlier continuation
dates.

on august 28, 2024, earlier dates were scheduled for december 17,
18, 19 and 20, 2024. a speak-to date was set for september 18, 2024 to confirm
the december trial continuation dates.

on september 18, 2024, the matter was adjourned to october 2, 2024
to confirm the december dates, as well as two additional dates. on october 2,
2024, an agent for mr. sheikh indicated that another lawyer in his firm had
been assigned, confirmed december 17, 18 and 19, 2024 as well as february 13
and 14, 2025 as additional trial dates, and was looking to schedule another day
in order to complete the trial. on october 23, 2024 additional dates of march
10 and 11, 2025 were confirmed. the matter was adjourned to december 17, 2024
to continue the trial.

july 12, 2024 to december 16, 2024 is solely attributed to the underestimation
of trial time – 156 days. the crown’s case was complete. the defence case had
commenced. the original trial estimate was three weeks, and the effects of a
remote trial slowed the trial down. however, the effect of an underestimation
of trial cannot be completely explained by remote attendances. there was a
serious underestimation of required trial time, even exceeding the original trial
estimate while mr. murray was a self‑represented accused. each party has
to bear the effect of this serious underestimation and, accordingly, i
apportion this time between crown and defence. accordingly, i attribute 79
days to the crown and 79 days to the defence.
december 16, 2024 to june 2, 2025 –
168 days

the crown says that this period of time is due to a discrete event,
or defence waiver. the defence says that the entire time is court delay,
except between february 5, 2025 and august 15, 2025, which may be
characterized as either a discrete event or “court delay”.

on december 16, 2024, the matter was brought forward because the presiding
justice was not available to continue the trial, and the december dates were
vacated. the matter was adjourned to february 5, 2025 as a check-in date. at
that time, the next dates to be scheduled were february 13, 14, may 5, 6, 8 and
26, 2025. march dates were available, but the crown was not. february 13 and
14, 2025 were confirmed as trial continuation dates.

on february 5, 2025, counsel was advised that the presiding justice
was not able to continue the trial, and by order of the chief justice, pursuant
to s. 669.2(3), the trial was to restart before another judge. mr. o’brodovich
appeared, and indicated that he was assisting counsel of record, mr. sheikh. 
another judicial pretrial was set for february 10, 2025. mr. murray was
given the option of having a new judge simply review the transcripts of
evidence, rather than start the trial over again.

the matter was adjourned to march 5, 2025, to confirm new trial
dates, and the february dates were vacated.

on march 5, 2025, new trial dates were scheduled, to commence on
june 2, 2025 and complete on august 15, 2025, for a total of 32 days. for the
first time, there is mention of an anticipated 11(b) application. earlier
dates commencing on april 1 up to may 30, 2025 and june 6 and june 13, 2025
were offered, but defence counsel was not available on those dates. defence
counsel anticipated that the bulk of the evidence would go in by way of
transcript, but did not confirm. a continuing jpt was scheduled to take place
on april 2 and the matter was returnable in court for the first day of trial on
june 2, 2025.

december 17, 2024 to june 1, 2025 is a discrete event – 168 days. 
the delay is caused entirely due to the unavailability to the trial judge to
continue the trial, and the need to coordinate a judge to sit for an additional
32 days, in order to continue the trial. it is somewhat miraculous that the trial
continuation was scheduled as quickly as it was, and all parties are to be commended
for working as quickly as they did in order to get this trial restarted and
finished within the timeframe.
june 2, 2025
to august 15, 2025 – 75 days to complete the evidence

the trial was completed during this time. it
necessitated that all of the evidence, except the evidence regarding the
investigating officer’s evidence be recalled. one day was lost due to my
unavailability, one day was lost due to mr. murray being ill, and we finished
early on two dates. as well, for reasons unknown, trial coordination in
sudbury assigned trial dates for five dates for which i was not available. i
made myself available on one of those dates, but the others had to be vacated. 
after discussion with all counsel and court personnel, we started court at 9:00
a.m., and only took one hour for lunch each day in june and for most of the
days in august. in that way, we were able to make up significant time for time
that would have been lost. i am grateful for all participants being flexible
and in ensuring that the evidence in this matter could be completed within the
scheduled time. pending this decision, the parties have scheduled october 9,
2025 to argue the merits of the crown’s case.

after the above assessment was completed, i have
calculated the total delay attributable to the defence as 693 days.

i have calculated the total delay caused by the
combination of discrete events to be 1,002 days.

accordingly, the calculation pursuant to the
jordan
framework is as follows:
total delay: 2,264
days
less defence
caused delay: 693 days
net delay: 1,571
days
less discrete
events: 1,002 days
remaining delay: 
 569 days

in
r. v. jordan, the supreme court
determined that any delay over 18 months or a total of 548 days, is
presumptively a breach of the right of the accused to be tried within a
reasonable time, pursuant to s. 11(b) of the
charter of rights and freedoms. 
as the remaining delay is 569 days, or 21 days in excess of 18 months, mr.
murray has succeeded in establishing that his right pursuant to s. 11(b) has
been violated. pursuant to s. 24(2), i will enter a stay of proceedings as
the remedy for the breach of mr. murray’s right.
released: september 19,
