schwarzl, j.:
reasons for sentence
1.0: introduction
[
1.]
following a trial, i found the offender, d.s., guilty of all
nine counts on information 23-349. verdicts and reasons were rendered on
september 12, 2024. those crimes were committed against his stepchildren, e.a.
and a.s.
[
2.]
on january 15, 2025, a sentencing hearing was held. at that
time, i stayed counts 1, 4, 6, and 8 at the request of both counsel. convictions
were registered on one count of sexual assault, s. 271 ccc (count 3) and four
counts of sexual interference, s.151 ccc (counts 2, 5, 7 and 9). submissions
were made in relation to these five offences.
[
3.]
a pre-sentence report (psr) was filed as were victim impact
statements from e.a. and her cousin j.g. a.s. declined to provide a statement.
[
4.]
the
crown submits that a global sentence of 4½ years in the penitentiary is
appropriate.
[
5.]
the defence submits that a global sentence of 2 years less a
day to be served via a conditional sentence order (cso) with full house arrest
is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
[
6.]
the parties jointly agree that the following ancillary orders
be made on each count, namely: a 20-year soira order; a s.109 firearms
prohibition; a primary dna order; and a lifetime s.161 prohibition order.
2.0: circumstances of the offences
2.1: the offences against e.a. (counts 2
and 3)
[
7.]
e.a. was born in 1992.
[
8.]
when she was between 13 and 14 years of age, the offender
snuck into her bedroom one night and touched her buttocks over her clothes. 
she was so alarmed that she slept with a knife for protection in case he tried
to do it again (count 2).
[
9.]
when e.a. was between 15 and 17 years of age, the offender
slapped her buttocks over her pants a few times, usually while he was
intoxicated and always at the family home (count 3).
[
10.]
when these
crimes against e.a. were committed, the offender was between 46 and 51 years of
age.
2.2: the offences against a.s. (counts 5,
7, and 9)
[
11.]
a.s.
was born in 2001. all the offences against her were
committed at home.
[
12.]
on one
occasion when a.s. was between 8 and 12 years old, the offender touched her
chest and vagina over her clothes while they were snowmobiling (count 5).
[
13.]
on two
occasions, the offender touched a.s. by approaching her from the rear in the
kitchen and rubbing her inner thighs (count 7). she was between 8 and 13 at
the time.
[
14.]
several
times when a.s. was between 8 and 12 years old, the offender touched her vagina
and clitoris under her clothes whilst watching television with her on the couch
(count 9).
[
15.]
when he
molested a.s., the offender was between 49 and 54 years of age.
3.0: circumstances of the offender
[
16.]
d.s. was
born on december 8, 1959 in quebec. he is presently 65 years old. he is a
canadian citizen who comes before the court as a first offender.
[
17.]
he is the
middle child of five siblings. he presently lives with his younger sister, p.l.
and her husband, as well as with his younger brother, g., in mansfield quebec. 
his sister is one of few family members aware of this case and she provides him
with strong emotional support.
[
18.]
the offender
assists his sister as a caretaker for g., who is paralyzed on one side of his
body. in exchange for his help, the offender lives rent free in part because his
only income is a very meagre pension.
[
19.]
prior to
moving back to quebec, the offender had been in a long-term relationship with
the victims’ mother and is the stepfather to her children. prior to that, he
was married to another woman and has four children from that union.
[
20.]
the offender
has a grade six education and has worked nearly his entire life until leaving
ontario. while he was living with the victims and their mother, the offender
provided them full financial support. at trial, he was described as a generous
and often kind stepfather although e.a. disliked him and kept her distance from
him.
[
21.]
throughout
the relevant times of these offences, the offender was a heavy drinker. alcohol
was a significant element in the commission of many of the offences. at
present, he does not drink much and does not use drugs.
[
22.]
the offender
denies committing the offences of which he has been convicted. at the
sentencing hearing he told me, “i am innocent; that’s all i know.”
[
23.]
the psr
assesses that the offender is at a low risk of reoffending provided he has
someone to monitor his activities and the company he keeps.
[
24.]
the offender
has complied with all terms of bail since being charged several years ago.
4.0: analysis
4.1: victim impact
[
25.]
a.s.
declined to give a victim impact statement. when she gave evidence at the
trial, she made it clear that while the conduct of the offender was wrong, she
has forgiven him. after these offences, and while she was still in high
school, she lived with the offender and was not afraid that he would molest her
again. that said, the offender was in a position of trust towards a.s. during
the relevant times and he violated that duty when he committed these offences.
[
26.]
the impact
on e.a. is palpable, deep, and long lasting. despite her emotional distance
from the offender while they lived together, these crimes have left an
indelible stain on her sense of security and trust. she suffers continual
stress and anxiety due to these crimes. she feels unsafe in public and is
hypervigilant in fear that she might see the offender on the street.
[
27.]
j.g. was not
a named victim but was a resident family member when some of the offences
occurred. she was also witness to behaviour by the offender that, while not
criminal, was certainly sexually inappropriate. it is not necessary to discuss
that behaviour here as i reviewed it thoroughly in my reasons for judgment. 
the impact on j.g. is that she has had to deal with divisions and tensions
within the family and suffers from persistent anxiety and loss of trust as a
result.
4.2: mitigating, aggravating, and other
relevant factors
[
28.]
mitigating
factors present in this case including the following:
(a)
the offender is a
mature adult and first-time offender;
(b)
he has complied with
all conditions of his release over several years;
(c)
he has strong, albeit
it limited, family support;
(d)
there is no evidence of
grooming; and
(e)
the offender’s risk of
recidivism is low.
[
29.]
there are
aggravating factors in this case, including:
(a)
there are two victims;
(b)
he molested each victim
more than once;
(c)
the duration of the
offences spanned years;
(d)
the offences all
occurred at home, which is a primary place of physical and psychological
safety;
(e)
the victims were both
members of his family: s.718.2(a)(ii) ccc;
(f)
each victim
was under 18 years of age when the crimes were committed: s.718.12(a)(ii.1) ccc;
(g)
the age disparity
between offender and victims was enormous;
(h)
there is significant
victim impact on e.a.: s.718.2(a)(iii.1) ccc;
(i)
the offence
against a.s. that happened on the couch involved a significant level of
physical intrusion;
(j)
the degree
of moral blameworthiness and responsibility of the offender for these offences
could not be higher; and
(k)
the crimes involved an
abuse of his position of trust as a parental figure to both victims: 
s.718.2(a)(iii) ccc.
[
30.]
i disagree
with the defence that there was no breach of trust vis-à-vis e.a. just because
she considered him to be more like a friend than a father figure to her, the
evidence established that as a provider to her of shelter, family trips, and as
co-occupant of the home, he carried with him a duty of care and moral
obligation to ensure that e.a. was safe from harm so long as she was a child
living under his roof. his predations clearly breached his duty of trust
towards e.a.:
r. v. aird,
2013 onca 447;
r. v. m.m.,
2022 onca
441.
[
31.]
another
relevant consideration on sentence is the collateral consequence of
incarceration on the offender’s ability to act as a caregiver to his disabled
brother. this collateral consequence is not unique. the prospect of family
disruption is true for all offenders with families, whether or not they are
caregivers. that said, the separation of this offender from his family will negatively
impact his ability to care for his disabled brother and is therefore an
appropriate consideration provided that the sentence imposed remains
proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the responsibility of the
offender:
r. v. l.c.,
2022 onca 863.
4.3: whether a cso is appropriate in this case
[
32.]
the defence
submits that a conditional sentence order is appropriate in this case. they
acknowledge that the supreme court of canada’s
judgment in
r. v. friesen,
2020 scc 9
states that penitentiary sentences for sex crimes against children should
not be the norm. that said,
friesen
did not exclude the availability of
conditional sentences where the appropriate sentence is under two years in
exceptional circumstances:
r. v. m.m.,
2022 onca 441; r. v. b.m.
2023
onca 224; r. v. a.l.,
2025 onca 9
at para.
16 to 21.
[
33.]
i must decide
whether a global sentence of less than two years is fit in this case. if it
is, then i must consider whether exceptional circumstances exist to justify a
conditional sentence in the face of sex crimes against children. the phrase
“exceptional circumstances” is shorthand for personal circumstances and
mitigating factors that are sufficiently compelling to make a conditional
sentence proportionate:
r. v. pike,
2024 onca 608, at
para.
182. multiple seemingly non-exceptional factors taken together can
collectively render a conditional sentence proportionate:
pike, at
para.
182.
[
34.]
the defence
provided several precedents where sentences under two years were imposed both
pre- and post-
friesen:
r. v. fulford,
2024 onsc 4901;
r. v.
gunaratnam, supra.;
r. v. p.s.,
2021 onsc 5091, amongst others. in most
of the cases provided by the defence, they involved such elements as (a)
offenders with serious health conditions (such as delayed mental development or
parkinson’s disease), (b) remorse being shown, and (c) a joint submission in
one case. none of these elements are present in the case at bar and are therefore
distinguishable.
[
35.]
the case
authorities cited by the crown, while not on all fours with the facts here, demonstrate
that penitentiary sentences are fit in circumstances not too different from these
offences and this offender.
[
36.]
upon
considering the submissions of counsel, the guidance of the supreme court, ontario
court of appeal, and all the lower court cases provided about sentencing in
child sex crimes, i am of the view that the appropriate global sentence in the
circumstances of these crimes and this offender exceeds two years. therefore,
a conditional sentence is not available to the offender in this case.
[
37.]
even if a
cso were available, i would not find any exceptional circumstances that would
justify anything other than a carceral sentence in this case. while his
incarceration will make it harder on the rest of the family to look after his
brother, there was no submission that his absence will make this task
untenable. no other exceptional circumstances were presented for
consideration. nor are the overarching principles of denunciation and
deterrence adequately addressed by a cso in the circumstances here.
4.4: the appropriate sentence
[
38.]
balancing all
the relevant mitigating, aggravating, and other features such as the collateral
consequence of being unable to care for his brother, i find that a just global
custodial sentence in this case is 40 months broken down as follows:
(a)
count 2, s. 151 ccc: 6
months;
(b)
count 3, s. 271 ccc: 8
months, consecutive to count 1;
(c)
count 7, s. 151 ccc: 26
months, consecutive to counts 1 and 2;
(d)
count 5, s. 151 ccc: 
12 months, concurrent to count 7; and
(e)
count 9, s. 151 ccc: 8
months, concurrent to count 7.
[
39.]
the
ancillary orders agreed to by the parties shall also issue.
[
40.]
an order
shall issue under s.743.21(1) of the
code
naming e.a., a.s., and j.g.
[
41.]
given the
offender’s limited personal finances, the victim surcharges are waived on all
counts.
