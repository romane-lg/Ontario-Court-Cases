introduction

this case arises from a tragic collision on july 26, 2019, on highway
407 near the kinsale road overpass in the city of pickering in the region of
durham ontario. the collision involved a white dodge caliber driven by madison
sprayson eastbound. this vehicle also contained johnathan walker – clements in
the front passenger seat and riley wamboldt in the rear driver side seat.

the collision occurred at approximately 8:13 p.m. under clear weather
conditions. witness accounts and evidence indicated light to moderate traffic
at the time.

the driver of the caliber was travelling at a high rate of speed and
lost control of the vehicle and crossed the median into westbound lanes.

while crossing the median the vehicle overturned several times before
colliding with a grey honda accord occupied by mr. and mrs. gruben, traveling
in the westbound lanes of the 407 highway.

the collision resulted in the death of riley nicholas wamboldt, a
21-year-old rear-seat passenger in the dodge caliber, and significant injuries
to mr. and mrs. gruben the occupants of the westbound honda accord.

on january 14
th
2025 madison sprayson was found guilty of one
(1) charges of
careless driving causing death
under
section 130(3)
of
the
ontario highway traffic act
(hta)

two (2) charges of
careless driving causing bodily harm
under
section 130(3)
of the
ontario highway traffic act
(hta)

mr. riley wamboldt was in the rear seat of ms. madison sprayson’s dodge
motor vehicle at the time of the collision. mr. riley wamboldt sustained
significant blunt force trauma from the collision. mr. riley wamboldt died from
the blunt force trauma caused by this collision.

the collision involved a second motor vehicle – a honda. the honda was
being driven by mr. keith gruben. his wife, ms. mary-lou gruben, was a
passenger in the honda motor vehicle at the time of the collision as well.

mr.
keith gruben suffered injuries from this collision. these injuries include but
are not limited to: broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

ms.
mary-lou gruben suffered injuries from this collision. these injuries include,
but are not limited to: broken ribs, cervical/vertebrae fractures, 1 lumbar
fracture, a broken arm, a broken ankle, a laceration to her pelvic region, ptsd
and anxiety. her cervical fracture required her to wear a neck brace for 3
months 24 hours a day. she was in hospital for 3 months and when she returned
home was confined to a wheelchair and hospital bed for several more months.
the crown’s cases

in
support of their submissions the crown submitted the following cases
(1)
r v. biggar,
2024 oncj 23
(2)
r v. henry,
2023 oncj 273
(3)
r v. ingram,

(4)
r v. miller,
2023 oncj 77
(5)
r v. lake,
2023 oncj 452
the crown’s submissions

the
crown submits that this is a case that calls for a strong and unequivocal
message from this court a message of denunciation, specific and general
deterrence, and, above all, public protection. seeking a sentence of:
(1)
18 months imprisonment;
(2)
a 5-year driving prohibition;
(3)
24 months of probation upon release; and
(4)
an order for 250 hours of community service

these
sanctions are necessary, proportional, and just. this was not a case of
momentary inattention or an isolated lapse in judgment. the driving behavior
was prolonged, deliberate, and egregious. this accused made a series of
high-risk choices: speeding, overtaking multiple vehicles, and continuing to
drive recklessly both before and after the incident

in
the week prior, she was charged with careless driving. post-offence, she was
again caught speeding. that shows a pattern, not a one-time mistake. she did
not just fail to learn she refused to change.

above
and beyond the death of riley wamboldt there are severely injured victims in
this matter, and their suffering is substantial and ongoing.

these
victims’ pain cannot and should not be overshadowed by the tragic loss of
riley. each person’s injuries deserve full recognition.

we’ve
also heard four powerful victim impact statements from the family: taylor
wambolt, amber sloan, laura chapman, and barry wamboldt. their grief is
profound and permanent. in their words, this tragedy is a "continual sentence"
for them

what’s
deeply troubling here is the offender’s continued denial and lack of
accountability.

the
pre-sentence report paints a concerning picture of narcissistic trait; a victim
mentality, and minimization of her own conduct.

she
said,
“i would never have done anything wrong,”
and emphasized her fear
of losing her licence over the harm she caused.

she
failed to acknowledge even her basic driving record — a record that clearly
shows multiple infractions. she claimed to be a "good driver," even after
reviewing her own history. this is someone who, even now, does not accept
responsibility. she distances herself from the truth. she has shown no remorse.
that makes specific deterrence essential.

unlike
other offenders who pled guilty and accepted blame, this individual remains in
denial.
ingram,
henry, and
biggar
all reinforce the need
for a sentence that protects the public from repeat conduct and sends a clear
message to those who drive with such disregard for human life.

ms
sprayson is young and there is time ahead of her. but rehabilitation is not the
priority in this case. as the court has heard this is not apples-to-apples with
other cases. this offender's mindset sets her apart. until there is a reckoning
with what she did, rehabilitation cannot begin.

while
incarceration and a driving ban are critical, the crown is also asking for 250
hours of community service. this follows
biggar’s
emphasis on giving
back to the community. it allows the offender to begin repaying the harm she has
caused in a tangible way.

this
sentence must reflect the seriousness of what happened, the pain of those
affected, and the ongoing risk this offender poses.

there
is no precedent for a case with this combination of facts. one person deceased.
two other seriously injured victims, a continuing pattern of driving offenses,
and an accused who denies it all.

the
crown characterizes the driving as
prolonged, dangerous conduct
involving
overtaking vehicles at high speed. it is submitted that this is not a case of
momentary distraction, but of
calculated risk-taking
resulting in
foreseeable tragedy.

the
crown highlights the accused’s
extensive driving record: prior speeding
offences, including violations both before and after the collision. multiple
licence suspensions
suggest, in the crown’s view, a
pattern of recidivism
and
lack of respect for
road safety.

the
crown respectfully submits that 18 months in custody, a 5-year driving
prohibition, 24 months’ probation, and 250 hours of community service are the
necessary consequences here.
the defence’s cases

in
support of their submissions defence submitted the following cases
(1)
r. v. defreitas,
2020 oncj 90
(2)
r. v. stupar, 2015 oncl350

the defence’s submissions

counsel
for the defence submits that the appropriate disposition for ms. madison
sprayson, convicted of careless driving causing death and bodily harm under the
highway traffic act, is a non-custodial sentence, proportionate to her
moral blameworthiness and the regulatory nature of the offence.

the
defence respectfully proposes:
(1)
a fine in the amount of $5,000;
(2)
a term of two (2) years of probation, with standard conditions;
(3)
no licence suspension, given her unique personal and professional
obligations; or, in the alternative,
(4)
a custodial sentence not exceeding 10 to 15 days, served intermittently.

at
the time of the offence, ms. sprayson was 21 years old, and she has remained in
legal limbo throughout her twenties.

she
is a single mother to her daughter, betty. she does however evenly split her
parenting duties with the betty’s father. their parenting arrangement allows ms
sprayson to have custody of betty on a rotating basis and allows betty to
attend her school which is in the town her father lives in. the imposition of
a custodial term or driving suspension would significantly impair her ability
to meet betty’s needs and maintain stability in their lives.

ms.
sprayson is the sole proprietor of a rural animal rehabilitation and rehoming
operation. her business facilitates the care of approximately 500 animals per
year, including the use of specialized medical devices for large animals. the
business is travel-dependent and not replaceable within her region.

she
has built this business independently from a young age, beginning with a tack
store at 15, followed by a horse barn, and eventually a full animal
rehabilitation facility. she is one of the few providers of such services in northumberland
county.

the
defence submits that the loss of her driving privileges or a prolonged period
of custody would result in the collapse of her business, inability to provide
for her child, and likely death or suffering of animals under her care.

ms.
sprayson sustained significant psychological harm from the incident, having
lost a close friend, riley wamboldt. she continues to mourn the loss, has
recurring nightmares, and was not permitted to attend riley’s funeral, a fact
that continues to affect her.

she
honours riley’s memory annually, which reflects a form of remorse and emotional
processing, albeit not conventionally articulated.

ms.
sprayson has no prior criminal record. while she has previous driving
infractions, the defence notes that many infractions were minor speeding
tickets (under 20 km/h over). she has incurred no new driving infractions for
over two years.

past
licence suspensions were administrative in nature and linked to late fine
payments, not to unsafe driving. she paid all fines associated with past
offences, demonstrating responsibility and compliance. the defence submits that
these factors weigh against a need for specific deterrence.

the
defence emphasizes that careless driving causing death is a regulatory offence,
not a criminal one, and is governed by the sentencing principles applicable to
strict liability offences.

the
court is urged to follow the sentencing guidance set out in:
•
r v miller,
2019 oncj 760, at paras
56–63, confirming the primary
objectives in
hta
sentencing are deterrence, rehabilitation, and
proportionality, not punishment;
•
r v defreitas,
2022 oncj 313, para
30, indicating that custodial
sentences are not mandatory in such matters;
•
r v stupar,
2021 oncj 219, paras
39–41, affirming that the fault
element for careless driving lies in momentary lapses, not intentional or
grossly negligent conduct.
the principle of parity must also be respected.
comparable cases include.
•
r v miller: 45-day sentence for texting while driving and causing
death.
•
r v bertram (
2023 oncj 236
): 14 days’ custody for striking a
cyclist.
•
r v ingram: 75 days for crossing a yellow line and causing death
with moral blameworthiness far higher than in the present case.
•
r v hiebert, r v bannister, and others: fines and probation, not
custody, imposed for comparable offences.

these
authorities collectively suggest that sentences for
hta
careless driving
causing death or bodily harm are measured in days, and custodial terms are rare
for first-time offenders with no criminal history.
response to crown
submissions

the
defence acknowledges the tragic consequences of the collision. however, it is
submitted that the crown’s reliance on post-incident psr observations must be
viewed with caution. the accused’s emotional affect, while guarded, is
consistent with trauma and grief and not, per se, a lack of remorse.

there
is no evidence of alcohol, substance use, or intentional harm, and while the
driving involved speed and passing, there is no indication of prolonged,
egregious recklessness akin to the conduct in ingram or similar cases.

the
crown's suggested 18-month custodial sentence is unprecedented in the
jurisprudence for
hta
matters, particularly given the regulatory nature of the
offence, and would constitute a disproportionate response contrary to
section
718.1
of the
criminal code of canada.

considering
the foregoing, the defence submits that a just, fair, and proportionate
sentence would be:

a
fine of $5,000,

two
(2) years’ probation,

no
driving suspension,

or,
alternatively, if the court deems custody necessary, a short custodial term not
exceeding 10–15 days, potentially to be served intermittently.

such
a sentence would reflect the principles of denunciation, specific deterrence,
rehabilitation, and proportionality, while avoiding the undue collateral
consequences that would flow from a more severe sentence.

victim impact statements

during
the sentencing hearing, the court was presented with victim impact statements
from members of the wamboldt family, offering profound insight into the
devastating human cost of this tragedy. statements were read on behalf of four
family members: taylor wamboldt, the sister of riley wamboldt; amber sloan, a
cousin; laura chapman, riley’s mother; and barry wamboldt, riley’s father.
these voices represented only a portion of the broader grief experienced, as
the prosecution submitted a total of twenty-six (26) victim impact statements,
each a powerful testament to the far-reaching emotional and psychological
repercussions of the loss.

the
statements provided by members of riley wamboldt’s immediate and extended
family, as well as his lifelong friends, collectively revealed a portrait of a
young life deeply cherished and irreplaceably lost. they painted a picture of a
vibrant individual whose absence now leaves an unfillable void in the lives of those
who knew and loved him.

among
those who shared their suffering were keith and mary-lou gruben, the occupants
of the second vehicle involved in the collision. their victim impact statements
vividly conveyed the extensive trauma they endured—not only in terms of their
physical injuries, but also the profound financial and emotional toll this
incident has taken on their lives.

no
words uttered in this courtroom can undo the pain that has been inflicted or
restore what has been taken. the grief borne by this community is immeasurable,
and the sorrow articulated by those who came forward to share their stories
resonates deeply. what this court can offer is its solemn recognition that
every statement submitted has been carefully read, deeply felt, and respectfully
acknowledged. the courage it took to confront this pain and speak these truths
before the court is not lost. on behalf of this institution, i extend heartfelt
thanks to each person who bravely voiced their anguish, ensuring that riley’s
life, and the lasting impact of his loss, are fully honoured within these
proceedings.
the offender

at
the time of the collision, ms. madison sprayson was 21 years old. she was
convicted on all three charges brought before the court. as a result, a
pre-sentence report (psr) was commissioned and completed on 3 april 2025,
offering a comprehensive overview of her personal circumstances. the report
delves into her familial and personal background, education, work history,
substance use, and general disposition.

the
psr characterizes ms. sprayson as maintaining a positive and cooperative
relationship with her former partner, sharing equal custody of their daughter—a
role she appears to take seriously. she is depicted as highly motivated and
hardworking, having launched multiple business ventures during her late teenage
years and early twenties. presently, her primary focus lies in animal
rehabilitation, an area where she displays both passion and dedication. these
are certainly mitigating circumstances.

with
respect to substance use, ms. sprayson reported low alcohol consumption but
admitted to daily marihuana use through a bong over the past five years. she
explained that this use assists her with sleep and helps alleviate chronic
lower back pain.

the
use of marihuana even though it has not ever been raised as a factor in the
collision has been a theme throughout the proceedings. evidence of smoking
prior to the collision and a bong was found in the vehicle after the collision.

the
tone of the report notably shifts when addressing her character, behaviour, and
attitude. it is highlighted that ms. sprayson postponed her original psr
interview scheduled for 26 february 2025, citing uncertainty over the report’s
necessity due to a pending appeal. this delay prompted concerns regarding her
attitude toward the legal process and her overall level of engagement.

the
report includes multiple sections that raise concerns for both the reporting
officer and the court, particularly regarding ms. sprayson’s acknowledgment of
her situation and her acceptance of responsibility for the incident.

in
the psr, in response to the charges, the subject expressed that she's been
going through this for nearly 6 years and stated, “i feel absolutely defeated i
honestly don't even have the words. coming from a standpoint where i know i
would have never done something so stupid.”

she
noted a relatively clean driving record apart from hitting a deer and receiving
speeding tickets. she stated, “other than that i have never had an issue i am
not a reckless person i know i did an irresponsible thing in the past when i
got a speeding ticket and i can own that, and i paid a fine, but i don't risk
people's lives.”

during
the interview, ms. sprayson also spoke about her relationship with mr. wamboldt
and his family, mentioning that she was not permitted to attend his funeral.
she described their relationship as akin to that of siblings. she further
shared, “he didn't like my boyfriend at the time and told me to leave i will
regret for the rest of my life that i didn't listen to him i have to live with
that but i would never risked my best friend's safety or others you don't just
drive along and all of a sudden veer off the road you just don't.”

concerning
therapy, the probation officer recorded the following in the psr: ms. sprayson
reported having attempted therapy following the accident. she stated, “my mom
and dad were the ones who set it up and i went to appease them. i did about 3
or 4 sessions and it wasn't for me.”

as part of the psr, daniel pearce—identified in the report as a friend
of the subject—was interviewed. he made the following statement:
“maddie is a good driver, i've been in the passenger seat with her plenty of
times before and she is very alert and focused when driving and she doesn't
speed. i don't believe she would have ever put a friend at risk. i know a lot
of people were affected by the crash, but it was hard on her as well, she lost
a best friend and when she drives with passengers now she really has to trust
the person, especially if they are in the front passenger seat. i think that
must be a trauma response from what she has experienced. maddie cares way too
much about people to ever put someone she loves in danger.”

in
the assessment section of the psr, the probation officer states:
“ultimately, the subject
expressed profound sorrow regarding the incident, the injuries sustained, and
the loss of her best friend. however, she did not assume responsibility for the
offence, emphasizing that she was found guilty rather than pleading guilty. she
did not acknowledge any personal wrongdoing leading to the accident and
attributed fault to her passenger.”
the subject appears motivated to move forward and spends her
time in a constructive manner. regarding the possibility of community
supervision, she remarked, “i have no issues with it in general i am a
compliant person but i do not think that's necessary for this case.”

the
final sentence of the assessment section of the psr concludes: “the subject
does not seem suitable for community supervision based on her statements of not
being able to participate in the potential requirements.”

analysis

when
considering the appropriate and just sentence in this matter the court has
considered at length the submissions of both counsel. it is clear that the
predominant principals being argued are those of parity, restraint, specific
and general deterrence and also denunciation.
parity

the principle of parity mandates that similar offenders who commit
similar offences under similar circumstances should receive similar sentences.
parity promotes consistency and fairness across the justice system, fostering
public confidence in its administration. while parity requires comparative
consistency, it does not necessitate identical sentences; individual factors
relating to the offender, or the offence may justify departures.

the
parity principle does not require that the sentences given to persons who
commit the same crime be the same – the parity principle requires that the
differences be understandable.
r. v. choquette
2010 onca 327 (canlii), o.j. no. 1851
(c.a.)

the
supreme court of canada in
r. v. lacasse,
2015 scc 64
at paras.
57 and
58
(a sentencing involving criminal driving offences):
 tariffs differ
from sentencing ranges in that tariff‑based sentencing is theoretically
the opposite of sentence individualization, which the ranges allow: thomas, at
p. 8. on the other hand, the principle underlying the two approaches is
the same: ensuring that offenders who have committed similar crimes in similar
circumstances are given similar sentences. the same is true of the starting‑point
approach, which is used mainly in alberta but sometimes also in other canadian
provinces:
r. v. mcdonnell,
1997 canlii 389 (scc), 1
s.c.r. 948, at para.
69. ultimately, whatever mechanism or terminology is
used, the principle on which it is based remains the same. where sentencing
ranges are concerned, although they are used mainly to ensure the parity of
sentences, they reflect all the principles and objectives of sentencing.
sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum
sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as guides for the
application of all the relevant principles and objectives. however, they should
not be considered “averages”, let alone straitjackets, but should instead be
seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still
exercise their discretion in each case:
even when an appellate court has established a range, it
may be that a fact pattern will arise, which is sufficiently dissimilar to past
decisions that the “range”, as it were, must be expanded. the fundamental point
is that a “range” is not a straitjacket to the exercise of discretion of a
sentencing judge.
(
r. v. keepness,
2010
skca 69,
359 sask. r. 34, at para.
24
)
 there will always be
situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range: although
ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the fact that
each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique
profile cannot be disregarded. the determination of a just and appropriate
sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely
mathematical calculation. it involves a variety of factors that are difficult
to define with precision. this is why it may happen that a sentence that, on
its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have been
imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit.

the fact pattern in this case has numerous differences from many of
the cases presented to the court by both crown and defence. the lack of
acceptance of responsibility at every turn of the process sets this matter
apart from each of the cases presented. even though ms. sprayson’s driving may
not appear to be as egregious as some the continued lack of acknowledgement and
shifting of blame to the front passenger is an aggravating factor in this case.

despite a finding of guilt ms. sprayson continues to blame the
passenger in the vehicle for the collision. despite her extreme driving record
she continues to state she is a good driver. despite two prior convictions for
careless driving she continues to state she does not put people at risk. one of
these careless driving convictions stemmed from an incident on july 12
th
2019. this accident that took the life of riley wamboldt and forever changed
the lives mr. and mrs. gruben on july 26
th
2019.

i am careful in these circumstances when examining the perceived
lack of remorse of ms. sprayson. the crown touched on this during submission. as
outlined in
r. v. j.s.
2018 onca 675,
 o.j. no. 4095
). lack of remorse
may be relevant on sentencing regarding the offender’s lack of insight or risk
of re-offending. however,
lack of
remorse is never an aggravating factor
on sentence, however it could be acknowledged as an absence of a
mitigating factor.

in most of the cases filed by both crown
and defence the expression of remorse and a related guilty plea factored as a
mitigating circumstance. neither of those exist in this case.

when examination of parity is conducted very
recent cases can be examined for guidance.,
the court of appeal very recently
in
r. v. perry,
2025 onca 241, referring to
lacasse, found that there was no
fixed range when it came to length of driving prohibition that could be imposed
under the
criminal code.
in
perry, a lifetime prohibition was
imposed; offender tried to point to other cases to suggest that aspect of the
penalty was outside the normal range:
 i am not
persuaded that these cases establish a fixed range for driving prohibitions or
render the sentence unfit. the applicable caselaw reveals a wide range in the
length of custodial sentences and driving prohibitions imposed in similar
cases. these ranges should be treated as guidelines, and not “hard and fast
rules”:
lacasse, at para.
60. this shows the individualized
nature of sentencing for each offender and the degree of discretion accorded to
the sentencing judge.
further in the recent
sentencing decision where the defendant was found guilty of careless driving
cause death, r v. williams-cordeiro
2025 oncj 120, her worship examines
many of the same cases submitted by counsel. at para 46,47,49 she states the
following.
 
 this case calls out for a
sentence
that
reflects in particular the principle of general deterrence. all drivers
of motor vehicles need to understand the consequences of their driving
behaviour on other persons using the roadway. they must understand that
using roadways in a manner that is inconsiderate and indeed, fool hardy,
careless
and with out regard for others is
unacceptable.
street racing
behaviour cannot be tolerated on our roads.
 the case law where non –
custodial dispositions have resulted are distinguishable from the matter at
hand in particular in the most significant aspect, the racing behaviour. 
this is particularly aggravating. given the aggravating circumstances of
this case, and the need for general and specific deterrence, denunciation and
despite some mitigating factors regarding mr. williams-cordeiro himself, i have
determined that a non-custodial
sentence
even
with a significant period of probation, is not appropriate.
 given the facts of the
matter, and the public recognition of the need to denounce this type of driving
behaviour, i view is that an appropriate
sentence
is
one of 9 months in custody. probation for 18 months thereafter with the
statutory terms: that you attend court when and as required, that you not
commit the same or similar offence that can result in imprisonment and that you
notify the court of any change in your address. during the period of
probation you are not to operate a motor vehicle. your driver’s licence will be
suspended for a period of four years beginning today.
specific deterrence

specific
deterrence seeks to prevent an individual offender from reoffending. sentences
aimed at achieving this objective are intended to impress upon the offender the
personal consequences of their actions, thereby dissuading future misconduct.
in crafting such sentences, courts evaluate the offender’s risk of reoffending
by considering factors such as personal background, expressions of remorse, and
prospects for rehabilitation.

in
the present case, specific deterrence emerges as a central sentencing
consideration. ms. sprayson’s driving record is particularly troubling for
someone of her age. although defence counsel has attempted to minimize the
seriousness of her record by noting that many of the speeding infractions
involved speeds less than 20 kilometres over the limit, the court does not
accept this argument.

the
court is particularly concerned by ms. sprayson’s convictions for speeding,
including two that occurred after the incident in question. additionally, two
licence suspensions following the offence raise further alarm. of even greater
concern are the two prior convictions for careless driving, particularly one
which occurred just days before the fatal and life-altering collision at issue.
these facts reflect a pattern of behaviour that cannot be overlooked.

ms. sprayson’s continued denial and distortion of key facts
surrounding this incident further underscores the necessity of specific
deterrence. notably, misleading information was presented to both the court and
the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report (psr). it was
repeatedly suggested that ms. sprayson had been denied the opportunity to
grieve her best friend or to say goodbye—an assertion made during trial, in the
psr interview, and during defence submissions.

however,
it was not until the crown’s reply to the defence submissions that the court
learned the wambolt family had, in fact, understood the closeness of the
relationship between riley and madison. arrangements had been made for ms.
sprayson to attend the funeral home in private before the public visitation,
with the funeral director's involvement corroborating these efforts. this
misrepresentation constitutes yet another example of the distortion of facts in
this case, thereby reinforcing the imperative for specific deterrence.
general deterrence

general deterrence seeks to discourage the public from engaging in
similar conduct by signaling that such behaviour will be met with meaningful
sanctions. it is particularly important in cases where the offence threatens
public safety, public order, or public confidence in the legal system.
sentences focused on general deterrence tend to emphasize the gravity of the
offence and the necessity of conveying a strong societal message of
condemnation.

both deterrence principles must be balanced with other sentencing
objectives, including denunciation, rehabilitation, and the promotion of a
sense of responsibility in offenders. ultimately, the sentence imposed must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
the offender.

deterrence
is the paramount factor in sentencing under public welfare statutes. (
r. v. cotton felts ltd.
(1982),
1982 canlii 3695 (on ca), 2
c.c.c. (3d) 287 (ont. c.a.). punishment must be felt by the defendant
(specific deterrence) while also serving as a warning to others who might be
contemplating similar misconduct (general deterrence). moreover, a just
sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and responsibility
of offender. in crafting an appropriate sentence, the court must consider the
circumstances of the offence and of the offender to assess which factors tend
to justify a more lenient sentence and which tend to elevate its severity.

in addressing the issue of sentencing, it is necessary to
acknowledge the fundamental distinction between regulatory and criminal
offences. regulatory offences, such as those in the
highway traffic act
are
characterized as public welfare offences, do not carry the same degree of moral
blameworthiness traditionally associated with criminal conduct.

they are enacted to ensure adherence to regulatory schemes intended
to safeguard public health, safety, and welfare. the principal objectives of
sentencing in the regulatory context are the promotion of compliance, the
deterrence of future infractions, and the protection of the public interest.
sentences typically involve the imposition of monetary fines, periods of
probation, remedial measures, and, in rare and exceptional circumstances,
custodial dispositions. imprisonment is reserved for the most serious
regulatory breaches, particularly where aggravating factors or repeated
non-compliance are present.

i turn to
r. v. henry
para
22-27
to illustrate the forementioned
points.
22 deterrence as it relates to offences under the
highway
traffic act
reflects the need to both specifically and generally
discourage persons from driving behaviors that negatively impact the safety of
those using the roadways, as either pedestrians, passengers or drivers. the
highway traffic act exists to ensure that the roadways can be used safely by
all.
23 the
highway
traffic act
was amended in 2018 to include
s. 130(3)
careless causing death and/or
bodily harm and associated sentencing provisions of
s. 130(4). 
these were intended to send a message that driving carelessly could result in
significant penalties should the consequences cause death or bodily harm.
24 in the first
session of legislative debate in hansard (legislative assembly of ontario-
hansard- june 9, 2016, 41
st
parliament, 1
st
session)
with respect to bill 213- an act to amend the highway traffic act:
ultimately, the goal is to have
penalties in place that discourage careless driving and encourage good choice
behind the wheel. but we will also use this opportunity to help promote public
awareness of the threat posed by motor vehicles in the hands of the wrong
person.
with bill 213, both our officers
and courts will have the opportunity to send that very clear signal that
driving with due care and attention matters.
25 the principle of
proportionality means that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity
of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. the 2018
amendments of the
highway traffic act
to include escalated penalties
for driving without due care and attention reflect the seriousness and often
catastrophic consequences of such driving conduct.
26 it is important to
remind myself that it is the conduct of driving without due care and
attention that is the focus of sentencing.
in
r. v. grosse,
2017
oncj
228:
however, it is not the
consequences that is the focus of the sentence rather, it is the driving
conduct itself, lack of due care and attention, along with other mitigating and
aggravating factors being taken into consideration (at para 7).
27 finally, the
principle of restraint guides all sentencing in both
criminal code
and
regulatory statutes. i am alive to the need for restraint and that the sentence
imposed is not to be more than is required in the particular circumstances
having regard to the relevant factors.

the
court recognizes that sentencing in regulatory matters involving a fatality can
be difficult for the public to fully understand. when a life is lost—permanently
and irrevocably—the grief experienced by loved ones is immeasurable. in such
cases, the public rightly expects accountability commensurate with the gravity
of the harm. yet, this court is bound to reach its decision not on emotion, but
through a principled and lawful application of sentencing principles.

the
court offers its deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the family and loved
ones of the deceased, as well as to all those whose lives have been permanently
altered by this tragic event. the pain of losing a loved one under such sudden
and preventable circumstances is immeasurable. your grief is compounded by the
reality that no sentence, no matter how severe, can ever restore what has been
taken or rebuild the future that will never come to pass.

this
process has undoubtedly been long and emotionally exhausting. the court
acknowledges the courage it has taken for you to endure each stage of these
proceedings—to sit through evidence, to relive trauma, and to wait for justice
under the weight of overwhelming loss. your dignity, resilience, and unwavering
presence in court are a testament to the profound love you had for the person
you lost and to your strength as a community of mourners.

the
court is fully aware that no judicial outcome can truly bring closure to such a
devastating loss. the sentencing delivered today does not, and cannot,
compensate for a life cut short, nor can it erase the void that remains. but it
is the court’s sincere hope that the resolution of this matter offers at least
a measure of recognition, accountability, and the beginnings of peace as you
continue the long and difficult journey of grief and healing.

to
each of you affected by this tragedy: your loss is deeply felt, and your voices
have been heard. the court honours the memory of the life lost and stands in
solemn respect for your suffering.

in
arriving at an appropriate sentence, the court has considered the magnitude of
harm caused, the clear negligence and disregard for legal obligations
displayed, the context in which the offence occurred, the offender’s recent and
troubling driving history, the enduring and devastating impact on the victim’s
family, and the extent to which the offender has taken responsibility or
expressed genuine remorse.

after
careful review of the statutory provisions, the applicable jurisprudence, the
aggravating and mitigating factors, and the submissions of both crown and
defence counsel, the court finds that the sentence imposed must reflect the
seriousness of this offence, the permanent loss suffered, the offender’s moral
culpability, and the public interest in both specific and general deterrence.
sentence

the sentencing
submissions presented to the court have spanned a wide range, reflecting
divergent views on culpability and consequence. having fully considered all
relevant factors, the court determines that the following sentence is just and
necessary.

please stand. the
prosecution has proposed a sentence of 18 months' incarceration, while defence
has requested a fine of $5,000 or, alternatively, a short custodial sentence of
10–15 days. given your recent driving suspensions due to unpaid fines and your
demonstrated irresponsibility leading to a fatal outcome, this court finds that
a fine is entirely inappropriate. fines are a sanction of leniency, and this is
not a case that warrants leniency. accordingly, you are sentenced to
12 months of custody.
this reflexes the median sentence under the amended legislation.

on the matter of
driving prohibition: while the defence has requested no suspension and the
crown has sought a 5-year prohibition, the court must prioritize
public safety.
your history and conduct demonstrate a disregard for legal and civic
obligations. accordingly, your
driver’s licence shall be suspended for a period of 4 years.

both parties
have agreed to a probationary term of 24 months following your release. you are
hereby placed on probation for a period of two years. the following statutory
conditions will apply:
(a) you shall not commit the
same or any similar offence, nor any offence under a statute of canada,
ontario, or any other province punishable by imprisonment;
(b) you shall appear before the
court when required;
(c) you shall notify the court
promptly of any change to your address.

the crown has
sought an order requiring you to perform 250 hours of community service. the
defence has made no submissions on this point. pursuant to section 72 (3) (b)
of the
provincial offences act,
community service may only be imposed with the defendant’s consent, which has
not been provided. the court is therefore not able to make such an order at
this time.

there has been
no expressed consent given in this matter and the court is not able to request
such consent nor to i think it necessary or appropriate to request it at this
point in proceedings. this is an issue that should have been addresses during
submissions for sentence. accordingly, no community service condition shall be
imposed.

i will however,
pursuant to section 72 (3) (d) ordered you to report to a probation officer and
to remain under that officer’s supervision throughout the duration of your
probation order, or until otherwise directed by your supervising officer.

ms. sprayson, i
have previously addressed the victims and their families. currently i wish to
recognize that today marks a significant and painful moment in your life as
well. while the consequences of your actions have been devastating, the court
does not lose sight of the fact that rehabilitation and accountability are not
mutually exclusive. the sentence imposed is not only a reflection of the harm
caused, but also an opportunity an obligation for you to reflect, to take
responsibility, and to make amends in the ways that remain possible.

it is hoped that
the time ahead, both in custody and under supervision, will not be wasted, but
used purposefully: to understand the full weight of what has occurred, to
confront your role in it with honesty, and to begin rebuilding a future
grounded in greater care for others, for the law, and for the responsibilities
we all carry when we act in society.

there is always
the capacity for change for growth, for contrition, and for redemption. but
that path is yours to walk, and it begins with acknowledgment and continues
through sustained effort. the court encourages you to take this sentence not
just as a punishment, but as a solemn chance to commit to a future defined not
by this tragedy, but by your actions moving forward to honour the life that was
lost and to rebuild trust in those around you.

you are being
held accountable today. what you do with this accountability, and how you carry
its weight, will define the legacy of this chapter.
