j.:

following a trial, i found b.s.
guilty of three offences: count 1, having sexual intercourse with a female who
was not his wife without her consent, contrary to
s. 143
(a) of the
criminal
code; count 2, having sexual intercourse with a female who was not his wife
and was under the age of
fourteen,
contrary to
s. 146(1)
of the
criminal code, and count 3, having
intercourse with a person who was related to him by blood, namely his sister,
contrary to
s. 150(1)
of the
criminal code. all three offences involve
the rape of c.b. and were committed sometime between august 16, 1971 and august
17, 1973, when b.s. was between 15 and 17 years old.

had these charges been before the
courts in 1973, b.s. would have been considered a “child”
1
for any “delinquencies”
2
he
committed while under the age of 16. as such, he would have been tried and
sentenced pursuant to the
juvenile delinquents act (jda)
that was then
in effect.
for offences committed after he turned 16, he would have been
tried and sentenced as an adult under the
criminal code. at that time,
adults found guilty on count 1 and 2 were liable to a maximum sentence of life
in prison and to 14 years in prison on count 3.

the
jda
was repealed in
1984. the current legislation governing youth court proceedings is the
youth
criminal justice act. under the
ycja, the court has jurisdiction
over offences committed by a young person when they are between the ages of 12
and 17 years old, no matter how old they are at time of trial. section 161 of
the
ycja
contains a transitional provision, making the applicable
disposition or sentences available under the
ycja
applicable to a person
found guilty of committing a “delinquency” when they were a child under the
jda.

b.s. seeks a ruling that based on
the guarantee contained in section 11(i) of the
charter of rights and
freedoms, the maximum sentence that can be imposed on him is a period of
probation, as that is the harshest sentencing option available under s. 20(1)
of the
jda. while section 20(1)(i) of that act allows for committal to
an industrial school, that option is no longer available as there are no industrial
schools in canada.

on the other hand, if b.s. is to
be sentenced under the
ycja, section 42(2)(n) of that legislation states
permits a young person who is found guilty of an offence for which the maximum
punishment is imprisonment for life, to be sentenced to a period of custody and
supervision of up to 3 years, 2 years of which would be served in custody,
followed by 1 year in the community under supervision. indeed this is precisely
the sentence the crown is seeking on count 1. moreover, since b.s. is now an
adult over the age of 20, section 89(1) of the
ycja
requires him to
serve the custodial portion of the sentence in a provincial correctional
facility for adults.

b.s. argues that since the maximum
available sentence available under the
jda
is lesser than the sentence
options currently available under the
ycja, he is entitled to the
protection afforded under
s. 11(i)
of the
charter, and he should be
sentenced according to the provisions of the
jda.

the crown submits that by applying
the proper definition of the term “punishment”, as that term has recently been
interpreted by the supreme court of canada, the
ycja
provides the lesser
punishment. crown counsel argues that the
jda
provided for indefinite
detention
of juvenile delinquents to
industrial schools, which were in reality commitment to a custodial institution
that also featured rehabilitative programming. had b.s. been sentenced under
that act, he could have faced a significant restriction on his liberty of
indefinite temporal duration, up to the age of 21.
analysis:

section 11(i)
of the
charter
states:
any person charged with an
offence has the right …
(i)
if found guilty of the offence and
if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of
commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.

in
r. v. k.r.j.,
2016 scc 31 (canlii),
 1
s.c.r. 906, the supreme court of canada expanded the concept of “punishment” by
adding a consideration of the impact of a sanction on a person’s liberty. it
held that that a measure or sanction constitutes “punishment” under s. 11(i)
when it is (1) a consequence of a conviction that forms part of the arsenal of
sanctions; and (2) it is imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles
of sentencing, or (3) has a significant impact on an offender’s liberty or
security interests (para. 41). in order to satisfy this third requirement, a
consequence of conviction must significantly constrain a person's ability to
engage in otherwise lawful conduct or impose significant burdens not imposed on
other members of the public (para. 42).

in
r. v. poulin,
2019 scc
47, the supreme court of canada provided an analytical framework withing which
to interpret the right under s. 11(i). it held that s. 11(i) confers a binary
right requiring a comparison between “punishments” in force at the time of the
offence and the ones in force at time of sentencing. once that has been
identified, the question then becomes which of these measures or sanctions
constitute “punishment” in the sense contemplated by s. 11(i). in answering
this question, the court must consider all aspects of the sentences available,
including any ancillary orders. once the various “punishments” for the offence
have been identified, they must be compared and contrasted to determine which
one reflects the “lesser” punishment.

as pointed out by the court
in
poulin,
at para
42, often the comparison is obvious in that one sentence allows for a
shorter period of incarceration over the other. at other times, the
determination of the lesser punishment requires a more nuanced approach with a
view to all of the possible consequences facing an offender. the analysis may
be further complicated if the lesser punishment contains any statutory
prerequisite or if there are qualitative differences between the two regimes
(paras 44-48).

the crown agrees that placing b.s.
on probation in accordance with s. 20(1)(d) of the
jda
is not akin to
committal to custody. indeed, the jurisprudence establishes that this section
did not confer upon the sentencing judge the power to order a juvenile to be
placed in a group home: see
peel et al. v. viking houses,
1977 canlii
1411 (on sc)
aff’d
1977 canlii 47 (on ca)
aff’d
1979 canlii 48 (scc);
regional
municipality of peel v. mckenzie et al.,
1980 canlii 64
(onca)
).

the issue before me is whether
committal to an industrial or training schools, as they were also known,
pursuant to s. 20(1)(i) of the
jda
is tantamount to committal in custody
for an indefinite term, up to the age of 21
3, and is
therefore a “punishment” as contemplated under
s. 11(i)
of the
charter.
the crown argues that given the possible length of time that a child could be
committed to an industrial school, and the harsh conditions in those
institutions, such a sentence was in fact a “punishment” of much longer
duration than that available under the
ycja.

in
r. v. s.b.
(1983)
1983 canlii 371 (bc ca),
3
c.c.c. (3d) 390, the bcca considered whether a juvenile committed to an
industrial school for potentially 5 years or more is
subject to “punishment” by way of imprisonment such that they have the right to
a trial by jury as guaranteed by
s. 11(f)
of the
charter. in concluding
that committal to an industrial school is not tantamount to “punishment” by way
of imprisonment, the court looked to the purpose of the act, which was not to
punish, but to treat and rehabilitate children. in reference to sections 3(2)
and 38 of the
jda, the court held:
the above
provisions, when read in the context of the act, clearly indicate that a
juvenile is not to be treated as a criminal offender deserving of punishment
but as "a misdirected or misguided child in need of aid, encouragement,
help and assistance". the purpose of the act is not to punish but to
afford treatment. such treatment may require that a juvenile be confined. it
does not follow that confinement constitutes punishment. it is the purpose of
the confinement that determines whether or not such confinement can be
construed as punishment.

our court of appeal in
r. v.
d.t.
 o.j. no. 2592
agreed with and adopted the reasoning in
r. v.
s.b,
supra. other trial level courts have come to a similar
conclusion: see
r. v. r.s.,
2005 yktc 72;
r. v. a.b.m.,

b.c.j. no. 2642;
r. v. l.c.,
 y.j. no. 42;
r. v. m.r.h.
 a.j. no. 280.

in
r v. s.s.,
1990 canlii 65 (scc),
 2
s.c.r. 254,
the supreme court of canada recognized that the underlying
premise of the
jda
was the welfare of the child. the court cited
excerpts from
justice and the young offender in canada
(1988), written
by joe hundson, joseph
p. hornick, and barbara burrows, at pages 4-5:
the juvenile
court was to serve, in whatever manner deemed necessary, the best interests of
the children who came before it. the court was to act as a kind of clinic,
concerned with assessing and fulfilling the needs of its clients, as opposed to
a criminal court concerned with due process and the protection of society.
delinquency was viewed as a product of the social environment and susceptible
to treatment. the court's role under the
jda
was to act on behalf of
parents when the best interests of children were not being met. thus the court
took on the role of a "... stern but understanding parent."
the protective
ideology was integral to the
jda. indeed, the
jda
is widely
described as paternalistic. the parens patriae doctrine of the
jda
"...
emphasized treatment and minimized accountability (on the part of the young
person)". children were to be saved, not punished for their misdeeds. the
parens patriae doctrine drew no distinction between criminal and noncriminal
youth conduct, which supported the view that juvenile court proceedings were
civil rather than criminal in nature. there was seen to be no need to
differentiate between delinquent and neglected children. rather, they were
perceived by one of the original drafters of the
jda
to be of the
"same class"; the principal concern was to be on treatment (i.e.
helping the child), with "minimal attention paid to accountability, or the
justification for intervention".

the crown submits that the cases relied on by b.s. are
not applicable as they predate
krj
and
poulin. these cases do not
consider the expanded definition of “punishment”, which places a greater
emphasis on the real impact of the sentence on the offender’s liberty. in its
response, the crown cited academic articles and a 1965
report to the
department of justice committee on juvenile delinquency. this material
makes it clear that industrial schools were reformatory custodial institutions
that were often lacking in adequate facilities and staff, in distant locations.
the average length of stay in such institutions was two years.

in assessing the nature of a
sentence imposed under s. 20(1)(i) of the
jda, i found
the case of
r
v. r.s.,
 y.j. no. 95 (territorial court)
to be useful. in that case,
the court compared industrial
schools to
the lower level security facilities available under s. 85 of the
ycja,
which are similar to “open custody” and “secure custody” facilities under the
young
offender’s act.
citing a passage from justice corey in
r. v. j.j.m,
1993 canlii 91 (scc),

2 s.c.r. 421, justice ruddy observed that while open custody facilities
restrict the liberty of the young offender, those places are not simply jails
for young people. rather they are facilities dedicated to the long term welfare
and reformation of the young offender.

in applying these principles to the
case before me, i find that
s. 11(i)
of the
charter
requires me to
sentence b.s. as a juvenile according to the provisions of the
jda.
i am
satisfied and find as a fact, that the
jda
provides for the “lesser
punishment”. in coming to this conclusion, i have considered and adopted
the
reasoning in
r. v. s.b., supra, and
r. v. d.t., supra.
clearly
the objective and purpose of the
jda
was not to punish children but to
treat them. the act simply did not allow for custodial sentences. the issue
before the courts in those cases was whether a sentence under the
jda
was
a “punishment” for the purpose of the availability of a jury trial guaranteed
by
s. 11(f)
of the
charter. nonetheless, the court
in
poulin
at
para.
40
held that the term “punishment” is to be defined consistently across
sections 11
and
12
of the
charter.

on the other hand, one of the
goals and objectives of the
ycja
is to hold young persons accountable
through the imposition of appropriate consequences, including a period of
imprisonment in either a youth
or adult
facility, depending on the seriousness of the offence and the young person’s
age at time of sentence.

section s. 39(1)(a) of the
ycja
states that a youth court shall not commit a young person to
custody unless the young person has committed a
violent offence. b.s. has been found guilty of rape, which is a violent
offence. on that offence, s. 42(2)(n) would allow me to sentence b.s. to a
custody and supervision order of up to 3 years, 2 years of which would be
served in custody. indeed this is the sentence advocated by the crown. since
b.s. is now an adult over the age of 20, section 89(1) of the
ycja
requires
that he serve the custodial portion of the sentence in a provincial
correctional facility for adults. thus the comparison is between committal to
an industrial school versus committal to an adult facility.

this is one of those cases
referred to
in
r. v. poulin,
supra, that requires a more nuanced
comparison between the two “punishments” beyond just comparing the length of
sentences available. i accept that depending on their age, a juvenile might be
subject to committal to an industrial school for longer than the 2 years of
custody permitted under s. 42(2)(n) of the
ycja. nonetheless, a
qualitative comparison between those two options leads me to the inescapable
conclusion that an adult facility constitutes a far greater restriction on a
person’s liberty than that which they would face if they were committed to an
industrial school. thus, even on an expanded definition of punishment, i find
that committal to an industrial school is the lesser punishment.

there is one last issue in this
matter that i must address. as previously
stated, i found that b.s. committed the offences when he was between 15 and 17
years old. cb testified, and i accepted, that there were multiple incidents of
rape. unfortunately the evidence before me does not permit me to conclusively
determine when precisely each of the offences where committed. if b.s.
committed some or all of the rapes when he was 16 or older, he would have been
tried and sentenced as an adult and subject to be sentenced to a maximum of
life in prison under the
criminal code. in that scenario, clearly the
sentence allowed under s. 42(2)(n) of the
ycja
would be the “lesser
sentence”.

the crown has not argued that i should find b.s. to
have committed all or some of the offences after he turned 16. there is
insufficient evidence to support that conclusion. in the absence of such
evidence, b.s. is entitled to be sentenced as a child pursuant to the
jda.
since we no longer have training or industrial schools, the maximum allowable
sentence is a period of probation pursuant to s. 20(1)(d) of the
jda.
