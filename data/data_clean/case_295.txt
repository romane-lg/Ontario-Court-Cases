direction re: defence final

kenkel j.:

mr. chand is charged with aggravated assault
and related offences. the trial evidence is complete, and the defence and crown
have provided their final submissions in writing. unfortunately, there are
serious problems with the defence submissions.

one of the cases cited appears to be
fictitious. the court was unable to find any case at that citation. there was no
case by that name with that content at any other citation.

several case citations led to unrelated civil cases. some
case names were potentially related to self-defence, but the citations were for
completely different cases. other citations led to the case named, but the case
did not provide authority for the point cited. the errors are
numerous and substantial.

there will be a discussion at the conclusion of the trial about how
the defence submissions were prepared, but at this time the court's focus is on
concluding the trial in a way that is fair to both parties.

i appreciate that this case likely turns on findings of fact and
credibility, not the legal points in the defence submissions. i also appreciate
that the general test for self-defence does not appear to be at issue. the
disagreement between the parties is primarily a factual dispute not a legal
one. however, mr. chand is entitled to the benefit of full submissions on all
aspects of the case. i find it necessary to order that mr. ross personally
prepare a new set of defence submissions within the following guidelines:
•
the paragraphs must be numbered;
•
the pages must be numbered;
•
case citations must include a pinpoint cite to the paragraph that
illustrates the point being made;
•
case citations must be checked and hyperlinked to canlii or other
site to ensure accuracy;
•
generative ai or commercial legal software that uses genai must
not be used for legal research for these submissions.

mr. ross has done a good job presenting the
defence in this case. i’m confident that he will be able to prepare proper
submissions within these guidelines.
