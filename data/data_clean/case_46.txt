introduction

mr. lam was found guilty after trial of the following
offences:
1.
possession of firearm knowing its possession is unauthorized, contrary
to
s. 92(1)
of the
criminal code;
2.
unauthorized possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle, contrary to
s.
94(1)
of the
criminal code;
3.
possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, contrary to
s. 95(1)
of the
criminal code;
4.
possession of a prohibited device, contrary to
s. 92(2)
of the
criminal
code;
5.
possessing a firearm knowing its serial number has been defaced,
contrary to
s. 108(1)
(b) of the
criminal code;
6.
possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s.
5(2) of the controlled drugs and substances act;
7.
possession of p-fluorofentanyl for the purpose of trafficking, contrary
to s. 5(2) of the controlled drugs and substances act; and
8.
possession of a mixture of fentanyl and p-fluorofentanyl for the purpose
of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2) of the controlled drugs and substances act.

the sole issue at mr. lam’s trial was whether
the evidence discovered in the vehicle he was driving was admissible. for
reasons previously given, i concluded that the police breached mr. lam’s rights
under sections 10(a) and 10(b) of the charter but admitted the evidence under
section 24(2). as a result, mr. lam was convicted on all charges.

the crown seeks a total sentence of seven years
imprisonment. the crown also requests a dna order, and a s. 109 weapons
prohibition.

the defence submits that the appropriate disposition
is a conditional sentence of two years less one day followed by three years
probation. the defence does not oppose the ancillary orders sought by the
crown.
the facts
relating to the offences

mr. lam was stopped by police while driving
alone on highway 401 in bowmanville. during the stop, officers discovered and
seized the following items in his possession:
•
26.7 grams of fentanyl
•
55.3 grams of p-fluorofentanyl
•
167.5 grams of cocaine
•
$585 in cash
•
a cutting agent (caffeine)
•
a loaded, prohibited firearm that was defaced and equipped with a
selector switch.

the expert report filed on consent estimates that the total value
of the seized cocaine ranged from $13,360 to $19,440 if sold by the gram, and
from $6,840 to $10,260 if sold by the ounce. the report further indicates that
the combined value of the fentanyl and p-fluorofentanyl was between $16,400 and
$32,800.
the circumstances of the offender

i have considered the pre-sentence report,
numerous letters of support, and counsel’s submissions. mr. lam also submitted
and read a personal letter to the court.

mr. lam was 20 years old at the time of the
offences. he is of mixed heritage. his father was born in trinidad and is of
chinese and portuguese descent. his mother was born in canada and is of
trinidadian heritage.

mr. lam grew up in ajax, and in 2022 his family moved
into a four-bedroom home in oshawa.

he graduated from high school in 2021. in grade
10, he was assaulted at school, an incident he experienced as traumatic. the
assault left him with a scar and reportedly left him with significant trust
issues. he also reported being bullied during his time in school. he advised
the pre-sentence report author that his teachers recognized his intelligence
and encouraged him.

mr. lam told the pre-sentence report author that
he felt excluded at school because of race. he also described experiencing
stigma in the community, including being followed in stores. he also claimed to
have had negative interactions with male police officers, which he described as
“terrible,” though he did not elaborate.

mr. lam’s family operates a landscaping
business. his relationship with his mother has always been positive, while his
relationship with his father was strained during his upbringing. mr. lam’s
father was often busy with work, and mr. lam mainly viewed him as a
disciplinarian. their relationship has improved significantly over the past
year. in his letter, mr. lam’s father acknowledged his parental shortcomings.
he also described having recently bonded with his son and emphasized mr. lam’s
contributions to the family business.

with respect to employment, mr. lam has worked
in the family business and briefly at a warehouse and flea market. his stated
goal is to continue working with his father.

mr. lam has been in a relationship since 2023
with azareel recile. she describes him as loving, respectful, and caring. in
her letter, she mentioned his commitment to counselling and the family business
and credits him with supporting her own spiritual journey.

mr. lam reported to the psr author that many of
his former schoolmates, including former friends, are now incarcerated. he
currently lives with one close friend and has reconnected with his faith and
church community.

the letters of support submitted describe mr.
lam’s rehabilitative efforts while on bail, including substance abuse counselling,
psychotherapy, and his active involvement in the family business. they portray
him as having matured, expressed genuine remorse, and demonstrated a strong
work ethic, compassion, and respect for others. they also highlight his
spiritual growth since his arrest and his longstanding involvement in his
church community.

when speaking with the psr author, mr. lam did
not report any issues with alcohol. he indicated that he previously used
marijuana regularly, which caused paranoia, but said he has since stopped.

since july 2025, mr. lam has been enrolled in
the youth substance awareness program. his counsellor describes him as engaged,
respectful, and understanding of accountability.

between june 2023 and august 2025, mr. lam
completed 30 psychotherapy sessions. according to his therapist, he has been
consistently engaged in treatment and has demonstrated progress and
accountability. the therapy focused on addressing personal risk factors and
promoting behavioural responsibility. it included dialectical behaviour therapy
(dbt), which emphasizes developing skills in emotional regulation, distress
tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness.

mr. lam explained to the psr author that he
possessed a firearm out of fear, claiming that he had previously been stabbed
and shot at. he provided few details regarding these events and indicated he
never sought medical attention. he also indicated that “carrying the firearm
gave him a false sense of security amid associations with individuals involved
in criminal activity.”

mr. lam’s mother indicated to the psr author
that she worried about her son’s safety, but only knew what he had told her.
she understood that he had been jumped at the oshawa mall before. mr. lam’s
father stated, “i worried about his personal safety because of the decisions he
would make and the type of people he was around.” ms. recile stated: “of course
when he was meeting the addicts, some people kill for it. but he was never
around that stuff. it was the people he was meeting to traffic the drugs.”

the psr author notes that mr. lam associates his
involvement in drug trafficking with a desire to feel valued and needed.

mr. lam denied gang affiliation, and there is no
evidence to suggest otherwise.

as part of his allocution, mr. lam read a letter
he had written to the court. in it, he expressed genuine remorse and accepted
full responsibility for his actions. he acknowledged the disappointment his
conduct caused to his loved ones and the community. mr. lam outlined the steps
he has taken to improve himself while on bail and expressed gratitude to those
who provided letters of support. he affirmed his commitment to living a
pro-social life, including pursuing further education and contributing
positively to his family’s business.
general principles

the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to
maintain a just, peaceful, and safe society, as set out in
s. 718
of the
criminal code. the fundamental principle is proportionality, which requires
consideration of both the gravity of the offences and the offender’s degree of
responsibility:
s. 718.1. in determining an appropriate sentence, i must weigh
the mitigating and aggravating factors: s. 718.2(a). i am also required to
blend and prioritize the objectives listed in
s. 718
(a)–(f), while applying the
principles of parity, restraint, and totality: s. 718.2(b)–(e).
the
mitigating factors and collateral circumstances

the following mitigating factors are present in
this case:
i.
mr. lam is youthful. he was only 20 at the time he committed these
offences.
ii.
he has no criminal record.
iii.
he has taken meaningful and positive steps towards his rehabilitation,
including participating in drug counselling, spiritual counselling, and
psychotherapy.
iv.
he demonstrated an ability to be a productive worker and possesses
positive employment goals.
v.
he has repeatedly expressed remorse for his conduct to his loved ones,
his counsellors, and to the court during his allocution.
vi.
he has strong support in the community, including from his family,
members of his church, and his girlfriend.
vii.
he ran a very focused trial, which is deserving of some credit given the
need to preserve court resources:
r. v. cunsolo,
2012 onsc 114
at para
52;
r. v. ngo,
2023 onsc 282, at para.
28.
viii.
i accept that mr. lam’s experience with anti-black racism is connected
in some way to his offences:
r. v. morris,
2021 onca 680. his family’s
economic situation became more difficult when his mother lost her job, but it
appears to have improved in more recent years with the growth of the family’s
landscaping business. he had teachers who encouraged him, but he also
experienced racism and bullying in school. his fear of being shot partly
explains his poor decision-making. i further accept that his perceptions of
limited opportunities and his negative peer associations are linked, at least
in part, to systemic and overt racism.
ix.
mr. lam has been subject to restrictive house arrest bail for 19 months.
while i treat this as a significantly mitigating factor, i remain mindful that
“bail is not jail” and i cannot treat them as equivalent. there is no formula
for determining what credit should be granted for time spent on bail.
mitigation is appropriate because stringent bail conditions can be punitive and
therefore “akin” to custody. see:
r. v. vuong,
2021 onca 697, at para.
65;
r. v. joseph,
2020 onca 733, at paras.
107–114;
r. v. place,
2020 onca 546, at para.
20;
r. v. downes
(2006),
2006 canlii 3957 (on ca), 79 o.r. (3d) 321, at
paras.
33–37.

the defence submitted that the
charter
breaches should
mitigate mr. lam’s sentence. i addressed the nature of the breaches and their
impact on mr. lam in my reasons for judgment. having reviewed the relevant
authorities, i am not satisfied that the breaches in this case warrant
mitigation. in my view, the
charter
violations did not affect the
circumstances of the offence or the offender in a way that is relevant to
determining a fit sentence:
r. v. nasogaluak,
2010 scc 6, at para.
48;
r.
v. claros,
2019 onca 626, at paras.
70–75.

incarceration would disrupt mr. lam’s employment
and education and separate him from his family and community supports. these
are relevant considerations; however, i remain mindful that the sentence must
be proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the offender’s degree of
responsibility:
r. v. l.c.,
2022 onca 863, at para.
24.
the gravity of the offences and the
aggravating factors

before mentioning the specific aggravating
features of this case, i will address the general gravity of the offences mr.
lam has been convicted of.

cocaine is a highly addictive and dangerous drug:
r. v. desilva,
2022 onca 879, at para.
104;
r. v. pestill,
2025 onsc 2478, at para.
45.

the threat posed by fentanyl is even greater than that of other
illicit drugs. it is very addictive and exposes users to risks of brain and
organ damage, as well as death. the likelihood of a fatal overdose is extremely
high. a lethal dose can be less than two milligrams. fentanyl has been
described as “public enemy number one”, and trafficking in fentanyl has been
described as a national crisis:
r. v. parranto,
2021 scc 46, at paras.
93 – 96, per moldaver j.;
r. v. campbell,
2024 scc 42, at para.
142.

loaded, illegal handguns are inherently dangerous. they are used
to intimidate, seriously injure, or kill:
r. v. nur,
2015 scc 15, at
para.
7;
r. v. omar,
2018 onca 975, at para.
103, per brown j.a.,
dissenting, rev’d (substantially for the reasons of brown j.a);
r. v.
beharry,
2022 onsc 4370
at para.
19. their possession in public is “antithetical
to the canadian concept of a free and ordered society”:
r. v. morris,
2021 onca 680
at para.
68.

“the courts have repeatedly emphasized that the toxic combination
of drugs and guns poses a pernicious and persisting threat to public safety and
the welfare of the community. the social ills, including associated criminal
conduct, fuelled by this combination is now well
recognized”:
r. v. wong,
2012 onca 767, at para.
11. see also:
r. v.
omoragbon,
2020 onca 336, at para.
22.

there are aggravating features relating to the firearm charges.
the firearm’s serial number was defaced, it was equipped with a selector
switch, and it was recovered in a public setting inside a motor vehicle:
r. v. zaban,
2024 onsc 2704, at para.
41
(f);
r. v. gorgievski,
2024 onsc 5899, 25;
r. v. kurzyna,
2025
onca 725, at para.
8;
r. v. harutyunyan,
2012 onsc 58, at para.
16;
aff’d
2012 onca 637. while mr. lam was convicted of separate offences for the
defaced gun, possessing the selector switch, and having the firearm in the
vehicle, i will impose concurrent sentences for these offences. it is therefore
appropriate to consider these features as aggravating factors:
r. v. mccue,
2012 onca 773, at paras.
21 – 22;
r. v. fortune,
2024 onca 269, at para.
33;
r. v. charley,
2025 onsc 2490, at para.
45.

with respect to the drug charges, the
aggravating factors include the nature of the drugs involved, the quantity of
drugs seized and their significant value. these offences were clearly motivated
by profit.
sentencing
precedents
cases submitted by the
defence

the defence cited several decisions where conditional sentences
were imposed for offences involving firearms, drugs, or both. i have considered
each of the decisions submitted by the defence but will not refer to them all.

in
r. v. williams,
2023 oncj 259, the 25-year-old offender
was sentenced for one count of possessing 14.27 grams of fentanyl for the
purpose of trafficking. he also possessed 3.1 grams of cocaine. the offender
provided financial support to his sister and her two children and acted as a
father figure to them. he also co-parented a child with his former partner and
maintained employment. justice monahan imposed a conditional sentence of two
years less a day. this case is not comparable to mr. lam’s. it involved a guilty
plea, approximately one-fifth the amount of fentanyl, far less cocaine,
significant collateral consequences relating to children, and no firearm.

in
r. v. fabbro,
2021 onca 494, the offender was sentenced
for carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, possession of a prohibited
firearm with readily accessible ammunition, and breaches of court orders. the
offences arose from a standoff with police during which mr. fabbro, in a
suicidal state, pointed an unloaded gun at himself. the sentencing judge imposed
a custodial term of two years less a day. on appeal, the court varied the
sentence to a conditional sentence, emphasizing that the danger posed by the
offender’s conduct was significantly attenuated: the gun was not loaded, mr.
fabbro repeatedly stated he would harm no one but himself, and the officers did
not feel threatened. the case also involved a causal link between the
offender’s mental illness and the offences, guilty pleas, and did not involve
drugs.

in
r. v. stewart,
2024 onsc 281, the 19-year-old first
offender received the equivalent of a conditional sentence of two years less a
day, reduced by credit for pre-sentence custody. he was found in possession of
a loaded firearm with an overcapacity magazine and 9.9 grams of fentanyl. mr.
stewart pleaded guilty. in applying the
morris
factors, the sentencing
judge noted that mr. stewart grew up in poverty, in communities surrounded by
crime, and had a learning disability. overall, the aggravating factors in mr.
lam’s case are more significant, and the mitigating circumstances in mr. stewart’s
case were more pronounced.

in
r. v. hamilton,
2020 onca 163, the offender was found
in possession of a loaded revolver in his vehicle, several bullets in his
pocket, and $337 in cash. subsequent searches of his car and home uncovered
approximately 40 grams of cocaine, over 400 grams of marijuana, two grams of
hashish, drug paraphernalia, brass knuckles, and additional ammunition, both
live and spent. the accused was a youthful first offender who pleaded guilty, expressed
genuine remorse, and had demonstrated an effort to rehabilitate himself. he had
spent 292 days in pre-sentence custody, for which he received 437 days’ credit.
the court of appeal upheld the substance of the trial judge’s global sentence,
which included a 292-day conditional sentence in addition to time served. in
doing so, the court acknowledged that the sentence was below the usual range
given the aggravating features but ultimately deferred to the trial judge’s
discretion.

in
r. v. ramos,
2023 onsc 1094, the offender was a young
first offender who pleaded guilty to possession of a loaded firearm and
possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. she admitted to
possessing approximately 30 grams of powdered cocaine and 33 grams of crack cocaine
for trafficking. the sentencing judge imposed a conditional sentence of two
years less a day, citing several “exceptional circumstances.” the judge noted
that ms. ramos was not the principal in the offences and had minimal control
over the gun and drugs. he also found that she was an addict involved in both
the drug trade and the sex trade because of abuse by her pimp. at the time of
sentencing, she had been on bail for nearly five years and had made significant
rehabilitative progress.
cases submitted by the crown

the crown referred me to the following decisions.

in
r. v. ansah,
2021 onsc 6339, the offender was convicted
of possessing a loaded firearm and 85 grams of fentanyl for the purpose of
trafficking. he was 18 years old at the time of the offences and had no prior
criminal record. mr. ansah had strong family support, and the materials filed
at sentencing demonstrated that the social and economic circumstances in which
he was raised—including racial discrimination—contributed to his instability. his
pre-sentence incarceration included 343 days of full lockdown and 30 days of
partial lockdown, during which prisoners were often confined to their cells,
had limited access to showers and phone calls, and saw programs and visits
cancelled. these harsh jail conditions were treated as a mitigating factor.
after applying the principle of totality, the court imposed an effective
sentence of six years’ imprisonment. i note that mr. ansah’s case involved
significant aggravating features, including pointing a loaded firearm at police
officers and discarding it in a backyard. on the other hand, mr. ansah was two
years younger than mr. lam when he committed his offences, appears to have experienced
greater instability during his upbringing, and endured harsh pre-sentence jail conditions
over a lengthy period. furthermore, unlike mr. lam’s case, mr. ansah’s case did
not involve cocaine, which is an additional hard drug.

in
r. v. griffith,
2022 onsc 6406, the offender was
convicted of possessing 71.25 grams of cocaine and 58 grams of fentanyl for the
purpose of trafficking, as well as possession of over $3,000 in proceeds of
crime. he conceded the crown’s case after his
charter
application was
dismissed. at the time of sentencing, he was 38 years old and had a 13-year-old
son. the sentencing judge found that he had good prospects for rehabilitation.
although he had a criminal record, the judge gave it little weight because it
was very dated and involved less serious offences, referring to mr. griffith as
“essentially a first offender.” the sentence imposed was five years’
imprisonment.

in
r. v. sivashothy,
2024 onsc 6564, the offender was
convicted of possession of 55.78 grams of fentanyl for the purpose of
trafficking. the drugs were concealed in the wheel well of a vehicle rented by
him. at the time of the offence, he was 23 years old, had no prior criminal
record, and had been on non-restrictive bail for four years without any
breaches. he had a supportive family, and his prospects for rehabilitation were
considered positive. the sentencing judge summarized several fentanyl-related
cases at paragraph 18 of his decision and characterized the quantity involved
as falling within the “mid-level trafficking range” (para. 19). the court
imposed a sentence of five years’ imprisonment.
the ranges identified in the case law

the authorities describe a three-to-five-year range for cases
involving loaded firearms in situations where "the use and possession of
the gun is associated with criminal activity, such as drug trafficking":
r.
v. graham,
2018 onsc 6817, at para.
38;
r. v.
beharry,
2022
onsc 4370, at para.
31;
r. v. varela granado,
2025 onsc 1917, at para.
31.

generally, the sentencing range begins at the low end of the
penitentiary range for first-time offenders convicted of possessing a loaded
prohibited firearm in circumstances where there is no other criminal activity:
r.
v. burke-whittaker,
2025 onca 142, at para.
38
(per favreau j.a.), at para.
136 (per hourigan j.a., dissenting);
graham, at para.
37;
beharry,
at para.
31.

the court of appeal has also recognized that there are situations
where conditional sentences are appropriate in cases involving loaded firearms:
r. v. desmund-robinson,
2022 onca 369
at para.13;
morris, at
paras.
124-28, 180-81.

for street-level cocaine trafficking, involving grams up to
approximately an ounce, the range is typically six months to two years less a
day:
r. v. bailey-ricketts,
2024 onsc 1834
at para.
49;
r. v.
woolcock,
 o.j. no. 4927 at para. 15;
r. v. ahmed,
2016 onca
831;
r. v. burke,
2025 onsc 4317
at para.
28. for dealing at the ounce
level, the range generally falls between two and five years:
r. v. graham,
at paras.
47–48;
burke, at para.
29.

the sentencing range for mid-level fentanyl trafficking remains
unsettled. some decisions place the range for mid-level trafficking between
four and seven years, or five and eight years, while other cases suggest a
higher range:
r. v. jackson,
2024 onsc 2402, at paras.
41 & 48;
r.
v. llanos, at paras. 31 – 34;
sivashothy, at paras.
18 & 24;
r.
v. campbell,
2024 onsc 2220, at paras.
38–43;
r. v. owusu,
2024 onsc
671, at para.
37;
r. v. wisdom,
2024 onsc 4047
at paras.
49–50;
r. v.
morias,
2025 onsc 2978, at paras.
48 – 65, and the cases cited therein.

parity is a desirable objective because comparing similar cases
helps calibrate the principle of proportionality. however, because each offence
and offender is unique, sentencing ranges serve as guidelines—not
straightjackets:
r. v. lacasse,
2015 scc 64, at paras.
58 & 60;
r.
v. ruthowsky,
2024 onca 432, at para.
173. that said, “sentencing ranges
cannot be arbitrarily ignored otherwise they become meaningless”:
r. v.
davatgar-jafarpour,
2019 onca 353, at para.
32.
the
appropriate sentences in this case

because mr. lam is a youthful first offender, i “must emphasize
restraint and make space for rehabilitation as a primary and paramount
objective”:
r. v. al-kisadi,
2025 onca 229, at para.
84. while the
gravity of the offences requires that general deterrence and denunciation receive
significant weight, the primary objectives remain individual deterrence and
rehabilitation. i am required to impose the least restrictive sanction capable
of achieving a proportionate sentence:
r. v. brown,
2015 onca 361, at
para.
7;
r. v. randhawa,
2020 onca 668, at para.
30;
r. v. habib,
2024 onca 830, at para.
38.

there are
morris
factors that contributed, to some extent,
to mr. lam’s poor decision-making. while on a strict bail, he has taken
meaningful steps toward rehabilitation, including participating in counselling
and psychotherapy. he has expressed remorse and has strong community support.
he has also demonstrated the ability to become a productive worker.

still, the offences committed are very serious and posed a real
danger to the community. mr. lam’s possessed a loaded firearm, which was
partially defaced, equipped with a selector switch in circumstances associated
with drug trafficking. the quantity and value of the cocaine in mr. lam’s
possession indicate that he was selling at the ounce level. based on the total
quantity and value of the fentanyl and its analogues, i am satisfied that mr.
lam was operating as a mid-level dealer. see:
r. v. st.
rose,
2024 onca 893, at para.
4;
sivashothy,
at para.
19;
llanos, at para. 42;
r. v. campbell,
2022 onca 666,
at para.
101;
r. v. cinelli,
2018 onsc 4983;
jackson, at paras.
1, 20, 27, 45.

i have considered the defence’s request for a conditional
sentence. notwithstanding the mitigating factors mentioned, a significant
penitentiary term is clearly warranted in this case. accordingly, a conditional
sentence is not available:
r. v. johnston,
2023 onca 808, at para.
6.
see also
r. v. richer,
2025 onca 439, at paras.
1, 28, 65, and 73—a case
involving addiction, significantly less fentanyl, no firearm, and notable
collateral consequences relating to a child.

mr. lam is being sentenced for multiple
offences. when deciding between concurrent and consecutive sentences, i must
first determine whether the offences are related, which is a flexible test. i
must then apply the totality principle to ensure the overall sentence is not
excessive:
criminal code, s. 718.2(c);
r. v. millard,
2018 onsc
1299
at para.
30;
r. v. w.q.,
(2006)
2006 canlii 21035 (on ca), 210 c.c.c. (3d) 398, at paras.
11–15
(ont. c.a).

offences arising from the same transaction may
warrant consecutive sentences if they protect different legal interests,
subject to totality:
r. v.
bertrand marchand,
2023 scc 26
at
para.
97;
r. v. fournel,
2014 onca 305
at para.
58.

in this case i have reduced the sentences on
some counts and made other counts concurrent to ensure the overall cumulative
sentence remains proportionate.

having carefully considered all the
circumstances, i have decided that the following sentences are appropriate in
this case:
•
count 7 (possession of p-fluorofentanyl for the purpose of
trafficking): 5 years reduced by 1 year for totality, less 5 days
summers
credit, resulting in a sentence of 4 years less 5 days.
•
count 8 (possession of a mixture of fentanyl and p-fluorofentanyl
for the purpose of trafficking): 5 years reduced by 1 year for totality, less 5
days
summers
credit, resulting in a
concurrent
sentence of 4 years
less 5 days.
•
count 3 (possession of loaded prohibited firearm): 3 ½ years reduced
by 1 year for totality, resulting in a
consecutive
sentence of 2 ½ years.
•
count 2 (unauthorized possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle):
2 years
concurrent.
•
count 4 (possession of a prohibited device) 1 year
concurrent.
•
count 5 (possessing a firearm knowing its serial number has been
defaced): 1 year
concurrent.
•
count 6 (possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking): 2
years
concurrent.

the total sentence is therefore 6 years and 6
months, less 5 days credit pursuant to
summers. i have determined that
this is the lowest overall sentence i can impose having regard to the gravity
of the offences and mr. lam’s degree of responsibility.

count 1 (possession of firearm knowing its possession is
unauthorized) is conditionally stayed pursuant to the principle in
r. v. kienapple,
1974 canlii 14 (scc),
 1 s.c.r. 729.

i will make a dna order in relation to each offence given that
they are all secondary designated offences.

pursuant to s. 109(2)(a) mr. lam is prohibited from possessing
the weapons referred to in that provision for a period of 10 years.

pursuant to s. 109(2)(b), mr. lam is prohibited from possessing
the weapons referred to in that provision for life.

the victim fine surcharge is waived given all the circumstances.
