overview

mr. yaqubi was with acquaintances
in the entertainment district of toronto on january 21, 2023 when he was
stopped by police, detained and searched.
during
this search
a
firearm
was
found
in
his
cross-body
satchel.
as
a
result,
he
stands
charged
with various offences
related to the possession of a prohibited firearm.

at the outset of trial counsel to
mr. yaqubi brought two
charter
applications seeking the following
remedies:
(1)
a
stay
of
proceedings
pursuant
to
s.
24(1)
of
the
charter
based
on
a
breach
of
the
section
7
right
to
make
full
answer
and
defence
due
to
the
loss
of
evidence;
and,
(2)
the exclusion of evidence pursuant
to s 24(2) of the
charter
on the basis of alleged breaches of ss.8, 9
and 10(b) of the
charter
having regard to the circumstances of the applicant’s
detention and the subsequent search of his
satchel.

the
crown
concedes
breaches
of
sections
7
and
10(b).
i
entirely
agree
with
these concessions.
in
addition,
i
find
breaches
of
sections
8
and
9
of
the
charter.
it
is
therefore necessary for me to determine
the full nature and extent of the
charter
breaches in this case and
what, if any,
charter
remedies flow from them.

i have concluded that the
charter
breaches in this case are very serious and that the
evidence
obtained
during
the
detention
and
search
of
the
applicant
must
be
excluded pursuant to section 24(2) of the
charter.
in the alternative, i
would direct a stay of proceedings
given
the
loss
of
evidence
by
police
in
this
case,
having
regard
to
its
impact on the right to make full answer and defence.
background
facts

on
january
21,
2023,
officer
alain
arakaza
was
on
patrol
duty
on
king
street
west near portland street in toronto.
he observed a small group of people
interact with the bouncer
at
ruby
soho,
a
club
on
the
strip,
and
then
walk
away.
the
officer
testified
that shortly
after
the
bouncer
pulled
him to
the
side
to
inform him
that
of
the
group
of
four
(4), only the applicant would not agree
to be searched before entering the club.
officer
arakaza also testified that the bouncer said that he thought the applicant
might be carrying a gun.
this
interaction between the officer and the bouncer was not recorded on body warn
camera (bwc) despite toronto police service (tps) protocols in place requiring
that it be recorded as part of a police investigation.

the group’s interaction with the
doorman was captured on the club’s cctv, though
there
is
no
audio
recording.
a
review
of
the
footage
shows
that
there
does
appear to
be
a
conversation
between
a
doorman
and
a
group
of
people
(including
the
applicant) at the entrance to the club.
the entire group show the bouncer their
identification.
the female enters the
bar.
a male in a blue jay’s jacket
follows behind her but stops when the bouncer briefly interacts with the
applicant. shortly after, the applicant walks away from
the
club
going
east
on
king
st
west
and
the
rest
of
this
group
follow
moments
later.

officer
arakaza
followed
the
group
down
the
street
on
foot.
he
activated
his
bwc but kept the audio
muted.
he testified
that it took
approximately 30
seconds to catch up
to the group.
the bwc was unmuted at
approximately 1:07 a.m. as the officer began speaking to the applicant who the
officer described as very polite and cooperative.
in fact, officer arakaza testified that based on his own
interactions with the applicant he found it “very confusing” to believe that
such a polite and cooperative man might be in possession
of
a
firearm.
the
entirety
of
the
officer’s
stop
on
the
sidewalk,
the
investigative
detention, pat search of the
satchel,
discovery
of the firearm,
and
arrest
are captured
on bwc’s from officers
arakaza and gordon.

officer
arakaza’s
bwc
captured
him
advising
the
applicant
he
was
being
detained
for potential possession of a firearm. he was not cautioned or read rights to
counsel despite the detention.
nonetheless,
officer arakaza did ask the applicant if he had anything on him that he should
not have.
the applicant said “no”.

officer arakaza then immediately
conducted a
pat-down search and felt the
outside
of
the
satchel
worn
by
the
applicant.
when
the
officer
reached
for
the
satchel
the applicant
also
reached
for
it
and
was
told
not
to
touch
it.
officer
arakaza
felt
the
outside of the satchel with his gloved
hands and then told the applicant that he would have to take
a look
inside
the satchel.
the
officer
removed
the satchel
from
the
applicant’s
body while
officer
gordon
held
his
arm.
the
applicant
was
handcuffed
from
the
rear.
he
was still not cautioned or advised of his
right to speak with a lawyer.

officer arakaza looked inside the
satchel and observed a firearm inside, a glock handgun.
at 1:09 officer arakaza advised the applicant he was being
arrested for possession of a firearm.
the
right to counsel was read to the applicant and he immediately
indicated
that
he wished to
speak
with a lawyer.
the
applicant
was
still
not
cautioned.

at 1:10 am officer arakaza removed
the firearm from the satchel and racked it to determine whether it was loaded.
it was not.
despite this fact, officer arakaza told the supervising officer
on scene, sergeant nicholson, that it was chambered. the investigation
then
turned
to
the
three
other
people
who
were
with
the
applicant.
they
too were detained
and a pat down search conducted on them, despite there being was absolutely
no
legal
basis
for
the
officers
to
do
so.
nothing
was
found
and
the
three
friends
were permitted to leave.

at 1:11 officer arakaza muted his
bwc and interacted with the applicant as he was being placed in the cruiser at
1:13 a.m.
officers gordon and brown
conducted a subsequent search incident to arrest of the applicant near the hood
of the scout car. when placing
him
back into the scout
car officer
gordon asked on
bwc if the
applicant had been given his right to
counsel.
officer arakaza confirmed
that the applicant had been his right to counsel and then he cautioned him as
he sat in the back of the cruiser.

at 1:19 a.m. sgt nicholson advised
the officers to transport the applicant to the police station. before doing so,
officer arakaza again turned off his bwc at 1:19.
he testified, in accordance with his notes, that he spoke with
the bouncer at ruby soho at 1:20
a.m.
at
which
time
the
bouncer
refused
to
provide
a
statement.
at
1:28
a.m.
officers
arakaza and vukovic walked the applicant from one scout car to another.
at that time the applicant asked to speak
to a family member and was told he would have a reasonable opportunity to use
the phone.

at 1:36
a.m. officers arakaza and
vukovic
left the
scene with the
applicant in
the scout
car.
during
transport,
the
applicant
was
questioned
about
his
age
and
occupation, and
other questions, despite the fact that he had not yet been cautioned and had
asked to
speak
with
a
lawyer.
no
call
had
been
placed
yet
to
a
lawyer
or
to
duty
counsel
on
his
behalf.

the parties arrived at the station
at 1:44 a.m.
the applicant was
removed from the
cruiser
at
2:11
a.m.
cautioned
by
the
booking
sergeant
at
2:13
a.m.
and
frisk
searched at
2:21
am.
the
applicant
was
lodged
in
a
cell
at
2:30
a.m.
the
first
call
to
duty
counsel
at 2:56 a.m.
sometime between then
and 4:00 a.m. officer arakaza’s notes indicate there
was
a
duty
counsel
call
back.
it
is
not
clear
from
any
officer’s
notes
if
the
applicant
ever spoke to a lawyer or duty counsel.
the
charter
claims
sections
8
and
9
of
the
charter
sections
8 and 9 of the
charter
are properly considered together in the context
of this
application.
section
9:
arbitrary
detention

section 9 of the
charter
provides
that everyone has the right to not be arbitrarily detained.
to determine whether section 9 has been
infringed the analysis proceeds in two stages.
first it
must be
determined
whether there was
a
detention.
second, it
must be
determined
that
the
detention
was
arbitrary.
an
unlawful
detention
is
always
arbitrary and unjustifiably limits the
protections provided by section 9:
r
v. le,
2019 scc 34
at para.
29;
r v. grant,
2009 scc 32, at paras.
54-56.

the police may detain an
individual for investigative purposes where, in all of the circumstances, there
are reasonable grounds
to suspect that
the individual
is
connected to a particular crime, and
their detention is necessary:
r v. mann
2004 scc 52 (canlii),
 3 s.c.r. 59. reasonable
suspicion must be assessed against the totality of the circumstances.
this inquiry
must
consider
the
constellation
of
objectively
discernible
facts
that
are
said
to
give
rise to the officer’s suspicion that an individual is involved in the criminal
activity under investigation.
the
inquiry must be fact-based, flexible and grounded in common sense and
practical
experience.
a
mere
hunch,
or
even
a
sincerely
held
subjective
belief,
is
not sufficient
to
engage
the
detention
power:

section
8:
unreasonable search
and
seizure

a pat-down search incidental to a
valid
investigative detention is only lawful if (1) the officer has reasonable
grounds to believe there is a specific safety concern, (2) the decision to
search is reasonably necessary in light of the totality of the circumstances,
and
(3)
the
search
is
conducted
reasonably.
the
search
“must
be
grounded
in
objectively
discernible
facts
to
prevent
fishing
expeditions
on
the
basis
of
irrelevant
or
discriminatory
factors.”
vague safety concerns
cannot be used to justify these searches; hunches or mere
intuition
are
not
enough.
the
only
other
circumstance
that
justifies
a
search
incident to
an
investigative
detention
is
when
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
eliminate
“an
imminent threat
to the safety of the public or the police.”
this
case

clearly
there
was
a
detention
in
this
case.
officer
arakaza
advised
the
applicant he was detained at 1:07 a.m. and
immediately conducted a
pat down
search.
however, there were
insufficient grounds to detain mr. yaqubi.

officer arakaza testified that his
grounds to detain the applicant were based on: his
observations
of
the
applicant
wearing
a
cross
body
satchel;
his
experience
working
in the entertainment district; and a conversation with a bouncer who
refused to give his name
or
provide
a
statement.
viewing
the
circumstances
objectively,
and
in
their
totality,
officer arakaza’s decision to detain the applicant for possession of a firearm
did not amount
to
reasonable
suspicion.
officer
arakaza
lacked
“reasonable
grounds
to
suspect a clear nexus
between the individual and a recent or still unfolding crime.”:
le
at
para
131.

in seeking
to justify
the
detention,
the
officer
points
primarily to the
information
he obtained from a
bouncer at the club, i.e. that
the applicant
declined
to be searched prior to entering the club
and
walked away instead.
whether or not the officer was provided
with
this
information
during
his
unrecorded
interview
with
the
bouncer
is
the
subject
of
the
charter
section
7/lost
evidence
claim
discussed
below.
for
the
reasons
elaborated
upon below, i can have no real confidence
in the officer’s account of his conversation with the bouncer.
however,
for
the
purposes
of
the
section
8
and
9
charter
analysis
i
will
assume that the officer’s account of what
he was told is true and accurate.

characteristics that apply broadly to innocent people,
or factors that go “both ways”,
such
as
avoiding
eye
contact,
wearing
a
satchel
or
declining
to
be
searched
before entering
a
club,
are
insufficient
to
support
reasonable
suspicion.
as
such,
the
applicant’s decision to
decline being searched before entering a club does not give rise to a
reasonable suspicion that he is carrying a firearm.
there are all kinds of reasons why one
might
not
want
to
submit
to
a
search
before
entering
an
establishment,
many
of
them perfectly
innocent.
that
fact
alone
does
not
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
justifying
an
investigative detention.

in addition to the information from the bouncer, the
officer also relies upon two other factors said to justify his detention of the
applicant: 1. that he was in the entertainment
district
of
toronto
on
a
weekend
night,
and
2.
that
he
was
wearing
a
cross-
body
satchel.
however,
neither
of
these
factors
provide
any
additional
justification
for
the detention and search of the applicant.

while
generalized
concerns
in
the
entertainment
district
may
provide
a
reason
for police presence, they do not justify
an investigative detention, either alone or in conjunction with other factors.
there is no neighbourhood in toronto that
is a
charter
free zone.
citizens
are entitled to precisely the same
charter
protections regardless of
what area the city they
live in or
visit and/or what day of the week it is.
further,
the fact that someone is in that area at that time provides no basis whatsoever
for augmented grounds to believe they are acting unlawfully.
the vast majority of people that visit the
entertainment district of toronto on weekends are doing so lawfully.

as for wearing a cross-body satchel, it is true that
guns are sometimes carried in cross-body satchels.
but that does not mean that all persons – or even most persons –
wearing
cross
body
satchels
are
doing
so
to
conceal
a
firearm.
cross
body
satchels
are very
popular
in
the
population
at
large
and
the
mere
fact
that
one
is
wearing
one
does
not give the police grounds to stop and
frisk.

the
search
of
the
applicant’s
person
and
satchel,
following
an
arbitrary
detention, breaches his section 8
charter
right to be left alone.
without
grounds to detain, there were no grounds to search incidental to that
detention. further, the applicant was polite and
compliant
with
the
officers
and
there
were
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that there was an imminent safety risk to the police or public to
justify stopping the applicant on the street and immediately engaging in a
pat-down search.

the
applicant’s
section
8
and
9
charter
rights
were
violated
in
this
case.
section
10(b)

the section 10(b) right imposes
informational and implementational duties.
it
requires police officers do the following upon arrest or detention:
(1)
inform the
detained
person
immediate
of
their
right
to
counsel;
(2)
facilitate contact with counsel by
offering them the use of a telephone at the first available opportunity, and
(3)
hold
off
questioning
until
the
detainee
has
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to retain and instruct counsel.

the section 10(b) right to counsel
arises immediately upon detention, whether or not the detention is solely for
investigative purposes.
the police
have a duty to inform a detainee of their
right to retain and instruct counsel, and a duty to facilitate that right,
immediately upon detention:
r v. suberu,
2009 scc 33.

determining
whether
a
delay
in
providing
the
right
to
counsel
is
justified
involves
a fact-specific and contextual analysis.
as the
court of
appeal
stated in
r v. rover,
2018 onca
745
at
para.
28,
“the
suspension
of
the
right
to
counsel
is
an
exceptional
step
that should
only
be
undertaken
in
cases
where
urgent
and
dangerous
circumstances
arise
or where there
are concerns for officer or public safety.
this
case

the applicant’s rights under
section 10(b) of the
charter
were infringed in this case.
the
applicant
was
detained
at
1:07
a.m.
he
was
not
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel or
cautioned
until
after
he
had
been
detained,
searched
and
arrested.
instead,
the
officer asked the applicant upon his
initial detention if he had anything he should not have on him.
upon his subsequent arrest the applicant
was informed of his right to counsel (at 1:09 a.m.)
and immediately told the officers that he wanted to speak with a
lawyer.
it is not clear on this
record when if ever a call to counsel was ultimately facilitated.

the
applicant
was
left
waiting
in
the
back
of
the
cruiser
for
22
minutes
with
multiple officers
standing
by,
and
no
concerns
of
safety
noted.
while
section
10(b)
does
not
create
a right to use a specific phone, it does guarantee that the individual have
access to a phone to exercise his
right
to counsel
at the
first reasonable
opportunity.
the
applicant submits
that
the
first
reasonable
opportunity
was
in
the
back
of
the
scout
car.
the
officers testified that
privacy could not be afforded to the applicant in the
back of the car, given the in car camera system.

counsel to the applicant suggests
that he should have been at least given the opportunity
to
speak
with
counsel
from
the
back
of
the
cruiser
whether
or
not
it
was
a private
call.
they
point
to
the
decision
of
my
colleague
in
r
v.
elzain,

oj.
no.
522
as support for the proposition.
i don’t need to
decide
that issue in this case.
it was only
much
later
at
the
police
station
that
duty
counsel
was
contacted
on
the
applicant’s
behalf.

the delay in
facilitating the right to counsel continued after
transport when the applicant
was
lodged
in
a
cell
and
another
26
minutes
passed
before
the
first
call
to
duty counsel was placed at 2:56 a.m.,
almost two
hours after he was
initially detained.
none of
the
officer’s
notes
indicate
when
the
applicant
actually
spoke
to
a
lawyer,
therefore
the time of the call is unknown.

the crown bears the onus of
establishing a sufficient record of the interaction between the applicant and
the police.
the deficiencies in the
record in this case are similar to those identified by the court of appeal
in
r
v. noel,
2019 onca 860
and that lead the court to conclude that there had
been a significant breach of section 10(b) requiring the exclusion of the
evidence pursuant to section 24(2).

the delay in facilitating the
applicant’s access to counsel was unreasonable. further, the failure of the
officers to hold off questioning the applicant until after he had received
legal advice amounts to an additional stand alone violation of the applicant’s
section 10(b) rights.
remedy
section
24(2)
of
the
charter:
the
exclusion
of
evidence

in determining whether the
admission of evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute,
the court must review and balance three lines of inquiry with a “long-term,
forward-looking and societal perspective.”
the
three lines of inquiry can be summarized as:
(1)
the
seriousness
of
the
charter
-infringing
state
conduct;
(2)
the
impact
of
the
breach
on
the
charter
protected
interests
of
the
accused.
and
(3)
society’s
interest
in
the
adjudication
of
the
case
on
its
merits.
(i)
the
seriousness
of
the
charter-infringing
conduct

the
charter
breaches that
took place in this case were serious. they include breaches
of
sections
8,
9
and
10(b)
of
the
charter.
the
detention
and
subsequent
search of the applicant was unwarranted
and amounts to breaches of sections 8 and 9 of the
charter.
the failure to facilitate the applicant’s
right to counsel in a timely manner amounts
to
a
breach
of
section
10(b)
that
was
aggravated
by
the
failure
of
the
officers
to hold off
on asking him questions:
r v. grant,
2009 scc 32;
r v. gonzales,
2017 onca
543.

further,
the
applicant
was
not
read
rights
to
counsel
or
cautioned
upon
detention.
he
was
immediately
asked
potentially
incriminating
questions
and
subjected
to
a
warrantless
search
of
his
person
and satchel.
the
police then failed to facilitate
a
call
to counsel within a reasonable time
despite his immediate request to speak to a lawyer.

the police misconduct in this case falls on the
serious end of the spectrum.
the
cumulation of the numerous
charter
violations should weight heavily in
favour of exclusion.
the admission of
the evidence in
this case would send
the message
that the justice system
condones serious state misconduct. it does not.

they
were
also
some
additional
factors
that
aggravate
the
misconduct
in
this
case,
including the decision of the police to stop and search the applicant’s
acquaintances even though there was absolutely no basis whatsoever for doing
so. officer arakaza admitted
as
such
when
he
testified
before
me.
this
was
done
illegally
and
speaks
to
the
cavalier nature of the police in conducting the
detention
and search
of the applicant
and even
his
friends
who,
it
may
be
recalled,
agreed
to
be
searched
before
entering
the
ruby
soho club.
(ii)
the
impact
on
the
charter
protected
interests
of
the
accused

the
applicant
had
the
right
to
be
left
alone.
he
held
a
reasonable
expectation
that he would not be subjected to an arbitrary detention and
search while walking down the street.
further,
he was deprived of his constitutionally protected right to consult with counsel
in
a
timely
manner.
it
has
been
stated
by
our
courts
on
numerous
occasions
that the right to
counsel is a lifeline for detained persons, and the psychological value of
access to counsel without delay should not be underestimated.
(iii)
society’s
interest
in
the
adjudication
on
the
merits

where both the first and second
grant
factors
point to exclusion, the third
grant
factor
will rarely succeed:
r v. mcguffie,
2016 onca 365
at
para
63.

the firearm is real and reliable
evidence.
its exclusion guts the
crown’s case. guns represent a serious public safety issue in toronto.
gun violence is a serious concern
in
our
communities.
the
exclusion
of
this
kind

section
7
of
the
charter
and
lost
evidence

the applicant submits that his
section 7
charter
rights were violated by the selective muting of the
body worn cameras activated during his police interactions.
he specifically alleges that his right to
make full answer and defence was violated by the failure of the police to
obtain the name, contact information, a description of, or a statement
from
a
key
witness,
namely
the
bouncer
at
the
club
that
purportedly
turned
mr. yaqubi
away for refusing to be searched.
it
is this utterance that the officer points to as affording him grounds to detain
and search the applicant.

the
applicant
submits
that
the
identity
of
the
bouncer
and
the
statements
allegedly made by the bouncer are
relevant, essential evidence and should have been obtained and preserved by the
police.
furthermore, they submit that
the loss of these items is prejudicial to the applicant’s right to make full
answer and defence.

in
r
v.
la,
1997 canlii 309 (scc),

2
scr
680
the
supreme
court
established
that
when
a
relevant
piece of evidence is lost due to the state’s unacceptable negligence, an
accused’s right to disclosure under section 7 of the
charter
is violated
(paras. 20 – 22).
if the crown leads
no
evidence
as to why it
failed
to
disclose relevant
evidence to the defence
before
it was erased or destroyed, it will have failed to meet its burden to show that
the loss of the evidence was not due to unacceptable state negligence:
r v. dulude,
2004 canlii 30967

r v. mymryk,
2004 canlii 32042
(scj) at para.

in
r v. azfar,
 o.j. no. 2543
justice
porter held that it was inconceivable that
fair
investigative
practices
by
the
police
could include selective
muting
of
portions
of the
police
investigation.
the
result
is
that
bwc
footage
is
incomplete
and
inaccurate.
he found that the
muting of a conversation between two officers where they
discussed their grounds to
make
a
asd demand violated
section 7
of
the
charter.
his honour
held
that the
breathalyzer results were temporally, contextually and proximately related to
the section 7 violation and granted a remedy under section 24(2) of the
charter
as a result.
in
r v. bero,
2000 canlii 16956 (on ca),
 o.j. no. 4199
at para.
44, the
court of appeal explained that the integrity of the judicial process will be
put at risk where the conduct of the state undermines
the
fairness
of
the
trial
process
or
deliberately
frustrates
the
court’s
ability
to reach a
proper verdict.

furthermore,
even
if
the
crown
shows
that
there
was
no
unacceptable
negligence resulting in the loss of
evidence, there may still be a section 7 breach if the loss can be shown
to
be
so
prejudicial
to
the
right
to
make
full
answer
and
defence
that
it
impairs
the right to a fair trial:
r
v. bradford,

 o.j. no. 107
a para 4.
in
r v. bradford, o.j.
no.
107 the court
of appeal
for
ontario
emphasized that in deciding whether
or
not
unacceptable negligence leading to the loss of evidence should result in a stay
of proceedings,
it
is
important
that
the
analysis
focus
on
actual
prejudice
to
the
right
to
make
full answer and defence.
section
24(1):
a
stay
of
proceedings

the
police’s
failure
in
this
case
to
ensure
that
relevant
evidence
was
preserved
for disclosure
is
troubling.
preservation
of
relevant
evidence
is
imperative
for
an
accused
to make full answer and defence.

at a number of important junctures
during the investigation in this case, the arresting
officer
either
failed
to
turn
on,
or
muted,
his
bwc.
he
did
so
in
contravention
of the tps policy then governing the use
of bwc.
further, he did not get the
name or contact information from the bouncer or any other information that
would establish the identity of the bouncer.
there is therefore no basis to test the officer’s evidence as to what
was
or was
not said to the
officer
prior to him stopping
the
applicant.
the ability of the defence to test the
truthfulness of officer arakaza’s account of his discussions with the bouncer,
said to give him grounds to detain the applicant, has been compromised. the
evidence is of central importance to this case and we don’t have access to it
due to the decisions made by the officer.

further,
in
this
case
there
are
more
than
the
usual
reasons
to
test
the
credibility
of the
arresting
officer.
officer
arakaza
clearly
lied
to
his
supervising
sergeant
that
night
in relation
to
the
circumstances
of
the
applicant’s
detention
and
subsequent
arrest.
though the
officer cleared the applicant’s gun and found no bullet in the chamber he told
his supervising sergeant that the gun was loaded.
this is a significant lie designed to augment the seriousness of
the applicant’s criminality and the dangerousness of the situation. it calls
into question the officer’s credibility with respect to the central issue on
this
charter
application,
namely
his
observations
of
the
applicant
and
the
purported
basis for the initial detention.

even
if
the
crown
were
to
establish
that
the
muting
of
the
body-worn
cameras
was not deliberate, or due to
unacceptable negligence on the part of the officers, the muting of the audio is
prejudicial to the right to make full answer and defence.
the crux of the applicant’s
defence
relates
to
the
legality
of
the
detention
and
search
of
his
person.
the muting of the audio on the bwcs deprives the applicant and the court
of the ability to properly assess what grounds the officers had at the time
they detained and searched the applicant.

i have concluded that this is one
of those rare cases warranting a stay of proceedings.
the
ability
of
the
defence to
test the
truthfulness
of
the
officer’s
purported grounds for
detention amounts to a breach of his section 7 right to make full answer an
defence and warrants a stay of proceedings pursuant to section 24(1) of the
charter.
conclusion

i make an order pursuant to
section 24(2) of the
charter
excluding the evidence obtained during the
unlawful and constitutionally impermissible detention and search of the
applicant.
in the alternative, i
would stay the proceedings pursuant to section 24(1) of the
charter
having
regard to the breach of the applicant’s section 7 right to make full answer and
defence.
