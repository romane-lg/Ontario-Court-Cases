for Mr. Njei-Bentley
HANNA J.:
OVERVIEW
[
1
]
On October 28, 2023, members of the Ontario
Provincial Police responded to a call for a disabled vehicle stopped on the 401.
When police arrived the defendant, Bambot Njei-Bentley, was in an ambulance.
Police initially made an approved screening demand but soon after arrested Mr.
Njei-Bentley for impaired operation and made a demand for him to provide breath
samples into an approved instrument.
[
2
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley was transported to the Durham
Regional Police Division in Pickering. While at the station he spoke with
counsel and refused to provide samples of his breath.
[
3
]
The defendant stands charged with impaired
operation of a conveyance and refusing or failing to comply with a demand to
provide samples of his breath, contrary to sections 320.14(1)(a) and 320.15(1),
respectively of the
Criminal Code
. At his trial he brought an
application to exclude evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the
Charter
for
alleged violations of ss. 8, 9, and 10(b) of the
Charter
. Prior to
closing its case, the Crown invited an acquittal on the impaired operation charge.
[
4
]
These are my reasons addressing Mr. Njei-Bentley’s
various
Charter
arguments and whether the Crown has proven the remaining
count beyond a reasonable doubt.
THE
ISSUES
[
5
]
The following issues were raised at this trial:
1.
Did the police breach Mr. Njei-Bentley’s s. 8
Charter
right by searching his vehicle prior to his arrest.
2.
Did the police have reasonable and probable
grounds to arrest Mr. Njei-Bentley and make a breath demand. This issue is
relevant to whether the Crown has proven the validity of the demand beyond a
reasonable doubt and whether there were breaches of ss. 8 and 9 of the
Charter
.
3.
Did the police fail to comply with the
informational component of s. 10(b).
4.
Did the police fail in their s. 10(b)
implementational obligations by delaying facilitating contact with counsel.
5.
Did the police breach Mr. Njei-Bentley’s right
to retain and instruct counsel of choice, contrary to s. 10(b) of the
Charter
.
6.
Did the police breach Mr. Njei-Bentley’s s.
10(b)
Charter
right by failing to afford him another opportunity to
speak with counsel.
7.
Should any evidence be excluded pursuant to s.
24(2) of the
Charter
.
8.
Has the Crown proven the remaining elements of
the refuse charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
6
]
I will outline the evidence relevant to each of
these issues as I address them.
1) The section 8 issue relating to
the purported search of Mr. Njei-Bentley’s vehicle
[
7
]
While initially pleaded as part of Mr.
Njei-Bentley’s
Charter
application, once the evidence unfolded, the defendant
did not pursue the argument that the police breached s. 8 of the
Charter
by searching his vehicle prior to his arrest. The evidence of Police Constable
Church on this issue was that he looked into the vehicle without entering it to
ensure that there was no one else inside. Given the evidence heard and the
positions advanced by the parties, there is no basis to find a s. 8 breach
relating to this conduct.
2) The reasonable and probable
grounds issue: the validity of the demand, and sections 8 and 9 of the Charter
[
8
]
The defence submits that the arresting officer,
P.C. Church, only had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol consumption, which is
why he made an approved screening device (ASD) demand. The defence argues that
the police became frustrated by Mr. Njei-Bentley not understanding that demand
and “shortcut their investigation to an arrest based on their suspicions of
impairment.” According to the defence, absent a “fail” on an ASD, their were
insufficient grounds to arrest Mr. Njei-Bentley and make an intoxilyzer demand.
Absent a lawful demand, Mr. Njei-Bentley had no legal obligation to comply.
[
9
]
One of the elements of the offence the Crown
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is the existence of a valid demand:
R.
v. Khandakar
,
2024 ONCA 620
, at para.
18
;
R. v. Degiorgio
,
2011 ONCA
527
, at para.
43
. A breath demand will be valid only when the demanding officer
has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the suspect operated a
conveyance while his or her ability to operate it was impaired:
R. v. Hull
,
2016 ONSC 2267
, at paras.
5 – 6
;
Criminal Code
, s. 320.28(1).
[
10
]
The standard to make a breath demand and to effect
an arrest is reasonable and probable grounds. This standard does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even a prima facie
case. The test is met where, based on all the circumstances known to the
officer, “credibly-based probability replaces suspicion.” It is a lower threshold
than balance of probabilities:
R. v. Beaver
,
2022 SCC 54
, at paras.
72
(1)
& 72(6);
R. v. Bush
,
2010 ONCA 554
, at paras.
36 – 37
;
R. v.
Canary
,
2018 ONCA 304
, at para.
23
.
[
11
]
There is both a subjective and objective
component to the reasonable and probable ground standard. In assessing either
part of the test, the court is not limited to the arresting officer’s
articulated reasons for the arrest, though those reasons will be relevant to
assessing the officer’s credibility:
R. v. Fyfe
,
2023 ONCA 715
, at
paras.
54 - 62
.
[
12
]
Evidence about subjective grounds may come from
multiple sources, including the surrounding circumstances. The subjective
component of the test focuses on whether the arresting officer honestly
believed the suspect committed the offence:
Fyfe
, at para.
53
;
R. v.
R.M.J.T
.,
2014 MBCA 36
, at paras.
60-63
;
R. v. Dill
,
2009 ABCA 332
,
at paras.
6-7
.
[
13
]
The objective component looks at whether “a
reasonable person placed in the position of the officer would be able to
conclude that there were indeed reasonable and probable grounds for the
arrest”:
Bush
, at para.
38
;
Fyfe
, at paras.
54 - 55
. Accordingly,
the focus is not limited to the officer’s stated grounds but must include
consideration of the broader circumstances known to the officer at the time of
the arrest:
Fyfe
, at paras.
55 – 62
.
[
14
]
The only officer to testify who attended the
scene was the arresting officer, P.C. Church. He had only been a police officer
for three weeks at the time he conducted the investigation in this case. He
arrived on scene at 7:53 a.m.
[
15
]
I found P.C. Church to be a careful witness. His
evidence was not contradicted nor was it meaningfully shaken in
cross-examination.
[
16
]
He testified that when he arrived on seen he
spoke with a civilian, Jeremy Lumambiajo.
Mr.
Lumambiajo
advised P.C. Church of the following:
-
He observed a male slumped over the steering
wheel of a disabled vehicle.
-
He knocked on the window several times and the
male did not respond.
-
When he opened the door, he smelled an odour of
alcohol.
-
He believed that the male was intoxicated.
-
The male was already in the ambulance.
[
17
]
P.C. Church then attended the ambulance and
observed Mr. Njei-Bentley to be the male being attended to. The paramedic
advised the officer that other than Mr. Njei-Bentley most likely being
intoxicated, he was fine to transport.
[
18
]
P.C. Church asked Mr. Njei-Bentley what had
happened. Mr. Njei-Bentley responded that he did not know, he was out late, and
that he needed to go to the hospital. P.C. Church asked if Mr. Njei-Bentley had
had anything to drink and Mr. Njei-Bentley answered that he could not remember.
P.C. Osborn then asked Mr. Njei-Bentley when he had had his last drink and Mr.
Njei-Bentley answered that it was maybe around 11 but that he could not
remember. P.C. Church observed Mr. Njei-Bentley to have bloodshot glassy eyes,
and slurred speech. He also smelled an odour of alcohol on his breath. When
P.C. Osborne asked Mr. Njei-Bentley what time it was, Mr. Njei-Bentley indicated
that he did not know.
[
19
]
At 7:56 a.m., P.C. Church formed a suspicion
that that Mr. Njei-Bentley was impaired by alcohol and read him an approved
screening demand. In the conversation that followed, Mr. Njei-Bentley slurred
his words such that parts of his speech were unintelligible. P.C. Church also
observed that the odour of alcohol became much stronger. He arrested Mr.
Njei-Bentley at 7:59 a.m. after being told to do so by Sergeant Simpson.
[
20
]
Though he was directed to arrest Mr.
Njei-Bentley by a more senior officer, P.C. Church testified that he would have
done so regardless of this direction given that he believed he had reasonable
grounds to arrest Mr. Njei-Bentley for the offence of impaired operation. In
cross-examination he maintained that he had his own independent grounds to make
an arrest. I found P.C. Church to be a credible and sincere witness. I do not
doubt the genuineness of his evidence in this regard. In cross-examination he advised
that he had been attempting to give Mr. Njei-Bentley the benefit of the doubt. I
found the officer’s explanation regarding the additional indicia which
contributed to him forming his grounds for an arrest, following his having made
the ASD demand, to be reasonable and credible. Again, those observations were
an increased strength in the odour of alcohol and Mr. Njei-Bentley’s speech
being slurred at one point to the extent that it was unintelligible.
[
21
]
In closing arguments, defence counsel did not
really challenge the subjective aspect of the officer’s grounds and focused instead
on the objective component.  When I consider P.C. Church’s evidence in the context
of the circumstances known to him, I am satisfied he subjectively believed that
Mr. Njei-Bentley’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and that he
had grounds to arrest Mr. Njei-Bentley and make a breath demand.
[
22
]
I am also satisfied that P.C. Church’s belief
was objectively reasonable. In my view, his articulated reasons for his grounds
considered along with the information known by him which was provided by Mr.
Lumambiajo and the paramedic, easily satisfy the objective component of the reasonable
and probable grounds standard. The officer was not required to continue with
the ASD procedure prior to making an arrest if sufficient grounds for an arrest
were present:
R. v. Marrese
,
[2009] O.J. No. 4467 (SCJ), at para. 19
;
R.
v. Censoni,
[2001] O.J. No. 5189, at para. 50
. The defence suggested that that
officer’s decision to arrest was unreasonable in part because he had been aware
that Mr. Njei-Bentley had just woken up and there had been a potential medical
emergency. I disagree. The officer was “not required to undertake further
investigation to seek exculpatory facts or to rule out possible innocent
explanations for the events before making an arrest”:
Beaver
, at para.
72
(6).
[
23
]
When I consider the evidence in its entirety on
this issue, I conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that P.C. Church had
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that Mr. Njei-Bentley’s ability to
operate a conveyance was at least slightly impaired by the consumption of
alcohol:
Bush
, at para.
48
. There being no other concerns raised
regarding the validity of the breath demand, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that this element of the refuse offence has been proven by the Crown.
[
24
]
Furthermore, I find that Mr. Njei-Bentley was
neither arbitrarily detained nor subjected to an unreasonable search and
seizure. His sections 8 and 9
Charter
applications are dismissed.
3)
The alleged delay in informing Mr. Njei-Bentley of s. 10(b) rights
[
25
]
The defence alleges that the police breached his
s. 10(b)
Charter
right by unreasonably delaying informing him of his
right to counsel for 11 minutes following his arrest.
[
26
]
P.C. Church testified that three events accounted
for the 11-minute delay. First, he wished to get Mr. Njei-Bentley out of the
ambulance and walk him to his cruiser as this was a safer location to conduct
his investigation. Second, he conducted a safety search incident to arrest.
Third, when he first placed Mr. Njei-Bentley in the back of the police cruiser Mr.
Njei-Bentley complained that his handcuffs were very uncomfortable. In response
to this complaint the officer had Mr. Njei-Bentley exit the vehicle so that he
could re-adjust his handcuffs. “The right to counsel is to be provided
'immediately not instantaneously'. Police officers are not required to hand
cuff the accused with one hand and with the other hand read the right to
counsel from their notebooks”:
R. v. Fisk
,
2020 ONCJ 88
, at para.
51
;
R.
v. Ismail
,
[2023] O.J. No. 468, at paras. 61 - 62
; aff’d
2024 ONCA 945
, at
paras.
7 – 8
. Based on the record before me, I do not find a breach of the
informational component of s. 10(b). Furthermore, I note that as in
Fisk
and
Ismail
, the police did not elicit any evidence from Mr. Njei-Bentley
during the delay in providing him his rights to counsel. Accordingly, if I am
wrong and there was a technical breach of s. 10(b), in my view nothing of
consequence arises from it for the purposes of s. 24(2) of the
Charter
:
R.
v. Culotta
,
2018 ONCA 665
, at paras.
35 and 65
; aff’d
2018 SCC 57
.
4)
The alleged delay in contacting counsel
[
27
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley’s
Charter
materials allege
that the police unreasonably delayed facilitating contact with counsel. In
submissions, defence counsel advised that she was not pursuing this argument. Given
the evidence I heard, I consider counsel’s position to be reasonable. There was
not an unreasonable delay in contacting counsel in this case.
5) The
counsel of choice issue
[
28
]
The defence submits that the police interfered
with Mr. Njei-Bentley’s right to contact his counsel of choice by not
permitting him to speak with his brother. I disagree.
[
29
]
When a detainee requests to speak with a third
party for the purpose of assisting in contacting counsel of choice the police
are required to facilitate this:
R. v. Beals
,
2020 ONSC 996
, at paras.
70
;
R. v. Kumarasamy
,
[2002] O.J. No. 303 at paras. 25-26
.
[
30
]
However, the police’s obligation to facilitate
contact with counsel of choice and the detainee’s responsibility to take
reasonable steps to contact counsel work in tandem. In other words, the steps
the police are required to take in contacting a lawyer of choice is dependent
upon the reasonable diligence exercised by the detainee in his or her efforts
to connect with counsel of choice. Both obligations are assessed on a
reasonableness standard:
R. v. Edwards
,
2024 ONCA 135
, at para.
36
;
R.
v. Manchulenko
,
2013 ONCA 543
, at para.
65
;
R. v. Willier
,
2010 SCC
37
, at paras.
33
,
R. v. O’Shea
,
2019 ONSC 1514
at paras.
30 – 35
.
[
31
]
A portion of the audio from the in-car camera
was entered as an exhibit at trial (between 015:17 – 016:20 on the player). It
captures the period when Mr. Njei-Bentley first arrived at the police station. An
officer can be heard asking Mr. Njei-Bentley who he is calling. Mr.
Njei-Bentley responds, “lawyer.” The officer then indicates that they would
take the number down because they need to speak with the lawyer too. Mr.
Njei-Bentley then says, “I’ll call my brother if he doesn’t pick up cuz…” The
officer tells Mr. Njei-Bentley he will have reasonable use of the phone and
asks if his brother is a lawyer. Mr. Njei-Bentley responds that his brother is
not a lawyer but that he’ll know how to direct him. He also states, “it has
been a long time I didn’t talk to him, so I can call my brother.” The officer
then says that they will make those arrangements. I consider this interaction to
be consistent with Mr. Njei-Bentley attempting to contact his lawyer and explaining
to the officer that he would wish to call his brother if his lawyer did not
answer the phone.
[
32
]
Following the interaction captured on the in-car
camera, Mr. Njei-Bentley was brought before the booking sergeant. A portion of
the booking video, between 8:32 a.m. and 8:40:34, was played in court. The
video shows Mr. Njei-Bentley asking to speak with his brother. P.C. Church
states that Mr. Njei-Bentley has also provided the name and number of a lawyer.
The booking sergeant explains to Mr. Njei-Bentley that if he needs to go through
his brother to speak with a lawyer the officers will make those arrangements.
The officers then advise Mr. Njei-Bentley that they will call his brother on
his behalf. Eventually, the booking sergeant clarifies with Mr. Njei-Bentley
whether he would like for his brother to know that he was in the police’s care
or whether he would like to get a lawyer from him. At this point Mr.
Njei-Bentley responded, “no, I would like him to know that I am in your care.” The
booking sergeant then advised Mr. Njei-Bentley that they could do that for him.
Despite Mr. Njei-Bentley’s insistence on contacting his brother, the result of
this interaction is that he clarified for the officers that the reason he
wished to do so was for the purpose of letting his brother know he was at the
police station rather than to facilitate contact with his lawyer.
[
33
]
P.C. Church testified that Mr. Njei-Bentley
provided him with the name and contact information for the lawyer, Adetayo
Akimyemi. Mr. Njei-Bentley retrieved this information from his phone. He spoke
privately with this lawyer between 8:55 a.m. and 8:59 a.m.
[
34
]
P.C. Church testified that following the call
he confirmed with Mr. Njei-Bentley that he was satisfied with the call. He
acknowledged he did not write in his notes that he had done this but maintained
that he was sure that he had done so because he had an independent recollection
of the conversation and because doing so was part of his training. The
significance of an omission in an officer’s notes must be assessed on a case-by-case
basis:
R. v. Machado
,
2010 ONSC 277
, at paras.
120 – 124
;
R. v. Brown
,
2014 ONSC 1383
, at paras.
19 – 27
. In this case, I find that P.C. Church was an
honest and careful witness. I accept his uncontradicted evidence on this point.
He was not shaken in cross-examination, and I do not consider it unreasonable
that he as a junior officer would recall that he acted in accordance with his
training in what was one of his first investigations. Nor did I find that his
credibility was undermined because he omitted to include this detail in his
notes. Again, given his inexperience it is understandable that his notes were
imperfect.
[
35
]
Finally, I observe that there is no evidence
that Mr. Njei-Bentley requested to contact a different lawyer than the one he
spoke with.
[
36
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley bears the onus of establishing
a breach of the implementational duties under s. 10(b):
R. v. Van Binnendyk
,
2007 ONCA 537
, at para.
11
;
R. v. Duerksen
,
2018 BCCA 46
at paras.
25 - 41
;

at para.
52
;
R. v. Julom
,
2022 ABCA 198
at paras.
100 – 104
.
This includes the burden of showing that he only spoke to the lawyer he did
because he misunderstood his rights:
R. v. Ghotra
,
2020 ONCA 373
, at
paras.
38 – 40
. For the reasons given, I find that Mr. Njei-Bentley has not
demonstrated that the police failed to facilitate contact with his counsel of
choice.
6) The refusal to permit a second
consultation with counsel
[
37
]
The defence argues that the police infringed s.
10(b) of the
Charter
by failing to afford him a second opportunity to
consult with counsel.
[
38
]
Generally, a single consultation with counsel
with be constitutionally sufficient. There are three non-exhaustive categories
of exceptional circumstances that can trigger a police obligation to provide a
detainee with a second opportunity to speak with counsel:
(1) the police
invite the accused to take part in non-routine procedures that counsel would
not consider at the time of the initial consultation;
(2) there is a
change in jeopardy that could affect the adequacy of the advice received during
the initial consultation; and
(3) there is
reason to question the detainee's understanding of his rights.
R. v.
Sinclair
,
2010 SCC 35
, at paras.
49 – 52
;
R. v.
Lafrance
,
2022 SCC 32
, at para.
72
.
[
39
]
There was no suggestion by the defence that
either the first or second category was in play at this trial.
[
40
]
Regarding the third category, this can arise in
situations where the police have either undermined the legal advice the
detainee has received or damaged the detainee’s confidence in the lawyer they
spoke to. Additionally, this can occur when there are objective indications
that the consultation was deficient in a material way such that there are
reasons to question the detainee’s understanding of his or her rights. General
confusion or a need for help is not sufficient to require an additional
consultation:
Sinclair
, at paras.
52 – 53
;
Lafrance
, at para.
86
.
Nor is a request, without more, sufficient to retrigger the s. 10(b) right to
counsel:
Sinclair
, at para.
65
. An assessment of the third category
requires a broad inquiry into all the circumstances:
Lafrance
, at para.
79
.
[
41
]
There is no evidence that the police either undermined
the advice Mr. Njei-Bentley received from counsel or weakened his confidence in
his lawyer.
[
42
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley, while in the breath room,
repeatedly asked to speak with his lawyer and made multiple references to
having his lawyer present. He also repeatedly told the breath technician that
he did not understand his rights. Notwithstanding these observations, when I consider
Mr. Njei-Bentley’s entire interaction with the police, I do not believe Mr.
Njei-Bentley’s claim that he did not understand his rights.
[
43
]
When P.C. Church read Mr. Njei-Bentley his
rights to counsel, Mr. Njei-Bentley indicated he understood. The police facilitated
contact with Mr. Njei-Bentley’s counsel of choice, after which P.C. Church
confirmed that Mr. Njei-Bentley was satisfied with the call.
[
44
]
With regards to Mr. Njei-Bentley’s interactions
with the breath technician, P.C. Lang, I find it significant that Mr.
Njei-Bentley responded inconsistently regarding his understanding of the breath
demand and the consequences for not complying with that demand.
[
45
]
At 9:11 a.m. P.C. Lang explained to Mr.
Njei-Bentley that he was making a lawful demand pursuant to the
Criminal code
of Canada
. Mr. Njei-Bentley nodded along. The officer then explained that the
demand compelled Mr. Njei-Bentley to provide samples of his breath and that if
he did not do so he would be charged with refusing to provide a breath sample. Mr.
Njei-Bentley responded, “ok.” The officer then asked again if Mr. Njei-Bentley
understood there were consequences to not providing samples and Mr.
Njei-Bentley again, responded, “okay.” Based on the officer’s clear
explanations and Mr. Njei-Bentley’s verbal responses and nodding it is clear to
me that Mr. Njei-Bentley understood the nature of the demand and the
consequences for non-compliance. Immediately after, at 9:12, P.C. Lang again
read the breath demand and asked Mr. Njei-Bentley if he understood. Mr.
Njei-Bentley responded, “no.”
[
46
]
When asked what part of the demand he did not
understand, Mr. Njei-Bentley responded that he felt he had been mistreated by
the police. When the officer asked Mr. Njei-Bentley if he wished to read the
demand himself Mr. Njei-Bentley refused, indicating that he was not a lawyer.
This conveyed to me that Mr. Njei-Bentley was not interested in seeking
clarification about what the officer was saying to him. Between 9:13:36 and
9:13:45, the officer then again asked Mr. Njei-Bentley whether he understood
that he was requiring him to provide samples and that if he refused to comply
he could be charged with a criminal offence. Mr. Njei-Bentley indicated he
understood all of this. At 9:18, P.C. Lang again read the breath demand to Mr.
Njei-Bentley and asked him if he understood. This time Mr. Njei-Bentley
responded, “I do not understand.” Despite having indicated at 9:11 and 9:13
that he understood the nature of the breath demand Mr. Njei-Bentley reverted at
9:18 to advising the officer that he did not understand. Between 9:19:20 – 9:20:05,
P.C. Lang asked Mr. Njei-Bentley if he understood that by refusing to provide
samples of his breath, he would be charged with an offence Mr. Njei-Bentley
claimed to not understand. This response was clearly unbelievable given Mr.
Njei-Bentley’s previous responses. I note later during the breath room
interaction Mr. Njei-Bentley returned to acknowledging that he did understand
the nature of the demand and that there would be criminal consequences if he
refused to provide samples of his breath.
[
47
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley’s assertions that he did not
understand the breath demand or the consequences for not complying with that
demand were in my view transparent attempts to delay or avoid providing samples
of his breath. Given that context, I am persuaded that Mr. Njei-Bentley’s
repeated assertions that he did not understand his rights were similarly an
attempt to avoid providing breath samples.
[
48
]
Additionally, while Mr. Njei-Bentley repeatedly
asserted to P.C. Lang that he did not understand his rights, his only explanations
regarding this related to expressing his displeasure regarding how he perceived
he had been mistreated by the police and explaining that he had never been in a
situation like this before.
[
49
]
Furthermore, I do not find that Mr. Njei-Bentley
was indicating that he believed he was entitled to have his lawyer present.
Instead, I find that he expressed that he wanted to have his counsel attend.
There was no evidence led that Mr. Njei-Bentley was advised by counsel that he
had a right to have a lawyer present prior to providing breath samples: see
similarly,
R. v. Hunter
,
2023 ABCA 201
, at para.
23
. Furthermore, when Mr.
Njei-Bentley first indicated that he wanted his lawyer present, P.C. Lang
advised him that his lawyer would not be attending. Mr. Njei-Bentley responded,
“okay” and did not appear to express any surprise by the that.
[
50
]
I have considered the entire record before me of
Mr. Njei-Bentley’s interactions with the police as well as his particular
vulnerabilities. He is a racial minority who advised the police he had never
been arrested before. At the same time, he is not especially young, being in
his 30s, and he presented on video as a confident person, who spoke English
fluently. He was also not shy to assert himself – indeed, he repeatedly told
the police he wished to remain silent. Furthermore, despite Mr. Njei-Bentley’s
claims during the breath video that he was mistreated by the police I was
presented with no evidence to that effect. The evidence of P.C. Church, P.C.
Lang, and the videos filed show that the police were polite and courteous with Mr.
Njei-Bentley throughout their interactions with him.
[
51
]
When I consider all the circumstances, I do not
find that there were objective indicators that Mr. Njei-Bentley did not
understands his s. 10(b) rights. On the contrary, I find that Mr. Njei-Bentley’s
claims to not understand his rights were insincere and attempts to avoid
providing breath samples.
[
52
]
I do not find that the police were obliged to
permit Mr. Njei-Bentley to have another consultation with counsel prior to
continuing with the breath procedure.
7) Section 24(2) of the Charter
[
53
]
In view of my findings on the
Charter
applications, it is unnecessary to consider s. 24(2) of the
Charter
. I
will briefly indicate that if there was a s. 10(b) breach relating to the delay
in reading Mr. Njei-Bentley his rights to counsel, I would consider this to be
a very minor breach which had no impact on Mr. Njei-Bentley. In my view,
excluding the actus reus of the offence would not be appropriate.

Has the Crown proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt?
[
54
]
Mr. Njei-Bentley is presumed innocent. It is the
Crown’s onus to prove each of the essential elements of the offence charged beyond
a reasonable doubt.
[
55
]
To prove the actus reus of the offence, the
Crown must prove that the police made a lawful demand under either s. 320.27 or
320.28, and that the accused either "fail[ed]" or
"refus[ed]" to comply. In cases involving the refusal branch of the
offence, the accused must be proved to have refused "unequivocally":

;
Khandakar
,
at para.
18
.
[
56
]
The jurisprudence is divided about whether the
mens rea for the offence requires proof that the accused intentionally refused
to provide a breath sample or whether the Crown need only prove that the
accused would know their conduct would have that result:

).
[
57
]
As mentioned earlier, the only argument raised
with respect to the validity of the demand was the challenge to the demanding
officer’s grounds. For the reasons already given, I have resolved that issue in
favour of the Crown. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a
valid demand.
[
58
]
The breath room video also makes it abundantly
clear that Mr. Njei-Bentley unequivocally refused or failed to provide samples
of his breath. He repeatedly indicated that he would not provide a sample despite
being explained that he was required to do so and the criminal consequences of
failing to do so. He refused to take the mouthpiece when it was handed to him.
He also refused to blow into the machine when it was presented to him. There
was nothing ambiguous about his words or actions.
[
59
]
The Crown has proven the mens rea for the
offence regardless of which approach from the jurisprudence is used. Applying
the more stringent approach, Mr. Njei-Bentley’s words and actions make it clear
beyond a reasonable doubt that he intentionally was refusing to provide samples
of his breath. At no point did Mr. Njei-Bentley make any attempt to provide a
sample or indicate that he was willing to do so.
[
60
]
“A ‘reasonable excuse’ refers to something
outside the essential elements of an offence. An excuse speaks to whether an
accused should be held accountable for what otherwise would be a crime”:
R.
v. Armstrong
,
2011 ONCA 709
(Ont. C.A.), at para.
9
. The only potential
reasonable excuse raised in this case is that Mr. Njei-Bentley expressed a desire
to speak with counsel again prior to providing breath samples. I find that he did
not have a right to do so. Any assumption he may have had in that regard would
not afford him a reasonable excuse: see
R. v. Gentile
,
2012 ONSC 4898
,
at para.
49
;
R. v. Van Deelen
,
2009 ONCA 53
;
R. v. Kumar
,
2016
ONSC 7928
, at para.
102
. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Njei-Bentley did not have a reasonable excuse to refuse to comply.
[
61
]
In summary, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Njei-Bentley intentionally and unequivocally refused or failed to
comply with a valid demand to provide samples of his breath and that he did so
without a reasonable excuse.
CONCLUSION
[
62
]
For the reasons given, the
Charter
applications are dismissed, and Mr. Njei-Bentley is found guilty of failing or
refusing to comply with a lawful demand to provide samples of his breath,
contrary to
s. 320.15(1)
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
63
]
The Crown acknowledges that it cannot prove the
impaired operation charge. That count is accordingly dismissed.
