On May 29, 2023, I found Sean Done guilty of accessing
child pornography contrary to
s. 163.1(4.1)
of the
Criminal Code
and the
matter went over for sentencing.

This matter has had a rather protracted history,
including a post-conviction s. 11(b) application and a delay in sentencing to
allow the trial to be re-opened for Mr. Done to bring a second s. 8
Charter
application. [See para. 93 of my Reasons for Decision on Section 8

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
OFFENCES
[
4
]
On May 27, 2021, police executed a search
warrant at Mr. Done’s home and seized a number of devices including Mr. Done’s
cellphone.
[
5
]
That cellphone was analyzed, and over 800 unique
images and videos of child pornography [hereafter referred to as child sexual
abuse material or CSAM] were located in the caches of Mr. Done’s cellphone. Mr.
Done had accessed this child sexual abuse material using his cellphone. While some
of these videos/images were accessed outside the timeframe of the information,
I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all of these videos/images were
accessed by Mr. Done. Indeed, I found that Mr. Done was a regular and
consistent consumer of child sexual abuse material.
[
6
]
The images and videos in Exhibit # 7 are
particularly vile and degrading. They show children as young as 3 to 8 years
old, dancing naked, being anally and vaginally penetrated with a penis or
fingers, performing oral sex on adult men including to the point of ejaculation,
most with clear views of the children’s faces. Many different children were
victimized in these videos and images of sexual abuse.
[
7
]
The analysis of the cellphone also located a
number of chats that provided aggravating features of Mr. Done’s offending
behaviour that I found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt:
(1)
The chats [see Exhibits # 9-17 in the trial] make
it very clear that Mr. Done was not just actively accessing images and videos
of child sexual abuse and links to those images, he was sharing and trading links
to child sexual abuse material. [More details of these chats can be found in my
Reasons for Judgment (Trial) dated June 21, 2023.]
(2)
In one chat Mr. Done explained that he usually
likes girls around 12 but he could go younger “if she’s fun”. [See Exhibit 15A]
(3)
In another chat, Mr. Done enthusiastically
followed along as another individual recounted a sexual experience with that
person’s 12-year-old niece. [See Exhibit # 15B]
(4)
In the chats, Mr. Done demonstrated himself to
be very knowledgeable in the subject matter, willing to counsel and help other
like-minded individuals. In one particular chat, Mr. Done counselled a person
who identified as a 13-year-old girl on how to access child sexual abuse
material on the Internet. In this chat, Mr. Done acknowledged the illegality of
his actions, but that this did not stop him and other like-minded people.
Indeed, Mr. Done explained how to copy and paste the links to the videos of
child sexual abuse material to avoid detection by using a “safe” browser. [See
Exhibit # 14]
(5)
The chats demonstrated
Mr. Done’s
familiarity with how links to illicit images of child sexual abuse get shut
down by Mega (one of the websites where Mr. Done accessed child sexual abuse
material) due to illegal content.
[
8
]
In the Keep notes section of Mr. Done’s cellphone,
Mr. Done stored and categorized links to child sexual abuse material. While this
section of his phone only had two active links when examined by police, Mr.
Done explained during one of the chats recovered from his phone that he had
“nuked” his collection of videos and links. Given his regular use, and his
demonstrated knowledge and interest in child sexual abuse material, it is clear
to me that Mr. Done ordinarily kept a collection of videos and links of child
sexual abuse material.
IMPACT ON VICTIMS
[
9
]
While I have not heard from the children who
were victimized in the sexual abuse images/videos and re-victimized when those images/videos
were accessed by Mr. Done, it is clear that having their images viewed and available
for the world to access, in perpetuity on the Internet, intensifies the harms they
suffered and extends this harm into adulthood. [See
R. v. Pike
,
2024
ONCA 608
at para.
144]
[
10
]
After referencing the Supreme Court’s decision
in
R. v. Sharpe
,
2001 SCC 2
, Chief Justice Tulloch summarized the harm
caused to children by those who choose to consume child sexual abuse material:
Sharpe
explains
that Parliament criminalized possessing
child pornography because the perpetrators of this offence violate children’s
dignity, invade their privacy, inflict severe emotional harm, instigate
producers to abuse children to meet the demand for child pornography, risk
inciting and facilitating other offences against children, and perpetuate
pernicious messages that undermine children’s humanity and equality…
…Because
child pornography depicting real children “cannot come into existence without
[their] exploitation and abuse” (
Booth
, at para. 41), perpetrators
“possess … crime scene images of child sexual abuse” or exploitation:
R.
v. Hughes
,
2014 ONCJ 231
, at para.
24
;
see
Sharpe
, at para.
169
…
…[P]eople
who possess images of the abused and exploited children directly invade
children’s privacy. This privacy violation is “extreme”:
Sharpe
, at
para.
241
…
…
[P]eople who possess child pornography inflict severe emotional harm on
children. “It takes great strength and courage to survive sexual violence as a
child” because of the myriad physical and emotional harms that it causes:
Friesen
,
at para. 59 (internal quotation omitted). People who possess child pornography
make the challenging path of recovery for children much steeper by transforming
the initial exploitation and violence of the production into a continuing
violation. After the trauma of the production of the recordings of their
victimization, children suffer further pain when they learn that unknown
perpetrators have accessed and can view those recordings:
Sharpe
,
at para.
92
;
R. v. Snowden
,
2023 ONCA 768
,
432 C.C.C. (3d) 52
, at
para.
93
…
…People
who possess child pornography also cause distinct additional harm. They make
children feel powerless because they cannot destroy or control the
dissemination of child pornography that is posted online, leading them to fear
that perpetrators will recognize them in person and target them for additional
abuse:
D.G.F.
, at para. 25;
R.G.
, at para. 21…
…[P]eople
who possess child pornography “instigate the production and distribution of
child pornography” and, thus, the sexual abuse and exploitation of
children:
R. v. Stroempl
(1995),
1995 CanLII 2283 (ON CA)
,
105 C.C.C. (3d) 187 (Ont.
C.A.)
, at p. 191
;
see
Sharpe
, at paras.
28, 92, 166, 209, 235
.
Their willingness to acquire child pornography “necessarily creates a market
for the … exploitation of children” (
R. v. Liddington
(1997), 18
W.A.R. 394, at p. 403) and, thus, “adds to the scale of human misery” (
R. v.
Toomer
, [2001] 2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 8, at para. 6) and fuels a “cycle of abuse”
in which producers continue abusing existing victims and seek out new victims (
J.S.
,
at para. 101 (citation omitted))…
…[P]ossessing
and viewing child pornography can incite perpetrators to commit and facilitate
their commission of other sexual offences against children. To begin with, it
leads them to deny and minimize the wrongfulness of, rationalize and normalize,
and even fantasize about sexually exploiting children:
Sharpe
, at
paras.
87-89, 200-203
…
…[P]eople
who possess child pornography perpetuate pernicious messages that attack
children’s humanity and equality. Children have “absolute dignity and infinite
value” and deserve equal respect:
Granovsky v. Canada (Minister of
Employment and Immigration)
,
2000 SCC 28
,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 703
, at paras.
56-57
(quotation omitted)
; see also
Friesen
, at paras. 42, 65. Our
society’s future depends on respecting these principles so that children can
grow healthily from a position of vulnerability by virtue of their age,
dependency, and need, into adulthood and leadership:
Friesen
, at
para. 1….
Child
pornography inverts these values by “perpetuat[ing] lies about children’s
humanity”:
Sharpe
, at para.
183
. It lies to children by normalizing
their sexual abuse and exploitation:
Sharpe
, at para.
205
. It also
lies to adults. By falsely depicting children seeming to participate in their
own exploitation, it erases children’s vulnerability and wrongly suggests they
can consent, or that their exploitation is not a real crime: Sabine K. Witting,
“The ‘greyscale’ of ‘child pornography’: of mangas, avatars and schoolgirls:
Part 2” (2018) 24 C.T.L.R. 73, at pp. 79-80…
[See
Pike
,
at
paras.
144-156]
Possessing and accessing are
equivalent
[
11
]
In my view, possessing and accessing child
sexual abuse material have become synonymous. Both require the offender to locate,
select and view the child sexual abuse material on the Internet.
[
12
]
While the offender convicted of possession possesses
the CSAM file on his device, the offender who accesses such material uses a
link to a host website to view the image. As Mr. Done did in this case, the
offender who accesses a video on the Internet can save a link to their
favourite video, which they can then access and watch whenever they wish. Like
possession, accessing and saving a link is a continuing choice because they can
retain it for a period of time. While it is true that links can become disabled
from time to time, making those videos no longer available to view, I do not
see how this should be a basis for treating possessing child sexual abuse
material as worse than accessing it.
[
13
]
Those who possess the actual file and those who
access the file can share and trade child sexual abuse material – with the
possessors sharing or trading the actual file and accessors sharing or trading a
link to the file.
[
14
]
Both offenders who possess child sexual abuse
material and offenders who access it fuel the demand and cause the same harms.
BACKGROUND OF SEAN DONE
[
15
]
Sean Done is 40 years old and has no criminal
record. He was 36 years old when he committed the offence.
[
16
]
As his grandmother described, Mr. Done grew up
with the challenges of ADHD and a very unpredictable childhood home life, which
included physical and verbal abuse against his mother from various men who
lived or associated with her.
[
17
]
Mr. Done consistently worked through his teens
and early 20s.  He graduated high school on the honour roll.
[
18
]
After studying at Algonquin College, Mr. Done attended
the University of Ottawa and graduated with an Honours B.A. in English and music.
He then moved to Toronto and completed his Bachelor of Education at OISE (University
of Toronto).
[
19
]
After graduating Teacher’s College, Mr. Done
gained employment with the Toronto District School Board, starting in 2017 as a
supply teacher.
[
20
]
Mr. Done lost his employment after being charged
with the offence for which has been convicted. I understand that he is now
working for a fund-raising company.
[
21
]
Mr. Done has the strong support of his most of
his family, including his wife and grandmother. He continues to live with his
wife. They do not have any children.
[
22
]
When the pandemic hit, he struggled “like never
before” with managing the stress of life and his job.
[
23
]
Mr. Done received many positive reviews from his
students in his Teacher Candidate Evaluations and in his yearbooks.
[
24
]
At the time of sentencing submissions, Mr. Done
had been seeing Dr. James Cantor, a registered clinical psychologist and sexual
behaviour research scientist since June 2021 and had attended 54 sessions with
the doctor as of March 18, 2024. I include some of the key points from Dr.
Cantor’s letter:
(1)
Whereas some individuals minimize or deny the
thoughts and feelings that motivated their actions, Mr. Done worked over the
course of his sessions with the doctor to confront and challenge them directly.
Mr. Done has and continues to develop insight into himself and his actions. He
has worked diligently from the beginning of therapy to understand his actions
and improve himself.
(2)
After having worked with him in long-term
therapy, Dr. Cantor is of the opinion that Mr. Done does not exhibit factors
that would suggest elevations in risks to reoffend. In particular, Mr. Done’s
efforts to confront and address the awkwardness of the changes in his social
relationships bode well for his future.
[
25
]
In addition, Mr. Done has been assessed by Dr.
Julian Gojer, a forensic psychiatrist. While I have reviewed and considered the
entire report and all materials provided, I have included a few relevant
portions of Dr. Gojer’s report:
(1)
When discussing the offence, Mr. Done explained
how he started accessing child sexual abuse material of very young children:
In
his
30s
he
started
looking
into
less
mainstream
genres
of
pornography
such
as
“step
family
fantasy
stuff.”
He
later
started
using
the
app
“kik”
and
joined
groups
where
users
shared
pornography
files. He found the
“taboo material and forbidden acts
generated
an
anxious
energy
and
found
it
to
be
appealing”.
He
believes
that
the
videos
depicting
stepfamily
members
started
“an
incremental
decline”
to
the
underage
material
that
he
later
accessed
as
he
started
looking
for
content
that
involved
sex
between
a
sexually
experienced
and
sexually
inexperienced
person which
often
involved teenagers.
The kik
groups
shared
material
of
teenagers
both
over
and
under
the
age
of
18.
The
age
he was
looking for
gradually
decreased and “I told
myself
as
long as
it
presented
like everyone was
having fun it was
okay.”
Mr. Done said that
he
feels
ashamed when
he thinks
about how
he allowed
himself to access
the
underage
material
and
that
he
knows
minors
cannot
provide
true
consent.
Looking
back,
he
sees
that
the
children
involved
in
the
pornography
viewed
by
him
had
been
abused
when
the
pornography
was made.
…
“I told myself that everyone in the video had
to
be
enjoying
what
was
happening
and
cognizant
of
it,
but
I
was
fooling
myself because
I
know
that
minors
don’t
have
the
cognition
to
understand
what’s
happening.
I understand
that
kids
cannot
give
consent.
I
now
think
about
the
fact
that
there
are
real
victims
and
that
they
have
to
suffer
with
the
fact
that
people
have
seen
them
in
these
acts.”
…
Further
since
meeting
me,
and
in
discussions
with
Dr.
Cantor,
he
has
learned
how
he
had
cognitive
distortions
and has
begun
learning
techniques
how
to
dismantle
them.
He
has also
begun
to
be
open
with
his
partner
and
has
made
full
disclosure
of
his
thoughts,
urges
and
fantasies.
(2)
Growing up, Mr. Done’s mother struggled with
crack cocaine use. Despite her struggles, she was very protective of him, and
he did not experience any type of abuse or negative treatment from her
partners, although be bore witness to the abusive treatment of his mother by them.
(3)
Mr. Done is currently taking medication to
assist with his ADHD diagnosis.
(4)
Dr. Gojer arranged for phallometric testing with
Dr. Monik Kalia. That testing revealed that Mr. Done’s largest response during
the erotic preference testing was given to younger child females (ages 6-8)
followed by older child females (ages 9-11) and then younger child males (ages
6-8). I understand that these results have been shared with Mr. Done’s wife.
(5)
Given the phallometric testing results, and his
offending behaviour, Mr. Done was diagnosed as suffering from pedophilia. Dr.
Gojer noted that this has been limited to the Internet and added:
This pedophilia is nonexclusive
as
he
also
has
an
erotic
interest
in
adults
and
has
expressed
himself sexually
with
adult females
and has been
having
a
regular
sexual relationship with his wife. He has
not had any hands-on sexual contact with children.
(6)
Dr. Gojer found no evidence of any other mental
illness or disorder.
(7)
He found Mr. Done to be at a low risk to
reoffend. As Dr. Gojer explained:
Mr.
Done
did
not
hesitate
to
do
phallometric
testing
when
asked
to
do
so.
He
was
accepting
of
the
diagnosis.
He
indicated
that
he
was
in
therapy
with
a
Dr.
James
Cantor and a review
of Dr. Cantor’s report indicates
excellent
participation
in psychotherapy.
Mr.
Done
has
no
history of
any hands-on
offending
against
children.
There
is
no
history
of
any
prior
accusations,
charges
or
convictions
related
to
children.
He
is
accepting
of
his
diagnosis
and
that
he
needs
treatment.
He
and
his
wife
continue
to
relate
well
sexually.
He
has
no
complicating
major
mental
illness,
psychopathy
or
antisocial
personality
traits.
He
has
ceased
using
pornography
and
his
sexual
outlets
are
being
directed
towards
his wife.
He is
not
antisocial,
sees the moral
and legal wrongfulness
of his
actions
and
has
the
ability
to
refrain
from
using
any
materials
that
are
illegal
and related to children.
POSITION OF THE PARTIES
[
26
]
Ms. Donohue, on behalf of the Crown, has sought
a penitentiary sentence of 3 years, plus the following ancillary orders:
1)
An order requiring that Mr. Done provide a sample of his DNA
for the national DNA databank (The offence of accessing child pornography is a
primary designated offence.)
2)
An
order under
section 490.012(3)
of the
Criminal Code
that Mr. Done comply
with the
Sexual Offender Information Registration
Act, for 20 years,
which is the legislated minimum duration.
3)
A
s. 161 prohibition order specific to technology, for 5 years
[
27
]
Mr. Bytensky, on behalf of Mr. Done, submitted that
a conditional sentence up to the maximum length, followed by a lengthy period
of probation is appropriate. In the alternative, if a conditional sentence was
rejected, Mr. Bytensky argued that a jail sentence in the intermittent range
that allowed Mr. Done to work would be appropriate. Counsel for Mr. Done
suggested that the terms of a s. 161 order could be incorporated into a
probation order. Finally, Mr. Bytensky opposed the imposition of a SOIRA order,
although as a secondary position, he asked that I impose the minimum duration.
PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING
[
28
]
The fundamental purpose of any criminal sentence is to protect
society, contribute to respect for the law and help maintain a just, peaceful,
and safe society.
[
29
]
Sentencing judges attempt to achieve this goal by imposing just
sanctions that address one or more of the sentencing objectives enumerated in the
Criminal Code
, including denunciation, general and specific deterrence, separation
from society where necessary, rehabilitation and promoting a sense of
responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgment of the harm they have caused.
[
30
]
The fundamental principle of sentencing is to impose a sanction
that is proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed, and the degree
of responsibility of the person who committed them.
[
31
]
The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly
individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It
involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. [See
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
at para.
58]
Denunciation and Deterrence
[
32
]
The primary sentencing objectives when
sentencing an individual for possessing or accessing child sexual abuse
material must be denunciation and deterrence. The sentences must reflect the
gravity and degree of responsibility of those who choose to possess or access child
sexual abuse material. Chief Justice Tulloch explained:
Parliament has also
recognized the gravity of this offence by directing courts via
s. 718.01
of
the
Criminal Code
to prioritize denunciation and deterrence.
Prioritizing denunciation communicates that perpetrators’ sexual exploitation
of children is intolerable and combats their attempts to minimize their conduct
as harmless or victimless:
Inksetter
, at para. 16;
Friesen
,
at para. 105;
Kwok (2007)
, at para. 58. It sends a strong message
that children are people with infinite value and dignity whose healthy
development adults have a responsibility to promote, rather than property for
perpetrators to acquire and exploit as if they were slaves to the perpetrators’
whims. Likewise, prioritizing general deterrence is important because, while
the certainty of detection is generally more likely to deter than the severity
of penalties (
R. v. Nur
,
2015 SCC 15
, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para.
113
), possession of child pornography is a difficult offence to detect. By
imposing stricter sentences, courts compensate for the difficulty of detection
by warning would-be perpetrators that, while there is a chance they might
escape detection, they will face severe consequences if caught:
R. v.
Lynch-Staunton
,
[2012] O.J. No. 313 (S.C.), at paras. 56-57
. Many people
who possess child pornography are likely to be deterred by the prospect of
strict sentences because they often are otherwise law-abiding people of good
character and employment without prior convictions:
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para.

child pornography” (2010) 84 A.L.J. 384, at p. 390.
Courts must follow Parliament’s
direction by placing children and the wrongs and harms that people who possess
child pornography inflict on them at the centre of the sentencing process.
Courts can give significant weight to the personal circumstances and mitigating
factors of people who possess child pornography, and to sentencing objectives
such as rehabilitation:
Friesen
, at paras. 91-92, 104. But it is
all too easy for those considerations, which focus on the people being
sentenced, to overshadow the wrongs and harms they inflict because their
victims are all too often invisible. The police struggle to identify the
producers of these images and the children they victimize because the producers
abuse and exploit those children in private homes or in countries oceans
away:
J.S.
, at para. 104;
HM Advocate v. Graham
, [2010]
HCJAC 50, 2011 J.C. 1, at para. 45. Courts must overcome this invisibility by
making child victims the central focus:
Friesen
, at paras. 53, 67,
74-75; see also
Bertrand-Marchand
, at para. 32. That is why courts
can neither prioritize other objectives to the same degree as or higher than
denunciation and deterrence, nor use the personal circumstances and mitigating
factors of people who possess child pornography to avoid grappling with the
wrongs and harms they cause:

Sentencing range and guiding
principles for possessing or accessing CSAM
[
33
]
Sentencing ranges or starting points for certain types of
offences can assist sentencing judges in their application of all relevant
principles and objectives, including parity and proportionality. It is
important to note that such ranges or starting points are guidelines and not
hard and fast rules. As the Supreme Court explained, there will be
circumstances where a departure from the range, either above or below, is
entirely appropriate. [See

[

]
To reflect the “staggering and systemic nature” of the wrongs and
harms that people who possess child sexual abuse material can cause in cases
involving numerous victims, Chief Justice Tulloch found that the upper end of
the range should be raised to 5 years. The Chief Justice declined to define a
lower end for the possession of child sexual abuse material given that
possession can be committed in a wide variety of circumstances, including cases
that are prosecuted by summary conviction. [See
Pike
,
at para.
176]
[
35
]
My review of the caselaw helpfully presented by counsel and the
governing cases decided by our higher courts reveals the following:
(1)
The decisions in
Pike
and
Friesen
should act as
clarion calls to sentencing judges that sentences involving child victims,
particularly child victims of sexual violations, must increase to reflect the
real and lasting harm to children caused by these offences.
(2)
Courts should situate cases on the sentencing range by assessing
the aggravating and mitigating factors. The most useful precedents are post-
Friesen
and post-2015 legislative change cases. [See
Pike
, at para.
178]
(3)
There is a significant range of sentences, which reflects the
large variances in circumstances of both offences and offenders from case to
case.
(4)
Sentencing judges generally impose periods of custody for
possession or access offences.
(5)
Conditional sentences remain an option for sentences under 2
years; however, as Chief Justice Tulloch explained, sentences for possession of
child sexual abuse material ordinarily result in custodial sentences:
This brings me to the
appropriateness of conditional sentences for possession. First, judges should
situate cases on the range and determine whether an under two-year sentence is
appropriate before deciding whether it should be served in the community. They
must also determine that a community sentence would not endanger community safety:
McCaw
,
at paras. 20-26. Second, even if these conditions are met, courts must decide
whether a conditional sentence is consistent with the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing, especially the fundamental principle,
proportionality. This test requires considering not only personal circumstances
and mitigating factors of people who possess child pornography, but also the
severe wrongs and harms that they cause, their moral blameworthiness, and
Parliament’s prioritization of deterrence and denunciation:
McCaw
,
at paras. 27-29;
R. v. M.M.
,
2022 ONCA 441
at paras.
15-16
. As this
court held in
M.M.
, applying this second step ordinarily results in
custodial sentences because Parliament has prioritized denouncing and deterring
the wrongs and harms that people who possess child pornography cause real
children: at paras. 15-16.
…
…[W]hile
there is no presumption against conditional sentences, these post-
Proulx
changes
require more compelling personal circumstances, mitigating factors, and/or the
absence of aggravating factors, to justify a conditional sentence than might
have been the case when
Proulx
was decided more than two
decades ago.
[See
Pike
, at para.
179
& 181]
Rehabilitation
[
36
]
Prioritizing denunciation and deterrence does not mean that
rehabilitation can be ignored, or that proportionality in sentencing can be
disregarded. Sentencing is a highly individualized process, requiring
consideration of factors such as blameworthiness and prospects for
rehabilitation. This is especially true for offenders like Mr. Done, who have
no criminal record.
[
37
]
When assessing the appropriate sentence, and considering Mr.
Done’s prospects for rehabilitation, I must take into account the evidence of
doctors Cantor and Gojer, as well as the insight Mr. Done has gained over the
last few years of counselling.
Restraint Principle
[
38
]
Sections 718.2
(d) and (e) of the
Criminal
Code
require me to consider the principle of restraint when sentencing Mr. Done.
[
39
]
The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasized the critical role
that the restraint principle plays when sentencing a first-time offender. In
applying the restraint principle, sentencing judges “should seek the least
intrusive sentence and the least quantum which will achieve the overall purpose
of being an appropriate and just sanction”. While the objectives of
denunciation and deterrence must be given adequate weight, they should rarely
be the sole determinants of the length of a first jail sentence. [See

AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS
[
40
]
In determining an appropriate sentence, it is necessary to
consider any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances.
Aggravating Factors
[
41
]
I will start with the aggravating factors:
(1)
Mr. Done was a sophisticated and persistent
consumer of child sexual abuse material who maintained a collection of videos
and links to videos which he categorized according to “good”, “meh”, “not that
good”.  When his phone was examined, most of the links were no longer active
and he had deleted or “nuked” his collection, and according to Mr. Done, he had
done this “so many times”.
(2)
The analysis of his phone located over 800
images of child sexual abuse material that Mr. Done had accessed, which is a
“very large quantity”. [See
R. v. Brown
,
2022 ONCA 516
at para.
14
;
R.
v. Parker
,
2024 ONCA 591
]
(3)
The very young age of the victims is very
aggravating.
(4)
The number of different children victimized in
the images/videos accessed by Mr. Done is aggravating.
(5)
The degrading nature of the acts committed in
those videos is highly aggravating.
(6)
Mr. Done shared and offered to trade child
sexual abuse material with others.
(7)
He counselled others, including a user who
identified as a 13-year-old girl, how to engage with child sexual abuse
material on the Internet and how to avoid detection.
(8)
Mr. Done encouragingly listened and actively
engaged with other users of child sexual abuse material and consumed their tales
of child sexual abuse. Indeed, Mr. Done made supportive and disturbing comments
like “What I wouldn’t give to be asked to babysit.”
(9)
The long-term, devastating impact on the
children whose images Mr. Done consumed is an aggravating factor.
Mitigating Factors
[
42
]
I now turn to the mitigating factors, which
include:
(1)
Mr. Done has a strong and supportive community
of people, including his wife and family, to help him with his rehabilitation.
(2)
He has taken concrete steps towards his own
rehabilitation, including having engaged in counselling since his arrest.
(3)
Mr. Done has gained some insight into the real
harm to children that flows from his offending behaviour and has expressed some
remorse for his actions.
(4)
I take into account the many good qualities his
wife and family have highlighted in their reference letters. Of course, I am
mindful that Mr. Done managed to commit the offence while keeping his wife and
family completely in the dark about his interest in and consumption of child
sexual abuse material.
(5)
I appreciate that Mr. Done lost his employment
as a teacher and likely won’t be able to teach again. I have taken into account
this collateral consequence, although I note that the loss of his job flows mainly
from the offence itself, not from the sentence I will impose. Realistically, a
teacher cannot be employed if he has accessed child sexual abuse material and has
been diagnosed with pedophilia.
(6)
I have considered that Mr Done has been on bail facing
these charges for several years. I appreciate that significant delay was
accrued due to legitimate, post-trial applications brought by Mr. Done. I also note
that Mr. Bytensky explicitly expressed that he was not seeking
Downes
credit for Mr. Done.
(7)
Finally, I find that a reduction of the sentence
I will impose is necessary to reflect the breach of Mr. Done’s rights under sections
10(a) and (b) of the
Charter
, which included informational deficiencies
and the police failure to hold off, which came reasonably close to leading to
exclusion of the evidence.  [See
R. v. Nasogaluak

;

Scott
,
2023 ONSC 3023
; and my Reasons for Decision on
Charter
Application,

APPROPRIATE SENTENCE
[
43
]
Sean Done was a sophisticated
consumer of child sexual abuse material. He accessed this material regularly
and kept a collection of preferred videos and links in his notes on his phone. He
had accessed over 800 images/videos of the degrading and dehumanizing sexual
abuse of many, very young children.  The Court of Appeal described 500 files as
a “very large quantity warranting a significant sentence” in upholding a 3-year
penitentiary sentence. [
See
Brown
, at para.
14]
[
44
]
While there are cases with larger
numbers of images/videos, Mr. Done’s moral blameworthiness is high. In addition
to accessing the images of child sexual abuse, of very young children doing extraordinarily
invasive sexual acts, Mr. Done shared and traded such images with others. And
he counselled others how to access child sexual abuse material in a way to
minimize the chance of detection.
[
45
]
I also find that the historical
approach to counting images and videos in a user’s possession is becoming a
less and less effective way of determining levels of culpability. Experienced consumers
of child sexual abuse material such as Mr. Done are now accessing images and videos
through links that give them access without requiring them to download and
possess those images and videos.
[
46
]
Without the consumer, there would
be no market for the recording of child sexual abuse material. As a sentencing
judge, I must denounce such abhorrent conduct and send the message to Mr. Done
and other like-minded individuals that there will be serious consequences to
making the choice to access or possess images of child sexual abuse.
[
47
]
Those images and videos of child
sexual abuse material that consumers like Mr. Done access for their
gratification are actually documentaries capturing the devastation of
children’s lives. Consuming this abusive material fans the flames lit by the CSAM
arsonists who continue to sexually abuse children, often their own children, and
create new content for users like Mr. Done.
[
48
]
When I consider the aggravating and
mitigating factors and apply the relevant sentencing principles, I find it
necessary and appropriate to impose a denunciatory sentence of 26 months. However,
I have also concluded that I must deduct four months from Mr. Done’s sentence,
per
Nasogaluac
, bringing the total remaining sentence to 22 months.
[
49
]
I am mindful that a sentence of 22 months falls into the range
where a conditional sentence order is permitted; however, pursuant to
R.
v. Fice,
2005 SCC 32
, since the
sentence I would have imposed, but for the deduction is more than two
years, a conditional sentence is not available.
[
50
]
Even if my application of
Fice
is wrong, and a conditional
sentence is still available, I would not impose one in this case. In my
view, given the facts and circumstances of the offence for which Mr. Done was
found guilty, a conditional sentence would be manifestly inadequate to address
the relevant sentencing principles. A conditional sentence, or a sentence in
the alternative range proposed by Mr. Bytensky, would not reflect the gravity
of the offence and the degree of responsibility of Mr. Done. [See
R. v.
Shaporov

79-80
;
Brown
, at para.

;
Pike
,

182]
[
51
]
In addition to the jail sentence, I find that a period of probation
of two years is necessary to assist in Mr. Done’s re-integration into the
community after serving his jail sentence. This is designed to provide
assistance to Mr. Done with his rehabilitation, as well as to provide a measure
of community supervision.  Rather than impose a s. 161 order, I will integrate
similar terms into the probation order.
SENTENCE IMPOSED
[
52
]
Mr. Done, please stand. I am sentencing you to serve 22 months in
a provincial institution.
[
53
]
In addition, at the conclusion of your sentence, I am placing you
on 2 years of probation with the following terms:
Terms of Probation:
(1)
You must keep the peace and be of good
behaviour.
(2)
You must appear before the court when required
to do so by the court.
(3)
You must notify the court or the probation
officer in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the
court or the probation officer of any change in employment or occupation.
(4)
Reporting
: Within
two business days after your release from custody, you must report to a
probation officer in person and thereafter as directed by your probation
officer or their designate, at all times and places as directed.
(5)
Counselling
: You
must attend and actively participate in all assessments, counselling or rehabilitative
programs as directed and complete them to the satisfaction of your probation
officer. I am ordering that a copy of the letter from Dr. Cantor and the
reports of Dr. Gojer and Daniel Kehoe be provided to probation.
(6)
Sign Releases:
You shall sign any release of information forms as will enable your probation
officer to monitor your attendance and completion of any assessments,
counselling, or rehabilitative programs.
(7)
Restrictions on use of the Internet
: You must not use any desktop or laptop computer, tablet or mobile
device for the purpose of viewing photographs or videos of persons under the
age of 18, unless you are in the direct and continuous presence of your wife, Ada
Carolina Cermeno Velasquez. You must also not access any Internet forum or chat
group unless in the direct and continuous presence of Ada Carolina Cermeno
Velasquez.
ANCILLARY ORDERS
[
54
]
In addition, I am making the following ancillary orders:
(1)
DNA Order
Section 163.1(4.1) is a primary designated offence for which I
must make an order pursuant to
s. 487.051(1)
of the
Criminal Code
. I therefore order
that you provide samples of bodily substances reasonably required for the
purpose of forensic DNA analysis to be used in accordance with the DNA
Identification Act.
(2)
SOIRA Order
Pursuant to
sections 490.012(3)
of the
Criminal Code
, I
order that you comply with the terms of the Sex Offender
Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years.
Given Mr. Done’s diagnosis of pedophilia, the pro-CSAM
statements he made in the chats located on his phone, the nature of the videos
accessed by Mr. Done and the public interest in preventing and investigating
crimes of a sexual nature, including CSAM offences, I find that Mr. Done has
failed to demonstrate that the impact on him would be grossly disproportionate
to the public interest. [See
R. v. Eldon
,
2025 ONCA 348
at paras.
63-70]
I note that 20 years is the mandatory minimum duration [see s. 490.013(2)(b)],
and that Mr. Done can apply after 10 years to terminate the order. [See s.
490.15(1)(b); and
Eldon
, at para.
72]
(3)
Order of Forfeiture and Return
Pursuant to
s. 164.2(1)
of the
Criminal Code
,
I am ordering that the cellphone used to access child sexual abuse material be
forfeited to His Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General
directs.
The remaining devices that were seized by
police and remain in their possession shall be returned to Mr. Done.
(4)
VSF
Finally, considering that I am sentencing Mr. Done to a lengthy
period of custody, I am waiving the VFS.
[
55
]
Mr. Done, you have committed a grave offence for which you must
serve your time in custody. To your credit, you have already taken steps to
gain insight into the harmfulness of your actions. You are fortunate that you
have a loving and supportive family to help you in your rehabilitation. When
you are released from custody, I hope you will take advantage of that support, and
the assistance of probation, to help you continue your rehabilitative journey.
[
56
]
I wish you well.
Released:  June 5, 2025
