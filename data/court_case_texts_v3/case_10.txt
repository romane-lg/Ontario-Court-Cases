ROBICHAUD J.:
I.
Introduction
[
1
]
For the reasons that follow, I find Mr. G. not guilty of the
offences charged.
[
2
]
While the burden of proof rests with the Crown to establish guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt, this case presents an evidentiary record that not
only fails to meet that standard but, in important respects, points in the
opposite direction.
[
3
]
On the evidence before me, I am persuaded that
the allegations cannot be true.
[
4
]
I reject the complainant’s evidence on the core allegations in
its entirety. When the totality of the evidence is assessed, it is virtually
impossible that the events she described occurred.
[
5
]
The Court of Appeal in
R. v. Mullins‑Johnson
,
2007 ONCA 720
, confirmed that a criminal trial is not a forum for declarations
of factual innocence. At paragraph 23, the Court adopted the observation of
The
Lamer Commission of Inquiry Pertaining to the Cases of:  Ronald Dalton, Gregory
Parsons, Randy Druken,
that the function of a criminal trial is:
[T]o determine whether the
Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  If so, the accused is
guilty.  If not, the accused is found not guilty.  There is no finding of
factual innocence since it would not fall within the ambit or purpose of
criminal law.
[
6
]
However, this principle does not preclude a trial judge from
making clear findings about the reliability and truthfulness of the evidence.
Where the record demonstrates that allegations are unsupported, unreliable, or
false, it is the Court’s duty to say so. The fact that the criminal process
results in a binary verdict does not prevent a judge from explaining the
factual basis for that result.
[
7
]
In my view, it would be an abdication of the Court’s judicial
responsibility, and intellectually dishonest, to temper or obscure necessary
factual findings merely because they may extend beyond the narrow legal
distinction between guilt and not guilty. Just as a conviction may rest on overwhelming
evidence of culpability, an acquittal may rest on overwhelming evidence that
points away from culpability.
[
8
]
In circumstances such as these, where the
criminal trial may be the only forum in which the allegations are subjected to
rigorous scrutiny, the Court must state its factual conclusions plainly and
without qualification.
II.
Legal Issues
A.
The burden and standard of proof.
[
9
]
The accused is presumed innocent on each count
unless and until the Crown proves the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
[i]
This presumption of innocence is guaranteed by
section 11(d)
of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. The burden of proof never
shifts and remains with the Crown.
[
10
]
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably
linked to the presumption of innocence. The law does not lightly brand someone
a criminal. A reasonable doubt is one based on reason and common sense, and is
logically derived from the evidence or the absence of evidence. A reasonable
doubt is not an imaginary or frivolous doubt and is not based on sympathy or
prejudice.
[ii]
[
11
]
Likely or probable guilt is insufficient to meet
the criminal standard, but proof to an absolute certainty is not required.
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt lies much closer to absolute certainty than to
proof on a balance of probabilities.
[
12
]
The accused bears no burden to prove any fact or
to call evidence supporting an inference of innocence or a finding of
reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt may arise from the evidence or from a lack
of evidence.
[iii]
[
13
]
The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
applies to the final determination of guilt or innocence based on the totality
of the evidence. It is not applied piecemeal to individual items or categories
of evidence.
[iv]
B.
Principles governing child
witness evidence (
W.(R.)
,
A.M.
,
D.D.
).
[
14
]
This case rests entirely on the evidence of
M.R., who was 12 years old at the time of the alleged events and remains a
young person today. Her evidence forms the sole foundation of the Crown’s case.
It is therefore essential to approach her testimony in accordance with the
principles that govern the assessment of child witnesses.
[
15
]
It is well established that the evidence of
child witnesses must be approached in a common-sense manner, considering the
age of the witness and the fact that children experience the world differently
than adults. Although children may not be able to recount precise details such
as the when and where of an event with exactitude, “this does not mean that
they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it.”:
R. v. B.(G.),
1990 CanLII 7308 (SCC)
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at p. 55.
[
16
]
In
R. v. W.(R.),
1992 CanLII 56 (SCC)
, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122 at
paragraph
26
, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized that credibility
assessments must reflect the mental development, understanding, and
communicative abilities of the individual witness. The Court cautioned against
rigid distinctions between “adult” and “child” standards. Instead, every
witness must be evaluated as an individual. The Supreme Court further observed
that when a person testifies about events that occurred during childhood,
inconsistencies on peripheral matters, particularly relating to timing or location,
must be considered in light of the witness’s age at the time of the events.
[
17
]
The Court of Appeal has reaffirmed these
principles. In
R. v. A.M
.
,
2014 ONCA 769
at paragraph
9
, the
Court stated that “[f]irst, every witness, irrespective of age, is an individual
whose credibility and evidence should be assessed according to criteria
appropriate to his or her mental development, understanding and ability to
communicate,” citing
W.(R.)
.
More recently, in
R. v. D.D
.
,
2022 ONCA 786
at paragraph
4
, the Court reiterated that a child’s evidence must
be approached on a common
‑
sense basis that reflects the way children experience and recall
events.
[
18
]
Most importantly, the evidence of children is
not to be treated as evidence that is inherently unreliable or to be treated
with special caution.
R. v. W.R., supra,
at para 142-143.
[
19
]
Children may not attend to details that adults
consider important. Omissions or inaccuracies relating to peripheral matters
such as spatial orientation or the precise passage of time are neither
surprising nor, in themselves, indicative of unreliability. As W.(R.)
illustrates at paragraph
30
, a child’s inability to describe the layout of
bedrooms in a house was not significant to the assessment of reliability
because it related to a peripheral matter.
[
20
]
These authorities guide my approach to the
evidence in this case. I have assessed M.R.’s account in a manner that takes
full and careful account of her age, developmental stage, and ability to
communicate, without imposing adult expectations on peripheral aspects of her
recollection. At the same time, I must determine whether the core elements of
her account are reliable when considered in the context of the entire
evidentiary record.
III.
An Overview of the Evidence
A.
The evidence of the complainant, M.R.
[
21
]
M.R. was 12 years old at the time of the alleged
incident. Her evidence was presented through her testimony and through a video
‑
recorded statement given to police on October 3, 2024, at SVU Room
1, beginning at 13:18 and ending at 14:35. The interview was conducted by
Detective Constable Leslie McNaughton. The recording was admitted on consent
under
s. 715.1
of the
Criminal Code
, and during her testimony M.R.
confirmed that she reviewed the statement shortly before trial and adopted its
contents as accurate.
[
22
]
M.R. began Grade 7 at DLMS in September 2024. She testified that
she felt nervous at the new school and particularly anxious before physical
‑
education class. She
said that before the school year began, neighbourhood peers told her that R.G.
“touches boys and girls.” She testified that because of these comments, she was
uncomfortable around him and feared he “might do something wrong.” and that her
“heart would start bumping the night before”.
[
23
]
Regarding October 1, 2024, M.R. testified that
her bus arrived at approximately 8:15 a.m. She said that upon entering the
front area of DLMS, her homeroom teacher, Ms. R., instructed her to walk around
the school and use the Grade 7 entrance at the rear. She testified that
although other late students entered through the main doors, she followed what
she understood to be Ms. R.’s instruction.
[
24
]
M.R. testified that she walked alone to the rear
of DLMS. She stated that no other students were present and that she was “the
last one” to arrive. She said she opened the external door and placed “one
foot” inside the building when she saw R.G. standing in the vestibule.
[
25
]
M.R. stated that R.G. told her to “pause,” but she continued
walking because she was frightened and “felt he might do something wrong.” She
described the entrance area as a two‑door vestibule: an exterior set of
doors and an inner set of doors leading into the hallway. She testified that
the inner door was closed at the time.
[
26
]
M.R. alleged that R.G. attempted to hug her and then placed the
palms of his hands on her chest, pressing or “squeezing” her chest “really
hard.” During the 715.1 interview, she demonstrated several different hand
positions. Her gestures in explaining how he touched her were confusing enough
that D.C. McNaughton left the room to retrieve a doll to assist her in
demonstrating.
[
27
]
M.R. stated repeatedly that the contact lasted
“two minutes” and that she “screamed [her] lungs out,” “as loud as [she]
could,” “super, super loud,” for the entire duration. These statements were
made clearly and emphatically at the beginning of the interview. When asked to
clarify the type of scream, she described a loud, full
‑
volume
scream consistent with “a horror
‑
movie scream.”:
[
28
]
When D.C. McNaughton questioned how two minutes
of such screaming could go unheard in a school with nearby classrooms, M.R.
began adjusting her estimate, at times stating it could have been “one minute,”
“maybe a minute,” or that she “forgot.” Nevertheless, she consistently
maintained that she screamed loudly and that nobody responded.
[
29
]
When asked why no one came, M.R. stated at
different points that:
•
the inner vestibule door was closed.
[
30
]
teachers “might have been teaching”.
[
31
]
students “maybe ignored it”.
•
she did not know why no one reacted.
At other points she agreed that, in
general, such a scream would be heard.
[
32
]
She testified that when the alleged contact ended, R.G. closed
the exterior door, walked inside toward the gym area, and said, “I’m gay” and
that he “can’t wait to see you first period tomorrow.” M.R. said she then
continued into the school but did not disclose the incident immediately.
[1]
[
33
]
Later that morning, during a period she described as “free time,”
M.R. emailed her parents about the incident. She testified that they instructed
her to write down what happened “on the back of [her] book,” and she did so.
[2]
[
34
]
M.R. also stated, both in her video statement
and in her testimony, that she had either witnessed or heard of other
inappropriate conduct by R.G., including touching a girl on the lips during gym
and pushing another student on the back. She could not provide names for any of
the students involved, and her account varied as to whether she observed these
incidents or learned of them from classmates.
[
35
]
When asked to identify the students involved in
these prior alleged incidents, M.R. said she did not know their names. She
stated that the girls were “from another class,” that she “forgot their names,”
and that they were no longer at DLMS. At various points she said: “I don’t
remember her name,” “I forgot,” “she’s gone,” “I think she left the school,”
and “we wouldn’t be able to find them now.”
[
36
]
During cross
‑
examination,
M.R. confirmed that she heard negative information about R.G. from
neighbourhood peers before starting at DLMS and that she was already afraid of
gym class prior to October 1. She insisted that Ms. R. had directed her to the
rear entrance and that R.G. was supervising that doorway, despite evidence to
the contrary. She acknowledged that several classrooms were close to the
vestibule but maintained that no one would have heard her screaming because the
inner door was closed.
B.
The evidence of the principal, “Mr. H.”
[
37
]
Mr. H. testified that he became the principal of
DLMS in March 2024, having previously served in a centrally assigned
administrative role. He had no prior dealings with M.R. before the events in
question. He described the school’s physical layout, morning supervision
structure, entry procedures, and general operational routines in September and
October of the 2024–2025 academic year.
[
38
]
Mr. H. explained that classes at DLMS begin at
8:10 a.m., and that morning supervision runs from 7:55 a.m. to 8:10 a.m.
Students may enter through any of five entrances during that period. Although
certain doors tend to be used by certain grade groups. For example, the Grade 7
doors located on the north side of the building and there is a general “free
‑
flow” entry pattern in the morning. When the 8:10 bell rings,
supervising staff and students are expected to move toward their classrooms for
the start of the instructional day.
[
39
]
He testified that Door 6, the entryway closest
to the Grade 7 hallway, consists of an exterior set of double doors and an
interior set of double doors forming a vestibule. He explained that this
vestibule is not soundproof. In his experience, a normal
‑
volume conversation occurring inside the vestibule might not be
heard from inside nearby classrooms, but shouting or screaming would be heard
clearly, and he would expect staff to respond. Under examination, he created a
layout of the entrances to the school. This was entered as Exhibit 3.
[
40
]
Mr. H. addressed teacher supervision schedules.
He testified that the supervision timetable for October 2024 was in place at
the start of the school year and had not been amended on October 1. This was as
filed as exhibit to the proceedings.
[
41
]
According to this schedule:
(1)
Ms. R. did not have morning supervision duties
during the 2024–2025 school year. Her assigned supervision was at lunch, in an
outdoor field area.
(2)
The Accused, R.G. also had no morning
supervision assignments. His duties were scheduled after school, largely
connected with dismissal.
(3)
October 1, 2024, was a “Day 9” in DLMS’s ten
‑
day cycle, during which R.G. was scheduled for “planning time”
during first period (8:10–9:10 a.m.).
[
42
]
He explained that “Planning time” or “PT” is
self
‑
directed, but teachers are expected to be engaged in professional
work; it does not include supervision duties, nor would teachers be posted at
an entry door without an assigned duty.
[
43
]
Mr. H. testified that in his experience,
teachers who do not have assigned entry
‑
door
duties do not “loiter” at the doors after supervision ends. He also testified
that when buses arrive late, affected students are expected to enter through
the front doors, not by circulating around the exterior of the school building
to a secondary entrance.
[
44
]
He explained that exterior doors at DLMS are
manually locked by the custodian shortly after 8:10 a.m. Although it is
theoretically possible for a particular door to remain unlocked for a short
period depending on the custodian’s sequence, he testified that the routine
practice is to secure the building promptly so that all students enter through
monitored access points.
[
45
]
After learning that police were investigating an
allegation involving a student, Mr. H. testified that he reviewed supervision
records and spoke with staff. He determined that no supervision
‑
duty switches had occurred on October 1, 2024. According to him, Ms.
R. confirmed that she had not been supervising the front entrance that morning
and had not directed any late students to use the rear Grade 7 doors. Despite
the hearsay nature of this statement, the Court was able to hear from Ms. R.
and her evidence is addressed below.
[
46
]
Mr. H. further testified that DLMS does not have
CCTV coverage at the Grade 7 doors. The only exterior
‑
facing
camera is part of a front
‑
lobby buzzer system with a short digital buffer. By the time he
attempted to check it, the data from October 1, 2024, had already been
overwritten, making it impossible to retrieve any footage relevant to the
events in question.
C.
The evidence of teacher “Ms. R.”
[
47
]
Ms. R. testified that she is a Grade 7 teacher
at DLMS, where she has taught since 2018. During the 2024–2025 school year, she
was M.R.’s homeroom teacher and taught her several subjects, including
language, history, geography, visual arts, and music. She confirmed that M.R.
was new to DLMS in September 2024.
[
48
]
Ms. R. described the location of her classroom,
Room 111, near the Grade 7 entrance referred to as Door 6, which consists of a
set of exterior double doors leading into a vestibule, followed by an interior
set of double doors that lead directly into the Grade 7 hallway.
[
49
]
She testified that she had no morning
supervision duties during the 2024–2025 school year. Her assigned supervision
was at lunchtime, in an outdoor area used by Grade 6 students. She explained
that morning supervision at DLMS ends at 8:10 a.m., after which teachers are
expected to be moving into their classrooms to prepare for the start of the
instructional day.
[
50
]
Ms. R. testified that she was not supervising
any doors on the morning of October 1, 2024, and that she would not have been
standing at the front entrance at approximately 8:15 a.m. She stated that she
did not recall seeing M.R. arrive late that morning and did not remember any
unusual behaviour from her at the start of the day.
[
51
]
Ms. R. also testified about the established
procedure for late
‑
arriving students. When a school bus arrives after the 8:10 a.m.
bell, late students are expected to enter through the main front doors and
report directly to their homeroom class. She stated clearly that she would
never instruct a late student to walk outside around the building to use the
rear Grade 7 entrance. She said she has never done so during her years of
teaching at DLMS.
[
52
]
In particular, Ms. R. testified that she did not
direct M.R. to use the rear entrance on October 1, 2024. She stated that she was
in her classroom, as expected, at or around 8:20 a.m. and had no recollection
of any interaction with M.R. at the doors that morning.
[
53
]
She testified about the audibility of sounds
from the vestibule at Door 6. This is a door close to her classroom that she is
familiar with.
[
54
]
She confirmed that the vestibule doors are not
soundproof. In her experience, she stated that she can hear normal
‑
volume conversations coming from the vestibule, depending on where
she is located inside her classroom. She testified that she would certainly
hear shouting or screaming, even with both sets of doors closed. She stated
that if she ever heard a student screaming loudly, she would “absolutely check”
to determine what was happening and would expect other staff to react similarly.
She testified that she did not hear any screaming on the morning of October 1,
2024.
[
55
]
Ms. R. further described the typical noise level
and routines between 8:10 and 8:20 a.m. After the 8:10 bell, she testified that
O Canada is played over the school’s PA system, followed by morning
announcements lasting approximately five to ten minutes. She explained that
students are expected to remain still during this period and that hallways and
classrooms are generally quiet. She testified that she is normally in her
classroom preparing for instruction during this interval.
[
56
]
On cross
‑
examination,
Ms. R. acknowledged that on rare occasions teachers may switch supervision
duties if a supply teacher is present, but such switches are not informal and
are ordinarily communicated to administration. She confirmed that she did not
switch duties on October 1, 2024 and had no reason to be supervising at either
the front or rear entrance at that time.
[
57
]
She also testified that she did not recall any
conversation with Mr. H. pertaining to M.R.’s alleged late arrival or any
behaviours observed that morning. She explained that although she may not
recall every conversation from over a year ago, she had no memory of speaking
with administration about the incident at the time.
IV.
Analysis of the Complainant’s Evidence
A.
Core vs. peripheral inconsistencies
[
58
]
I have assessed M.R.’s evidence with appropriate sensitivity to
her age, while distinguishing core elements of her account from peripheral
details. Peripheral matters include minor aspects of orientation, the precise
number of steps into the vestibule, and small variations in time references.
The core elements concern: (i) whether Ms. R. directed M.R. to the rear Grade 7
doors; (ii) whether R.G. was present at Door 6 supervising that entry; (iii)
the nature of the physical contact M.R. described; (iv) the duration and
intensity of her screaming; and (v) the absence of any response from teachers
or students in nearby classrooms.
[
59
]
On the core elements, M.R.’s account is
internally inconsistent and is contradicted by reliable independent evidence.
She maintained that Ms. R. directed her to walk outside around the building to
the rear doors. Ms. R. testified that she had no morning supervision, that late
students are to enter through the front doors, that she would never direct a
late student to walk around to the rear doors, and that she did not so direct
M.R. on October 1, 2024. Mr. H. corroborated the morning routine and the
absence of any duty for Ms. R. at the front doors that morning.
[
60
]
M.R. also stated that R.G. was supervising Door
6 when she arrived. Mr. H. testified that R.G. had no morning supervision
assignment and was scheduled for planning time during Period 1 on the relevant
day. There was no evidence of any duty switch and no independent evidence
placing R.G. on supervision at Door 6 at the relevant time.
[
61
]
As to the physical contact, M.R. gave multiple,
mutually inconsistent demonstrations of hand position during her video
‑
recorded interview. She ultimately described crossed arms and palms pressed
against her chest, with a “push” or “squeeze.” The repeated need for a doll to
clarify basic hand positioning, combined with the difficulty of reconciling
crossed arms with a sustained “squeeze” of the chest, leaves the mechanics of
the alleged contact uncertain.
[
62
]
The gesture demonstrations in the 715.1 video
posed significant difficulty. M.R. alternated between depictions of open arms,
crossed arms, and palms pressed against her chest. Even with the use of a doll,
her explanations did not settle into a plausible description that could be
reconciled with a sustained “squeeze.” This instability in the mechanics of the
alleged contact fundamentally undermines any confidence in relying on her
description.
[
63
]
The duration and absence of response is also a core
issue. M.R. initially and repeatedly asserted a two
‑
minute
contact accompanied by screaming “as loud as [she] could,” “super, super loud,”
and “screamed [her] lungs out,” consistent with a full
‑
volume
“horror
‑
movie” scream. She later adjusted the duration to one minute, maybe
a minute, or stated that she forgot, but consistently maintained that she
screamed at full volume, and no one responded.
[
64
]
Mr. H. and Ms. R. testified that the vestibule
is not soundproof, that nearby classrooms (including M.R.’s homeroom) are at
most a few feet from the interior doors, and that a loud scream at that
location and time would be heard and would prompt immediate investigation.
[
65
]
These inconsistencies implicate core features of
the allegation and cannot be explained by peripheral imprecision alone. They
materially undermine the reliability of M.R.’s account and her credibility on
the complaint alleged.
B.
The compounded improbabilities
[
66
]
The Crown’s theory requires acceptance of several propositions
that are each unlikely on the evidence. When multiple improbabilities must be
accepted together, their combined effect reduces, rather than enhances, the
plausibility of the overall account. A narrative that depends on several
independent unlikely contingencies becomes progressively less plausible with
each contingency that must be accepted.
[
67
]
Here, the theory relies on the complainant’s
evidence and therefore requires that:
(1)
Ms. R. was present at, and directing students
at, the front entrance after 8:10 a.m., despite having no morning duty and her
clear evidence that she was in her classroom
(2)
R.G. was simultaneously at Door 6, also with no
assigned duty, contrary to the supervision schedule and Mr. H.’s testimony.
(3)
Exterior doors that are ordinarily locked
shortly after 8:10 a.m. were sufficiently unsecured to permit M.R. to enter
from the rear at around 8:20.
(4)
The late
‑
bus
procedure was departed from. Such that M.R., a single late
‑
arriving student, was directed to the rear doors rather than the
front entrance; and,
(5)
M.R. screamed at full volume for one to two (or
one) minute(s) and no one in nearby classrooms responded.
[
68
]
While none of these individual propositions is
impossible, each is implausible. The Crown’s theory requires that all of them
be true at the same time. Even considered separately, each factor is capable of
raising doubt; when assessed cumulatively, they form a chain of improbabilities
that leads me to conclude that the central allegations are not only unproven,
but categorically false.

C.
Interview
‑
based
contamination (influence of officer’s disbelief, suggestion, breaks, etc.)
[
69
]
The interview must be considered in light of the challenging task
faced by Detective Constable McNaughton. She began with an approach that
encouraged a free and untainted account. Her initial questions were open ended.
She reminded the complainant that it was acceptable not to know an answer. She
emphasized that the purpose was to understand what happened and that the
complainant should correct any inaccuracies. These early features of the interview
reflected a conscientious and child‑appropriate effort to elicit reliable
evidence.
[
70
]
As the interview progressed, the officer encountered elements of
the account that were difficult to reconcile with ordinary experience,
particularly the allegation of prolonged full‑volume screaming without
any response. Faced with an apparent inconsistency of that magnitude, she
attempted to clarify the evidence and to understand how such a scenario could
have occurred. The tension between supporting a young complainant and ensuring
that the account was coherent and reliable created an understandably difficult
interviewing environment. Her expressions of confusion and her requests for
clarification arose from this tension rather than from any improper motive.
[
71
]
Despite the officer’s good‑faith
intentions, the manner of clarification sometimes took the form of direct
challenges to the plausibility of the narrative, suggestions of alternative
explanations, and invitations to ‘start fresh.’ In the context of a child
witness, such techniques risk signaling preferred answers.
[
72
]
The complainant’s subsequent shifts in duration, explanations for
the absence of a response, and adjustments to the configuration of the
vestibule illustrate how a young witness may become responsive to perceived
expectations. This influence can occur even when an officer is acting
conscientiously.
[
73
]
The resulting effect is that aspects of the narrative became
intertwined with the dynamics of the interview itself. This is not a finding of
fault. It reflects the inherent complexity of interviewing a young complainant
about a distressing allegation in circumstances where parts of the account
appear improbable. The officer was attempting to carry out a difficult task
responsibly. At the same time, the interview conditions contributed to changes
in the complainant’s evidence that require the court to approach those portions
of the statement with caution, especially as it relates to her deviation from
‘two minutes’ to ‘one minute,’ the former being far less plausible on the
evidence.
D.
Demeanour
Evidence
[
74
]
Defence counsel submitted that the complainant’s demeanour while
testifying, including moments of lightness or giggling, undermined her
credibility. Respectfully, I do not accept that submission. Her demeanour
appeared unremarkable for a young witness testifying in unfamiliar and
stressful circumstances. I did not observe conduct that suggested evasiveness,
fabrication, or an intention to mislead.
[
75
]
While a court may properly consider testimonial
demeanour in assessing a witness’s credibility, binding authority has
repeatedly cautioned against placing significant weight on demeanour. The Court
of Appeal of Ontario has emphasized that demeanour is an inherently unreliable
indicator of truthfulness and must therefore be treated with considerable
caution. Demeanour can be influenced by many factors unrelated to honesty,
including age, stress, cultural background, anxiety, and the artificial nature
of courtroom testimony.
[v]
[
76
]
In this case and as explained in detail above, the concerns with
the complainant’s evidence arise not from how she testified but from what she
testified. The internal inconsistencies in her account, the evolving nature of
key details, the impact of the interview dynamics, and the objective
improbabilities demonstrated by the surrounding evidence are the foundation of
my findings. Her demeanour does not meaningfully advance or detract from the
analysis.
V.
Conclusion
[
77
]
Cases of this kind are difficult for every participant in the
justice system. Allegations of sexual misconduct by a teacher against a child
engage the responsibilities of police, prosecutors, defence counsel, and the
Court with particular intensity. Each plays a distinct and essential role.
Nothing in these reasons should be taken as a criticism of any individual or
institution involved in the investigation or prosecution of this matter. The
materials demonstrate that all participants acted professionally and in good
faith.
[
78
]
At the same time, the Court must decide the case on the evidence.
[
79
]
Having assessed the complainant’s testimony with the sensitivity
appropriate to a young witness, considered the interview dynamics and their
effect on the reliability of key features of the account, and weighed the
cumulative implausibilities required by the Crown’s theory, and the
contradictory
viva voce
evidence and corresponding exhibits, I am not
satisfied that the offence has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The
compounded improbabilities identified in these reasons diminish, rather than
strengthen, the plausibility of the allegations advanced.
[
80
]
It is unfortunate that Mr. G. was required to endure the stress
and consequences associated with these allegations. However, it is only in a
forum such as this, where evidence is presented, tested, and weighed with care,
that a just and proper result can be reached.
[
81
]
I therefore find the accused, Mr. G. NOT GUILTY on all offences
before the court.
A publication ban under
s. 486.4
of the
Criminal
Code
remains in effect. A copy of these reasons, removing any information
that could identify the complainant or other witnesses, shall be provided to
counsel for the accused.

The timing of disclosure has no bearing on my credibility findings of the
complainant, I mention this only for the purpose of describing the sequence of
events and how it ties into other evidence heard at trial. The timing of
disclosure of a sexual abuse claim, standing alone, has no probative value. See
R. v. D.(D.)
[2004] 2. S.C.R. 275
[2]
This letter was not tendered at trial for any purpose and
therefore I place no weight on its alleged contents or that she made the report
to her parents.
[3]
I recognize that such a conclusion is an uncommon one for a court to reach.
