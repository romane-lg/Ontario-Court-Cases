GARG J.:
Overview
[
1
]
It was the Saturday night after the Winona Peach
Festival. As expected, the neighbourhood was more lively than usual. Victor
Renzella’s home sits in a residential neighbourhood, but its backyard abuts the
parking lot of a Tim Hortons—a magnet for late-night gatherings. On this night,
a group of young men, including the accused, Nicolas Cappella, had parked there
with music blaring. For Victor Renzella, this was not a new irritation. He had
been battling noise from that parking lot for 23 years, and his frustration
boiled over when calls to turn down the music were met with vulgar defiance.
Victor and his son Lucas drove over to confront the group.
[1]
They did not find a respectful
or passive crowd. They found Mr. Cappella, beer in one hand, baseball bat in
the other, projecting a readiness for confrontation. Threats flew—“You want to
get clapped?”—and Mr. Cappella swung his bat at them. When Victor’s other son Nicholas
arrived, the confrontation erupted into a full-blown fight. It was during the
fight that Mr. Cappella struck both Victor and Lucas with the bat. Victor
suffered severe injuries to his face.
[
2
]
Several individuals could be criticized for
their conduct in the parking lot that night. But my task is not to pass
judgment on the group. My task is to decide whether the Crown has proven any of
the charges against Mr. Cappella beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
3
]
For the reasons that follow, I find that Mr.
Cappella caused the injuries to Victor Renzella. He acted unreasonably when he
struck him in the head with a baseball bat. The strike was not immunized by Mr.
Cappella’s claim that he was defending his friends. I find that Mr. Cappella
committed an aggravated assault against Victor. He did not, however, intend to
kill him. I further find that Mr. Cappella assaulted Lucas Renzella when he
swung the bat toward him. However, I do not hold him culpable for striking or injuring
him. Finally, I conclude that Mr. Cappella is not guilty of uttering threats to
harm the Renzellas, as I cannot reject the application of self-defence.
Issues
[
4
]
This case raises the following issues (with my
bottom-line conclusion in italics):
(1)
Did Mr. Cappella wound Victor Renzella?
Yes.
The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Cappella caused Victor Renzella’s
injuries. The Crown has therefore proven the causation element of the
aggravated assault offence.
(2)
Was the aggravated assault permitted by defence
of person?
No. The Crown has disproven the defence beyond a reasonable
doubt. The Crown has proven the charge of aggravated assault beyond a
reasonable doubt.
(3)
Did Mr. Cappella attempt to cause the death of Victor
Renzella?
No. The Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Cappella had the intention to kill.
(4)
Is Mr. Cappella guilty of assault with a weapon
because he struck Lucas Renzella with a baseball bat?
No. The Crown has not
proven that Mr. Cappella struck Lucas Renzella with the bat before the fight broke
out. While Mr. Cappella struck Lucas with the bat during the fight, the Crown
has not disproven self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt.
(5)
Is Mr. Cappella guilty of assault with a weapon
because he swung the baseball bat at Lucas Renzella without making contact?
Yes.
The Crown has disproven self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown has
proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
(6)
Is Mr. Cappella guilty of making death threats
to Victor Renzella or Lucas Renzella?
No. The Crown has not disproven beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Cappella uttered the threats in self-defence.
General
principles
[
5
]
The Crown bears the onus of proving each and
every element of the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Cappella
carries no onus to prove or disprove anything. He is presumed innocent of all
charges. The burden of proof never shifts to Mr. Cappella. It is not enough for
me to believe that Mr. Cappella is probably or likely guilty of an offence. In
that situation, I would need to acquit. While the Crown is not required to prove
its case to an absolute certainty, proof beyond a reasonable doubt falls much
closer to an absolute certainty than the balance of probabilities. The Crown’s burden
is onerous and unique to the criminal process. Reasonable doubt can arise from
the evidence or from the absence of evidence.
[
6
]
The various issues require me to conduct an
analysis pursuant to the principles articulated in
R. v. Villaroman
,
2016 SCC 33
. I must consider other reasonable possibilities or plausible
theories that are inconsistent with guilt to decide whether an inference of
guilt is the only reasonable inference. Inferences inconsistent with guilt do
not need to arise from proven facts, as this would put an obligation on an
accused to prove facts. Reasonable possibilities must be based on logic and
experience applied to the evidence or the absence of evidence, not on
speculation. My assessment of the circumstantial evidence and the process of
drawing inferences are guided by the Court of Appeal’s decision in
R.
v. Gibson
,
2021 ONCA 530
at paras.
75-79
.
Credibility and reliability findings
[
7
]
I heard from six witnesses who were involved in
some capacity in the encounter that night. The Crown called Victor, Lucas, and
Nicholas Renzella. The defence called three of Mr. Cappella’s friends: Hayden
Cripps, Matthew Spadaro, and Leo Kantartzis. I do not find that any witness was
deceitful in their testimony.
[2]
However, the witnesses were unreliable on the specifics of what was said or
done during the build-up and ensuing fight. No witness was a disinterested
observer. Each was aligned with a side in a fast-moving, high-tension encounter.
Heightened emotions, stress, and divided loyalties predictably impaired
perception. I rely on the video footage of the encounter as the independent
historian. Nevertheless, I can believe some, none, or all of a witness’s
testimony:
R. v. S.H.
,
2011 ONCA 215
at para.
8
. There are points where
I rely on a witness because I am satisfied that their bias and emotions did not
overwhelm their ability to provide credible and reliable testimony.
Issue #1: Did Mr. Cappella cause Victor
Renzella’s injuries?
[
8
]
There is no dispute that Mr. Cappella struck
Victor Renzella in the head with a baseball bat. There is also no dispute that
Victor Renzella suffered serious injuries to his face that would easily constitute
the wounding required to make out aggravated assault. The photographs of Victor’s
face show injuries under both eyes. There are serious injuries to his entire
right eye and right cheek. The cut to the cheek had been stitched. There is
blood in his nose and cuts to his lip. The hospital performed surgery within a
few days of the incident and put two plates in Victor’s face. The records show
that he underwent extensive procedures: repair of a zygomatic fracture
dislocation with three-point fixation, repair of the middle one-quarter of the
face, orbital floor reconstruction, and open nasal bone reduction.
[3]
[
9
]
The defence argues that the Crown has not met
its burden to prove that Mr. Cappella caused the wounding. This argument rests
on two planks. First, the defence argues that Mr. Cappella struck Victor
Renzella in the back of the head. He thus could not have caused the injuries to
his face. Second, soon after being struck by the bat, another person punched Victor
in the face with a stiff uppercut. Taken together, I should have a doubt on
causation.
[
10
]
The element of causation asks whether Mr.
Cappella’s conduct was a significant contributing cause to the wounding:
R.
v. Theriault
,
2020 ONSC 3317
at para.
226
, aff’d
2021 ONCA 517
; see also
R.
v. Nette
,
2001 SCC 78
. Causation has both a factual and a normative
dimension. Factual causation asks whether the accused’s conduct contributed to
the result in a medical or physical sense. Legal causation is the normative
inquiry into whether that contribution is significant enough to attract moral
and legal responsibility. The requirement of a “significant contributing cause”
ensures that liability is not imposed for trivial or incidental links but only
where the accused’s act meaningfully caused the prohibited consequence—in this
case, the wounding; see
R. v. Triolo
,
2023 ONCA 221
at paras.
137-138
.
[
11
]
I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the strike with the baseball bat was a significant contributing cause to the
wounding. Importantly, I find as fact that Mr. Cappella connected with the right
side of Victor Renzella’s face and not the back of his head. I thoroughly reviewed
all the video clips of the incident and watched them at regular speed and in
slow motion.
[4]
In the split second before the blow, given the position of Victor’s head
relative to the direction of Mr. Cappella’s swing, it would have been unlikely
for the bat to strike the back of the head on its path. Furthermore, Victor
grabbed the front or side of his face
before
receiving the uppercut from
the other party. Grabbing the area of his face that suffered wounding, before
receiving any further blows, is a significant indicator of where Mr. Cappella’s
strike landed.
[
12
]
I acknowledge that Victor Renzella first grabbed
the back or top of his head. But his hands then shifted towards the front and
side of his face
before
the subsequent uppercut, as visible on Exhibit 5
starting at 0:00:03 and Exhibit 9 at 0:00:52. In both video clips, Victor’s right
ear is visible and serves as a reference point for the parts of his head and
thus the location of his hands. It is apparent that his hands were not
positioned on the back of his head. His arm position—tucked towards his chest
with a right angle between his upper and lower arm—also supports that his hand was
on the front of his face.
[
13
]
On the defence theory, Mr. Cappella struck
Victor Renzella on the back of the head, causing no discernible injury, and the
other party then uppercut him in the face, causing all the injuries. That
theory is neither reasonably possible nor plausible. Mr. Cappella advanced
several steps toward Victor and delivered a forceful blow to his head with an
aluminum bat. There was nothing to block or absorb the impact. The only
reasonable inference is that Mr. Cappella’s strike was a significant
contributing cause of the injuries. It may very well be that the uppercut also contributed
to the injuries. But factual causation is not limited to the most significant
cause:
R. v. Maybin
,
2012 SCC 24
at para.
20
. Whether a later blow also
had some role to play in the injury is of no legal consequence:
R. v.
Rocchetta
,
2016 ONCA 577
at para.
20
.
[
14
]
In conclusion, I am satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Cappella’s strike factually contributed to the
wounding and was significant enough to attract moral and legal responsibility.
Issue #2: Did defence of person permit the aggravated
assault?
[
15
]
The defence argues that Mr. Cappella’s strike to
the head of Victor Renzella was permitted by the defence of a third party under
s. 34
of the
Criminal Code
. The defence does not claim self-defence. I
agree there is no air of reality to self-defence. Rather, the defence asks me
to infer that Mr. Cappella was defending his friend Zach Pereira, who was
engaged at the time with Lucas Renzella.
Factual overview
[
16
]
I will briefly summarize the events when the
fight broke out. Victor and Lucas Renzella were verbally engaged with Mr.
Cappella’s group when Nicholas Renzella rushed on scene. Nicholas pushed
someone as that person swung at him.
[5]
The two then exchanged blows, triggering the broader fight.
[
17
]
Lucas and Mr. Cappella began fighting
one-on-one. I accept that Lucas was attempting to disarm Mr. Cappella, but Mr.
Cappella maintained control of the bat. Victor pushed Lucas aside and
positioned himself between Lucas and Mr. Cappella. Mr. Cappella swung the
bat at Victor, who blocked the strike with his left arm. Photographs confirm an
injury to that arm.
[
18
]
Mr. Cappella retreated several steps, placing
himself on the outskirts of the fray. Victor turned his attention away from Mr.
Cappella and looked toward the area where others were fighting. I accept that
Victor saw his son Nicholas engaged in a fight with multiple people. Victor
moved toward that group and adopted an “active” stance; his hands were raised
slightly near his waist. He did not assume a “fighting” stance; he neither
clenched his fists nor raised his hands to shoulder level. It does not appear
that Victor contacted anyone in that group, except possibly his son Nicholas.
With Nicholas now lying on the ground, Victor looked toward his other son Lucas,
who was fighting two people, one of whom was Zach Pereira. At this point, Mr.
Cappella struck Victor in the head with the bat. Victor could not see Mr.
Cappella approaching.
Statutory provisions and legal principles
[
19
]
Section 34(1) explains that a person is not
guilty of an offence if:
(a)
they believe on reasonable grounds that force is being used
against them or another person or that a threat of force is being made against
them or another person;
(b)
the act that constitutes the offence is committed for the
purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person from that use
or threat of force; and
(c)
the act committed is reasonable in the circumstances.
I must consider
the factors in s. 34(2) when assessing the reasonableness of the act.
[
20
]
There are several important legal principles
that guide my analysis. First, I cannot measure Mr. Cappella’s actions to a
nicety. I have the advantage of assessing his conduct from the calm of the courthouse,
aided by multiple video clips from different angles that can be slowed and
replayed. Mr. Cappella enjoyed no such luxury. He acted in real time amidst
chaos without opportunity for subtle reflection:
R. v. Cunha
,
2016 ONCA
491
at para.
7
.
[
21
]
Second, Mr. Cappella was not obliged to testify.
I accept that the evidence, including the video clips and testimony of Mr.
Cappella’s friends, can supply an air of reality to the defence: see e.g.,
R.
v. Lam
,
2025 ONSC 4534
at paras.
109-110
, 135-140.
Once an air of
reality exists, the onus rests firmly on the Crown to disprove an element of the
defence beyond a reasonable doubt:
R. v. Khill
,
2021 SCC 37
at
para.
18
. Mr. Cappella is not required to prove that he acted to
defend someone.
[
22
]
Third, the analysis examines the entire context.
I must consider the conduct of the parties from the beginning of the incident
to the end:
Khill
at para.
82
. “This broad temporal frame allows
the trier of fact to consider the full context of the accused’s actions in a
holistic manner”: para. 83.
Analysis
[
23
]
I conclude that defence of person does not apply
to the charge of aggravated assault. My reasoning will centre on how the Crown
has proven that Mr. Cappella’s conduct was unreasonable.
[6]
In other words, the Crown has disproven
beyond a reasonable doubt the requirement that his actions be reasonable.
[7]
[
24
]
The reasonableness condition aims to balance the
security of the person defended with the security of the person acted upon. The
standard casts a wide net of inquiry covering how the act occurred and the role
that each person played. The objective standard is modified to consider some of
Mr. Cappella’s characteristics. However, my task is not to slip into his mind.
The focus remains on what a reasonable person would have done in the
circumstances:
Khill
at paras.
62-65
.
[
25
]
I will review each factor from s. 34(2) to guide
my analysis of whether Mr. Cappella’s conduct was reasonable:
The nature and
imminence of the threat
[
26
]
It is convenient to address the first two
factors together. It is relevant that Victor Ranzella had not yet laid hands on
the people that Mr. Cappella was supposedly protecting. The screenshot of the
video clip from Exhibit 9 at 0:00:50 shows the moment when Mr. Cappella had
already begun his swing. Mr. Cappella is on the left. Victor is in the middle
of the frame, looking at the three people standing and fighting. He remained
some distance from them. The position of his hands did not suggest that he was
going to punch them. While a defender is certainly not required to wait for an
attack to materialize before responding, Mr. Cappella resorted to an elevated
level of force to respond to a threat of force that was not particularly
imminent. Mr. Cappella also had other means available to deal with the
situation. I will address those when assessing the proportionality of his
response.
Mr. Cappella’s
role in the incident
[
27
]
Mr. Cappella’s conduct in the build-up to the
fight undercuts the reasonableness of his eventual response. I find that he was
antagonistic throughout the encounter. To borrow the term from para. 84 of
Khill
,
he was hotheaded. The screenshot of the video clip from Exhibit 3 at 0:00:48
shows him pointing the bat at the Ranzellas. He followed it with taunting
vocalizations (“ohh” and “ah ah”). He shouted, “You guys actually getting
clapped up right now, right in front of your fucking [kids or cribs]. You wanna
get clapped up in front of your fucking crib? I’ll take my shit off right now”.
[8]
[
28
]
Whether Mr. Cappella’s words attract criminal
liability is a separate question that I will address later.
[9]
Even if they do not, the words
remain relevant:
Khill
at para.
84
.
[10]
They demonstrate that Mr. Cappella was not a passive bystander swept into
circumstances he had no hand in creating. His behaviour aggravated tensions and
sustained the volatility of the situation:
Khill
at para.
87
. I reject the
suggestion proffered by the defence witnesses that Mr. Cappella was merely
joking. His words, actions, and demeanour on the video clips establish
otherwise.
[
29
]
I do not suggest that the Renzellas were
friendly or benign observers during the build-up to the fight. They were
aggressive in their own right. They came in hot. Lucas declared that they came there
to “fix shit”. However, Mr. Cappella not only reciprocated their hostility; he
escalated it, injecting volatility into an already fraught situation.
Use of a weapon
[
30
]
Mr. Cappella was the only person that night who
possessed a weapon. He used it to strike the unarmed and defenseless Victor
Renzella. Mr. Cappella obviously knew that Victor was unarmed. Victor had
nothing in his hands and made no movement to his waist. There is no suggestion
that he could have been hiding something in his shorts or tank top. I also put
no weight on the speculation from Leo Kantartzis and Matthew Spadaro that a
Renzella brother might have possessed a weapon. The video clips provide no
indication that any Renzella was potentially armed. Regardless of what the
defence witnesses might have believed, I decline to infer that Mr. Cappella
suspected his opponents were armed.
Size, age,
gender, and physical capabilities
[
31
]
When examining the personal characteristics of
the parties, the defence focused on the evidence concerning Mr. Cappella’s
enlarged spleen. Because of the serious risk of splenic rupture from blunt
trauma, he was advised to avoid contact sports. Apart from this condition,
there was nothing about Mr. Cappella’s size or age that placed him at a
disadvantage that night. He was among the larger individuals involved in the
altercation.
[
32
]
Khill
at para.
65
provides helpful guidance on how to factor Mr. Cappella’s enlarged spleen into
the analysis. I must ask: what would a reasonable person with a similar
physical ailment have done in the circumstances?
[
33
]
Mr. Cappella’s ailment does not materially
inform the defence of a third party. There is no suggestion that those he
purported to protect suffered from any condition that required his urgent
intervention. If anything, Mr. Cappella’s medical vulnerability should have
made him reluctant to engage at all. His escalation of the situation was
inconsistent with his apparent need to avoid any physical contact. Mr. Cappella’s
ailment could have explained his reluctance to drop the bat. It could have explained
him using the bat to keep people away
from himself
. It does not explain
using the bat to prevent Victor Renzella from approaching a third party.
[
34
]
Mr. Cappella’s youth and level of maturity are
also relevant considerations. Young men can be prone to impulsive or reactive
decisions when emotions run high and judgment is clouded. The reasonable person
in this analysis is not a monk meditating on a mountaintop. It is a young man
whose decision-making may be more impulsive and less tempered by experience.
History between
the parties
[
35
]
There is no evidence of any history between Mr.
Cappella and the Renzellas. Their encounter likely started across the fence
when Victor Renzella was complaining about the noise, although I cannot
speculate on Mr. Cappella’s precise involvement at that point. My analysis principally
begins when they first crossed paths in the parking lot.
Nature and proportionality of the response
[
36
]
Mr. Cappella’s disproportionate response plays a
weighty role in my conclusion that he acted unreasonably. He delivered a full
swing of an aluminum baseball bat to the head of Victor Renzella. His wind-up
started with his arm stretched backwards and the bat at knee-level.
[11]
Having moved to the outskirts
of the fray, he advanced multiple steps to deliver the forceful blow.
[12]
He struck when Victor was
looking the other way. Victor’s behaviour once the fight broke out was
restrained. His actions were more defensive than offensive. The fact that Mr.
Cappella gripped the bat with one hand did not diminish the force of the blow. The
person that Mr. Cappella was said to be defending, Zach Pereira, was not in
dire straits. He was not calling for help. He was holding his own against Lucas
Renzella and enjoyed greater manpower on his side. The elevated force that Mr.
Cappella employed was grossly disproportionate to what was warranted in the
circumstances.
[
37
]
I remind myself again that I cannot weigh to a
nicety the conduct of a young man acting in the heat of the moment. Even with
that caution in mind, I find that Mr. Cappella had alternatives available to
him. He could have used the bat to push or cross-check Victor Renzella. He
could have struck him in a different body part. He could have started by
pushing Victor with his hands and still kept him away from his enlarged spleen.
At no point did Mr. Cappella attempt to de-escalate the situation with words. Instead,
he invoked violence and used taunts whenever he spoke.
Conclusion
[
38
]
Defence of person does not apply to the charge
of aggravated assault. The Crown has disproven its operation beyond a
reasonable doubt. The absence of testimony from Mr. Cappella has no bearing on
my conclusion. I draw no adverse inference from his decision not to testify. The
vicious blow with the baseball bat to Victor Renzella was completely unreasonable
and wildly disproportionate in the circumstances. His enlarged spleen did not
grant him a license to indiscriminately strike Victor in the head.
[
39
]
The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt
that Mr. Cappella applied force to Victor Renzella without his consent. The
force caused wounding. The Crown does not need to prove that the wounding was
intentionally inflicted. The Crown has proven an objective foreseeability or
risk of bodily harm from the blow:
R. v. Theriault
,
2020 ONSC 3317
at
para.
225
. The Crown has therefore proven the charge of aggravated assault
beyond a reasonable doubt.
Issue #3: Did Mr. Cappella attempt to kill
Victor Renzella?
[
40
]
The next question is whether Mr. Cappella attempted
to kill Victor Renzella. The crime of attempted murder requires proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill, coupled with conduct done
for the purpose of carrying out that intention:
R. v. Boone
,
2019 ONCA
652
at para.
49
. Mr. Cappella’s intent is the main issue here. The
intention to inflict significant harm, combined with recklessness as to the
consequence of inflicting that harm, does not suffice to establish the
mens
rea
for attempted murder:
Boone
at paras.
51, 57
.
[
41
]
I outlined most of the relevant context when
addressing the charge of aggravated assault. The Crown principally relies on
the following evidence to prove the charge of attempted murder:
(1)
Mr. Cappella made utterances before the fight
indicating that he would kill the Renzellas. He can be heard on Exhibit 8 around
0:00:28 declaring, “I’ll fucking kill you”. He asked the Renzellas if they
wanted to get “clapped up”. Witnesses also testified to Mr. Cappella saying, “Don’t
come any closer or I’ll kill you”. Some witnesses described the threats as
defensive in tone, intended to keep the Renzellas at a distance.
(2)
Mr. Cappella executed a vicious blow with an
aluminum bat to Victor Renzella’s head. He took multiple steps and struck with
force. He attacked when Victor’s attention was elsewhere, making him unable to
defend himself. One could argue that Mr. Cappella waited to strike until Victor
was looking the other way.
(3)
Mr. Cappella fled the scene and did not render Victor
any aid.
[
42
]
The Crown has not discharged its burden to prove
the charge of attempted murder. Intent to kill is not the only reasonable
inference. Indeed, I am quite certain that Mr. Cappella did
not
intend
to kill Victor Renzella. He intended to cause significant harm and was reckless
to the consequences. In reaching this conclusion, I will assume for the sake of
the analysis that Mr. Cappella’s flight is probative on the issue of intent:
see
R. v. Campbell
,
2018 ONCA 837
at para.
12
; but also see
R. v.
Rodgerson
,
2015 SCC 38
at paras.
37-38
.
[
43
]
The evidence does not establish the
mens rea
for attempted murder. Mr. Cappella only delivered a single blow, albeit a
forceful one to the head, that left Victor on his feet. Mr. Cappella fled the
scene soon thereafter.
[13]
That sequence undermines the inference that he intended to kill Victor. Had he
truly intended to kill, I would have expected him to strike again when his
target remained upright and was vulnerable; see e.g.,
R. v. Raymond LeRoy
,
2022 NSSC 272
at para.
133
(e). The Crown asks me to infer intent from the
earlier death threats. That chain of reasoning is too simplistic. A person who
utters threats and later commits a serious assault does not necessarily intend
to kill. While I rejected earlier the notion that the threats were jokes, they
appear to have been the product of bravado and youthful posturing rather than a
genuine expression of homicidal intent. Finally, placing undue weight on the precise
timing of the strike as proof of intent dissects the scene in a way that
ignores its chaotic reality.
[
44
]
I must consider the evidence in its totality:

. I must evaluate the cumulative
effect of the threats, the vicious blow, the timing of the blow, and the
post-offence conduct. Examined holistically, I am left in doubt on whether Mr.
Cappella intended to kill Victor Renzella.
Issue #4: Did Mr. Cappella commit assault for
striking Lucas Renzella?
[
45
]
Mr. Cappella stands charged with using a weapon
to assault Lucas Renzella. The evidence discloses multiple potential routes to
liability on this count. Here, under Issue #4, I will analyze whether Mr.
Cappella is culpable for
striking
Lucas Renzella with the baseball bat. Later,
under Issue #5, I will address whether he is culpable for swinging the bat at
him
without making contact
.
[
46
]
The evidence identifies two occasions when Mr.
Cappella might have
struck
Lucas with the bat. I will examine each in
turn.
Striking Lucas Renzella before the fight broke
out
[
47
]
The Crown relies on Lucas Renzella’s testimony
that the first physical blows occurred almost immediately after he and Victor
approached Mr. Cappella. Lucas stated that Mr. Cappella swung the bat and
struck him twice on the left side near his shoulder and ribcage.
[14]
This assault is said to have
occurred before the wider fight erupted. It was not captured on any of the
video clips but was supported by Victor’s testimony.
[
48
]
I am left in doubt that Mr. Cappella struck
Lucas with the bat before the fight broke out. Lucas’s evidence on this point
shifted in a material way. In his initial statement to the police, and months
later when he spoke to them again,
[15]
Lucas did not say that he had been struck twice before the fight broke out. He
relayed this information for the first time at trial. When confronted with the
omissions, his explanation was not compelling. While he might have been
flustered during the initial statement, the second one was taken months later
in calm conditions and after an opportunity to reflect. The inconsistency is
not peripheral; it goes to whether the alleged force occurred and preceded the
ensuing disorder.
[
49
]
The difficulties are not confined to that inconsistency.
Lucas’s evidence was unclear on where and how the alleged strikes could have
occurred. At points he accepted that there was effectively no space to swing a
bat between the two vehicles through which he and his father entered,
[16]
yet elsewhere suggested that
the blows occurred in that area.
[17]
Furthermore, the plausibility of Lucas’s account is strained by what follows on
the video: he continued to speak animatedly, gestured broadly, and advanced
toward Mr. Cappella without any outward indicia of the “seven
‑
out
‑
of
‑
ten” pain he attributed to a rib strike.
[18]
Later, it required only a
single push by Nicholas Renzella for the wider fight to erupt—yet, on Lucas’s
version, two earlier bat blows of fairly significant force did not trigger any
comparable reaction. Those positions are difficult to reconcile.
[
50
]
None of this analysis leads me to find that
Lucas or Victor gave deceitful testimony. The encounter was chaotic and sincere
witnesses can be mistaken. In that context, the video record is the most
reliable objective record available. It does not capture the strikes that Lucas
described at trial. I am left in doubt that Mr. Cappella struck Lucas with the
bat before the broader fight broke out.
Striking Lucas
Renzella during the fight
[
51
]
Mr. Cappella struck Lucas with the bat once the
fight broke out. These strikes might have caused his injuries.
[19]
I can see the strikes on the
video clips that show the opening moments of the fight.
[20]
The strikes ended when Victor
intervened.
[
52
]
The strikes during the fight cannot ground
culpability for the assault because I am not satisfied that the Crown has met
its burden of disproving self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt. I will examine
each element of the defence.
The catalyst: s. 34(1)(a)
[
53
]
The first question examines the catalyst: did
Mr. Cappella subjectively believe, on reasonable grounds, that force was being
threatened against him? The Crown has not disproven this condition. The video
clips support a reasonable inference that Mr. Cappella perceived an imminent
threat. Lucas Renzella was advancing toward him, and Mr. Cappella’s response
was directed at the perceived use of force. From what I can tell, the bat
strikes occurred only after Lucas physically engaged with him.
[
54
]
I am not suggesting that Lucas acted with undue
aggression. I accept his testimony that he was trying to disarm Mr. Cappella of
his bat. Nevertheless, from Mr. Cappella’s perspective, he faced an individual
closing in with arms raised—a posture that could reasonably be interpreted as
threatening.
The motive: s.
34(1)(b)
[
55
]
The second question examines the motive: did Mr.
Cappella strike Lucas for the purpose of defending himself from the threat of
force? The Crown has not disproven this condition. It is a reasonable inference
that Mr. Cappella was responding to Lucas’s use or threat of force. Even though
Mr. Cappella had been antagonistic in the moments leading up to the fight, I cannot
find that his strikes were motivated by vengeance. He was not striking Lucas
merely because the chance had come to inflict the harm he had already intended.
The response: s. 34(1)(c)
[
56
]
The third and final question examines Mr.
Cappella’s response: was it reasonable in the circumstances? Parts of my
earlier analysis concerning the strike to Victor’s head continue to apply.
[21]
But the outcome here turns on
what is different. I will focus on those distinctions to illustrate my
conclusion that the strikes to Lucas were reasonable.
[22]
[
57
]
The blows to Lucas were more restrained than the
one to Victor. There is no evidence that Mr. Cappella struck Lucas in the head.
The force applied was comparatively modest. The proximity between Lucas and Mr.
Cappella limited the force of each swing, to some extent. The strikes occurred
while the two were locked in a physical struggle, with Lucas focused on Mr.
Cappella. At no point did Mr. Cappella advance on Lucas and deliver an
unprovoked swing; his actions were reactive and sufficiently proportionate to
the immediate struggle.
[
58
]
In asking what a reasonable person with a
similar physical ailment to Mr. Cappella would have done in the circumstances,
I am satisfied that the Crown has not disproven that it was reasonable for Mr.
Cappella to defend himself with the bat.
Conclusion
[
59
]
I am left with a reasonable doubt that the Crown
has disproven self-defence in relation to Mr. Cappella’s bat strikes against
Lucas Renzella during the fight. I appreciate that the strikes to Lucas and the
subsequent strike to Victor were only about five seconds apart. I must avoid
parsing the chaos during that brief interval to conclude that Mr. Cappella’s
mindset shifted neatly from “defender” to “aggressor”. But I emphasize two
points. First, I made no positive finding that Mr. Cappella was defending
himself when he struck Lucas; rather, the Crown failed to meet its burden on
that issue. Second, even a defender must respond reasonably. I was not
satisfied that the Crown had proven that the strikes to Lucas were unreasonable.
The circumstances of the later blow to Victor’s head were materially different,
compelling me to reach the opposite conclusion.
Issue #5: Did
Mr. Cappella commit assault by swinging at Lucas Renzella?
[
60
]
At various points during the build-up to the
fight, Mr. Cappella can be seen on the video footage swinging the bat toward
Lucas Renzella without making contact. The Crown only relies on one such swing
to establish culpability for assault with a weapon. This swing occurred around the
outset of the encounter. I must decide whether self-defence applies and whether
the Crown has proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
Factual overview
[
61
]
Exhibit 8 captures the swing in question between
0:00:00 and 0:00:02. The screenshot shows Mr. Cappella’s back with the bat in
his hand. Lucas Renzella, in the red shirt, has his hands in front of his face.
The clip shows Victor and Lucas Renzella walking through the gap between a Jeep
and a white car. Mr. Cappella is facing them. I find that this clip begins at
or near the outset of the encounter between Mr. Cappella and the Renzellas.
[23]
[
62
]
At that moment, the parties were about a few
feet apart. Mr. Cappella swung the bat toward the Renzellas while taking a small
step forward. Mr. Cappella gripped the bat with one hand. The motion was not a
full swing; it could be described as a wave. At its apex, the bat rose to about
head level, while Mr. Cappella’s hand reached shoulder height. Lucas
immediately raised both hands in a defensive posture, as if to block a possible
strike.
Application of self-defence
[
63
]
I conclude that the Crown has disproven beyond a
reasonable doubt the application of self-defence. Specifically, I find that the
Crown has disproven the catalyst and response conditions.
[24]
The catalyst: s.
34(1)(a)
[
64
]
I am not sure what Mr. Cappella believed. Whether
he thought the Renzellas were threatening force is uncertain.
[25]
What is certain, beyond a
reasonable doubt, is that any such belief was not held on reasonable grounds.
[
65
]
As outlined earlier in these reasons, I accept
that the Renzellas did not arrive on friendly terms. The blaring music and dispute
over the fence meant that Victor was already angry before he left his house.
There is evidence that he drove into the parking lot at some speed.
[
66
]
Nevertheless, the Renzellas’ agitated state did
not supply a reasonable belief that they threatened force at the outset of the
encounter when Mr. Cappella swung the bat. There is no evidence that they drove
anywhere near Mr. Cappella, nor any basis to infer that he observed how they
entered the parking lot. The Renzellas parked and got out to discuss the
situation. They had not touched anyone, invaded personal space, or uttered
threats of violence. Nothing in their conduct at this early point justified a
belief that a threat of force was forthcoming.
[
67
]
I do not accept the defence claim that someone
from the Renzella property shouted death threats from across the fence.
[26]
The witnesses at this trial exaggerated
the opposing group’s aggression and minimized their own.
[27]
Hayden Cripps, for example,
testified that Mr. Cappella never swung at the Renzellas nor “took a step
forward or swung forward to engage with them”.
[28]
This claim was plainly contradicted by the video evidence. Matthew Spadaro, for
his part, was driving when words were exchanged over the fence. He admitted
that he “couldn’t hear that much”.
[29]
Yet he attributed specific death threats to those across the fence. His credibility
on this point was seriously undermined in cross-examination.
[30]
The alleged threats are also
inconsistent with the Renzellas’ words and tone on the video during the early
stages of the parking lot encounter. Their attitude was tense but not in line
with people who had been issuing death threats.
[
68
]
It was reasonable for Mr. Cappella to believe
that he was being confronted. But it is not reasonable to perceive every
confrontation—even with a frustrated party—as a threat of force. The rule of
law demands some minimum threshold before a person can resort to physical
force. The threshold was not met here. The Renzellas had not yet done anything
that allowed Mr. Cappella to reasonably believe that they were threatening
force.
[
69
]
The defence emphasized how the Renzellas’ stated
purpose for attending the parking lot was to have the music turned off. Mr.
Cappella’s group complied almost immediately after the Renzellas exited their
vehicle, if not shortly before. Yet instead of going home, the Renzellas continued
to engage and move towards Mr. Cappella’s group. However, human behaviour does not adjust with mechanical precision to
changing circumstances. In a tense, unfolding situation, individuals require
time to perceive developments, process them, and decide on a new course of
action. The Renzellas’ continued presence, viewed in the totality of the circumstances,
did not support a reasonable belief that they threatened force when Mr.
Cappella swung the bat.
The response: s. 34(1)(c)
[
70
]
Having concluded that the Crown has disproven
the catalyst condition of self
‑
defence, my assessment of the reasonableness of Mr. Cappella’s
response can be brief.
[31]
In the alternative, I am satisfied that the Crown has also disproven the
reasonableness condition.
[
71
]
I begin by recognizing the factors that support
the reasonableness of Mr. Cappella’s response. Notably, I can tell that Mr.
Cappella tempered his swing with the bat. It was more like a wave. My
impression is that he had no real desire to hit the Renzellas. He was pulling
his punches, so to speak.
[
72
]
Two related facts drive my conclusion that the
response was unreasonable: the speed with which Mr. Cappella introduced a
weapon into the situation; and his decision to brandish that weapon before
facing any meaningful apprehension of force.
[
73
]
On the first fact, I infer that Mr. Cappella
decided to arm himself with the baseball bat at some point after the argument
over the fence and before the Renzellas arrived in the parking lot.
[32]
No one gave direct testimony
on him retrieving the bat, but he clearly had the bat once the Renzellas
arrived.
[33]
It is not as though he already had the bat when his group was congregating in
the parking lot (the group was not playing baseball at that time).
[34]
Rather, he made a conscious
decision to retrieve it.
[
74
]
On the second fact, I find that Mr. Cappella
decided to swing the bat at the Renzellas very early in the encounter. Much of
what I outlined when assessing the catalyst applies here. Even if Mr. Cappella
reasonably believed that the Renzellas threatened him with force, any such
threat of force was minimal and restrained in the brief interval before he
swung a weapon at them.
[
75
]
I must consider the relevance of Mr. Cappella’s
enlarged spleen and how a reasonable person sharing a similar ailment would
have responded. One argument is that it explains why he grabbed and swung the
bat, when such conduct would be premature for somebody else. One problem with
this argument is that I see no basis to find that the enlarged spleen played
any role in Mr. Cappella’s decision-making. The swing was not protective. Throughout
the encounter, he did not cover his torso or disengage to avoid risk. The swing
was antagonistic and escalatory, increasing the likelihood of a physical
confrontation. Given that the reasonableness analysis is objective, it might be
that this point fits better into the catalyst or motive conditions of
self-defence. In any event, even accounting for his ailment, it does little to
assist the objective reasonableness of his premature response.
[
76
]
Mr. Cappella had several other courses open to
him. I remind myself that he was a young man making real-time decisions in a
tense encounter. But those circumstances do not immunize his conduct from
scrutiny. He did not need to engage with the Renzellas at all. He could have
increased his distance rather than standing within a few feet. He could have limited
himself to words or tried to calm the situation, like Leo Kantartzis attempted
to do (who is also a young man I might add). I do not accept the defence
argument that the Renzellas were blocking his retreat. The availability of
these non-forceful options weighs against the reasonableness of Mr. Cappella swinging
the bat when he did.
Proof of the offence
[
77
]
The final question is whether Mr. Cappella’s
swing of the bat establishes assault with a weapon. The Crown must prove an
underlying assault and that it was committed while using a weapon. I find that
the Crown has proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
78
]
One path to assault is s. 265(1)(b): a person
commits assault when, by an act or gesture, they attempt or threaten to apply
force to another, and they have—or cause the other to believe on reasonable
grounds that they have—the present ability to effect that purpose. The relevant
mens rea
lies in the intent to threaten; the Crown need not prove an
intent to carry out the threat:
R. v. Horner
,
2018 ONCA 971
at paras.
14-16
.
[
79
]
Applying these principles, the swinging or
waving of the bat toward Lucas Renzella at fairly close range, coupled with a
step in his direction and Lucas’s position confined between two cars, amounted
to a threat by act with present ability. The moderated nature of the motion did
not detract from its aggressive and weaponized character. Lucas’s recoil and
bracing also reflected a reasonable belief in Mr. Cappella’s present ability to
apply force. Finally, I am satisfied that Mr. Cappella intended to threaten. It
is the only reasonable inference from his conduct. My earlier finding that Mr.
Cappella did not want to hit Lucas does not undermine this element of the
offence. Having rejected self-defence, the offence is complete.
Conclusion
[
80
]
I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that
Mr. Cappella assaulted Lucas Renzella with a weapon. He is not, however, liable
for striking or injuring Lucas.
Issue #6: Is Mr. Cappella guilty of uttering
death threats?
[
81
]
The final two counts charge Mr. Cappella with
uttering death threats to Victor and Lucas Renzella.
Factual overview
[
82
]
The threats occurred after Mr. Cappella swung the
bat at Lucas Renzella. The threats continued until the fight broke out. I rely
on the video to decide what words were uttered. The witness testimony is not
sufficiently reliable to determine any utterances unless it conforms to what I
can hear on the video.
[
83
]
After Mr. Cappella swung the bat, he rapidly
retreated. The swing clearly provoked the Renzellas. It caused them to shout,
“You think you’re a fucking tough guy? … Tough guy with the bat”. It led them
to fixate on his continued possession of the bat. They issued calls to put it
down. The parties moved into the open area of the parking lot away from the vehicles.
[
84
]
Slowly but surely, the Renzellas advanced on Mr.
Cappella and his group.  As the Renzellas gestured towards Mr. Cappella, the
latter asked in a high-pitched tone, “You guys want to fucking die? … Don’t
come closer … Don’t come closer or I’ll fucking kill you”. As others tried to
calm the situation, Mr. Cappella shouted, “You guys actually getting clapped up
right now, right in front of your fucking [kids or cribs]. You wanna get
clapped up in front of your fucking crib? I’ll take my shit off right now”. Mr.
Cappella then swung the bat again, which intensified Victor’s attention on the
bat and his calls to put it down. Nicolas Renzella soon arrived on scene and
the fight broke out.
Application of self-defence
[
85
]
I conclude that self-defence can apply to a
charge of uttering threats. Section 34(1) begins, “A person is not
guilty of
an offence
if …” [emphasis added]. The language is
all-encompassing. There is no textual, contextual, or purposive basis to carve
out the offence of uttering threats.
[
86
]
Even though Mr. Cappella played a provocative
role throughout the encounter, I am not satisfied that the Crown met its burden
to disprove that he uttered the threats in self-defence.
The catalyst: s. 34(1)(a)
[
87
]
The Crown has not disproven that, at the time of
the utterances, Mr. Cappella subjectively believed on reasonable grounds that
the Renzellas were threatening him with force. While I rejected the catalyst
condition during the earlier bat swing, the circumstances had shifted. The
Renzellas were now visibly agitated. Their comment “You think you’re a fucking
tough guy?” functioned as “fighting-words” language. Mr. Cappella had retreated
and did not materially advance during the relevant timeframe. It was the
Renzellas who kept closing the distance.
[
88
]
The Renzellas had not made physical contact with
anyone. I do not think that Victor or Lucas were looking to fight. I accept
their evidence in this regard. But by this point, their ongoing presence in the
parking lot raised a valid question about their motives. It was now reasonable
for Mr. Cappella to believe they were motivated to apply force.
The motive: s. 34(1)(b)
[
89
]
The Crown has not disproven that Mr. Cappella
uttered the threats for the purpose of defending himself from a perceived
threat of force. His highly charged language must be assessed alongside him repeating
“don’t come closer”. It is a reasonable inference that those words were
meant to deter approach and avoid a fight.
[
90
]
There is arguably some tension between my
earlier finding that the words were antagonistic and my finding here that they
were uttered for a defensive purpose. But the findings are compatible. Describing
the words as antagonistic is not the same as finding that Mr. Cappella intentionally
baited the Renzellas into a fight. Mr. Cappella’s manner of trying to make the
Renzellas back down was hotheaded, but his subjective aim remained sufficiently
defensive in nature.
The response: s. 34(1)(c)
[
91
]
The Crown has not disproven that Mr. Cappella’s
response was reasonable. Of significance is that the response was verbal, not
physical.
[35]
The foul
language
was unrestrained, taking the form of evocative death
threats. Yet the
response
was restrained. He shouted, he warned, he
created distance, he did not strike. Self-defence does not require civility; it
requires reasonableness. During this volatile moment, Mr. Cappella chose speech
over contact. That distinction helps explain why I adjudged certain bat swings unreasonable,
yet I consider the threats reasonable.
[
92
]
The threats were also proportionate to the
Renzellas’ ongoing advance.
[36]
The video from Exhibit 9 best reveals their steady march from one side of the
parking lot to the other. The music had now been turned off for some time. The
Renzellas still wanted something—whether an explanation, recognition of harm,
respect for the neighbourhood, or an apology—but they never precisely
articulated what would satisfy them. In that context, it was reasonable for Mr.
Cappella to respond with words to forestall their advance.
[
93
]
There are factors that weigh against the
reasonableness of Mr. Cappella’s response. He continued to hold the bat. By his
words, he implicitly threatened to use it.
[37]
I also cannot ignore that the Renzellas’ aggression escalated
because
Mr. Cappella had swung the bat at Lucas.
[38]
That prior act contributed to the volatility of the exchange.
Conclusion
[
94
]
It is a close call whether self-defence should
apply on the charges of uttering threats. But any residual uncertainty must be
resolved in Mr. Cappella’s favour. The Crown has not discharged its burden to
disprove self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt.
Verdicts
[
95
]
Mr. Cappella is found not guilty of attempted
murder (count 1), uttering a death threat to Victor Renzella (count 3), and
uttering a death threat to Lucas Renzella (count 4). He is found guilty of assault
with a weapon (count 2) and aggravated assault (count 5).

Who initiated the physical contact was an issue at trial. In my
view, the only reasonable characterization is that they acted simultaneously.
Even if the video could be slowed to reveal that one moved a fraction of a
second before the other, the participants were not moving in slow motion. The
exchange occurred in real time. Their actions were effectively concurrent.

decision to flee when he likely saw Victor get the uppercut that sent him to
his knees.

The analysis is not premised on juxtaposition. The strike to Lucas is not

Victor (or vice versa).
[23]
This finding is supported by the testimony of Leo Kantartzis, October 16, 2025

[24]
I make no comment on whether the Crown has disproven the motive condition.
[25]
The count charges an assault against Lucas Renzella. But to the extent that Mr.
Cappella saw Victor and Lucas acting in concert, it is only fair to Mr.
Cappella to assess them collectively.
[26]
See for example the testimony of Hayden Cripps, October 15, 2025 at pp. 156,
183, and Matthew Spadaro, October 16, 2025 at p. 83.
[27]
For example, Hayden Cripps testified that he heard someone from the Renzella property
shout “turn that fucking music off, or we’re coming over there to fucking kill
you”. Yet he described his own group’s expletive-laden response as mere joking.
Similarly, Matthew Spadaro apparently heard the same threats yet characterized
his group’s response as “just banter and I don’t think it was anything
malicious”. This testimony was slanted and undermined their credibility on
these points.
