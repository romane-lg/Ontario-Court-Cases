Introduction:
[
1
]
On March 12, 2025, Agata Trabinski pleaded
guilty to assault causing bodily harm to Amanda Heath, contrary to
section 267
(b)
of the
Criminal Code
. The Crown proceeded by Indictment. I heard
sentencing submissions on September 2, 2025, and reserved my decision on
sentence to today. These are my reasons.
[
2
]
In support of the guilty plea, Ms. Trabinski
agreed to the following facts:
On the evening of Tuesday, December 1st,
2020, at approximately 9:00 PM, Peel Police responded to a medical assist call
near Hurontario Street and Dundas Street in Mississauga. Upon arrival, officers
found the victim, Amanda Heath, suffering from serious facial injuries,
including a 5-inch gash on her left cheek and a 2-inch cut on the left side of
her head.
The investigation revealed that prior to
the incident, Amanda Heath had been at the Mountfort Restaurant located at 60
Dundas Street East, Unit #1, in Mississauga. She was accompanied by her friend
Kumar Lawrence. Also present at the restaurant was the accused, Agata
Trabinski, who had no prior acquaintance with Ms. Heath.
A verbal altercation broke out between Ms.
Trabinski and Kumar Lawrence, which quickly escalated. During the argument, Ms.
Trabinski overturned a table, which struck Amanda Heath in the head. The
situation escalated when Ms. Trabinski threw a beer bottle at Ms. Heath,
followed by a second glass bottle, both of which struck her [Ms. Heath] on the
left side of her head.
As a result of the assault, Ms. Heath
sustained significant injuries requiring medical attention. She received 18
stitches to close the gash on her cheek and three staples to treat the cut on
her head. Photographs were taken to document the extent of her injuries.
The Victim Impact:
[
3
]
Ms. Heath described enduring profound emotional
trauma following the violent assault on December 1, 2020. She has suffered from
persistent hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Everyday
experiences such as travelling through Mississauga, being in crowded spaces, or
hearing loud noises trigger panic attacks and emotional distress. Her ability
to engage in normal activities like shopping, using public transit, and
watching action-packed media has been severely affected. She also experiences
intense discomfort around the smell of alcohol, particularly beer, due to its
association with the attack. The incident has led her to keep her phone on
silent nearly all the time to avoid triggering sounds, resulting in missed communications.
Social media interactions, especially those involving unknown contacts, cause
her anxiety due to previous unwanted contact from the accused. Her fear of
encountering Ms. Trabinski in public remains constant, especially while
travelling between Hamilton and Marmora to care for her terminally ill mother.
[
4
]
Ms. Heath also expresses ongoing fears for her
personal safety and that of her family. She avoids public spaces and remains
constantly alert, fearing she might encounter the accused again. Her sense of
security has been deeply compromised, and she continues to live with the
psychological and physical consequences of the assault.
[
5
]
Physically, Ms. Heath sustained serious
injuries, including a deep facial gash and head trauma. As previously
mentioned, it took 18 stitches to close the wound on her cheek and three
staples for the cut on her head. The injuries have left her with permanent
scarring and nerve damage, causing chronic pain and sensitivity to temperature
changes. Her face remains asymmetrical and distorted, affecting her self-image
and interactions with others. The trauma also disrupted her menstrual cycle,
leading to an average of two cycles per month since January 2021, which has
further impacted her emotional stability. The visible scar has led to judgment
from others, complicating her efforts to find housing and reintegrate socially.
[
6
]
Economically, Ms. Heath has faced financial
burdens due to the incident. These include the cost of ambulance services,
topical scar treatments, and transportation expenses for medical and specialist
appointments. These costs have added stress to an already overwhelming
situation.
The Offender’s Background:
[
7
]
After entering the guilty plea, a Pre-Sentence
Report (PSR) was prepared. Most of the offender’s background information has
been gathered from that Report.
[
8
]
Ms. Trabinski is a 42-year-old Canadian citizen who immigrated to
Canada from Poland at the age of 20. Her early life was marked by instability
and trauma. She was raised primarily by her maternal grandmother in a household
plagued by alcoholism and abuse. Her grandfather and uncle were described as
"angry drunks," and her mother, who had moved to Canada earlier, was
largely absent during her formative years. Ms. Trabinski's relationship with
her mother has remained strained, characterized by frequent arguments and
unresolved emotional wounds stemming from childhood neglect.
[
9
]
Ms. Trabinski's exposure to substance abuse began early. At age
16, while working at a hair salon in Poland, she was introduced to heroin by a
coworker. Her use escalated into a daily habit by age 19. After moving to
Canada when she was 20, she continued to struggle with addiction, though she
maintained employment as a hairdresser and described herself as a
"functioning addict." She experienced a brief period of sobriety
during her pregnancy with triplets (at the age of 24). Still, she relapsed when
they were eight months old due to postpartum depression and the overwhelming
demands of single motherhood. Her addiction later shifted to fentanyl, and she
has been on methadone treatment since 2018.
[
10
]
Her personal life has been equally challenging. Ms. Trabinski
married the father of her triplets in Poland and sponsored his immigration to
Canada, but he left the family shortly after arriving. They divorced when she
was 29 and the triplets were 5 years old. She has raised her sons with limited
financial support from him and significant help from her mother, despite their
difficult relationship. Her children were deeply affected by her arrest and the
public exposure of her charges, which they learned about through social media.
Her absence, from being in custody, has placed a heavy burden on her elderly
mother, who is now the sole caregiver and struggling financially.
[
11
]
Ms. Trabinski has a lengthy criminal history, including
convictions for drug possession, trafficking, and theft, dating back to 2008
and as recent as July 2025. Her compliance with probation has been
inconsistent, and she has repeatedly reoffended despite attending various
rehabilitative programs. She has also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder,
though at the time the Report was prepared, she was not receiving psychiatric
care. Friends and family describe her as emotionally volatile, with serious
anger management issues, especially when using substances. Despite these
challenges, she is also described as generous, caring, and deeply bonded with
her children.
[
12
]
Her employment history centres around hairdressing, a skill she
has practiced since her youth. She is regarded as talented in her field and has
expressed a desire to complete her education and pursue certification to open
her own salon. She hopes to resume work upon release and contribute to her
family's financial stability.
[
13
]
In the context of the current offence, Ms. Trabinski expressed
remorse and claimed the incident was triggered by fear and confusion. She
claimed that at the time, she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. She
stated that she did not intend to harm the victim and offered to help cover the
cost of plastic surgery for the injuries caused. However, the victim reported
ongoing harassment from Ms. Trabinski following the assault, which only ceased
after her arrest. The PSR concludes that while Ms. Trabinski shows some
willingness to change, she requires intensive support, including psychiatric
care, addiction treatment, and anger management therapy.
The Positions of the Parties:
[
14
]
The Crown argued for a custodial sentence in the range of 15 to
18 months, emphasizing the unprovoked and violent nature of the attack on Ms.
Heath, resulting in significant injuries. The Crown highlighted that the attack
was random, occurred in a public setting, and lacked any justification. Given Ms.
Trabinski’s criminal record, primarily drug and property-related offences, and
her poor history of compliance with community supervision, the Crown maintained
that a conditional sentence order sought by the Defence was inappropriate. The
Crown underscored that similar cases involving beer bottle assaults resulted in
custodial sentences. The Crown indicated the severity of the offence and the
need for both specific and general deterrence warranted incarceration.
[
15
]
The Defence proposed a conditional sentence order of up to two
years less a day, arguing that such a sentence could adequately address the
principles of sentencing under
section 718.2
of the
Criminal Code
. The
Defence emphasized Ms. Trabinski’s mental health challenges, including a
bipolar diagnosis and postpartum depression, as well as her long-standing
addiction issues that began in adolescence. Her personal history, marked by
instability, exposure to alcoholism, and lack of support, was presented as
context for her behaviour. The Defence highlighted her rehabilitation efforts,
including participation in programs at the Jean Tweed Centre, parenting
wellness initiatives, and counselling, all of which she sought independently.
The Defence argued that the level of violence should not automatically preclude
a conditional sentence, especially given the absence of planning and the
impulsive nature of the attack. The Defence contended that a well-structured conditional
sentence could achieve deterrence and rehabilitation without disrupting her
progress.
Analysis:
Sentencing Principles and Case Law:
[
16
]
Sentencing for assault causing bodily harm
involving a weapon varies significantly depending on the circumstances of the
offence, the offender’s background, and the presence of aggravating or
mitigating factors. The offence allows for prosecution either by summary
conviction (maximum 18 months imprisonment) or indictment (maximum 10 years
imprisonment). When a weapon is used, courts generally treat the offence more
seriously, often resulting in custodial sentences.
[
17
]
I am guided by
s. 718
of the
Criminal
Code
, which sets out the principles the court must consider when sentencing
an offender.
[
18
]
I must also consider the fundamental principle of proportionality
in s. 718.1, that the fitness of the sentence must reflect the gravity of the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
[
19
]
The primary principles for consideration are denunciation and
deterrence.
[
20
]
In
R. v. Tourville
,
2011 ONSC 1677
, Justice Code aptly
summarized the ranges of sentences for aggravated assault, which is helpful in
cases where there are factors similar to this case.
[27] The parties have helpfully provided me with a large
number of sentencing cases, dealing with the offence of aggravated assault.
That offence, contrary to
s. 268
of the
Criminal Code
, carries a maximum
sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. The cases disclose a wide range of
sentences. At the bottom end is an exceptional case like
R. v. Peters
(2010),
2010 ONCA 30 (CanLII)
, 250 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (Ont. C.A.) where an
Aboriginal offender received a suspended sentence and three years probation on
her guilty plea to aggravated assault. She was twenty-six years old with no
prior adult record. She had used a broken beer bottle in the assault, during a
bar room dispute, causing serious facial lacerations to the victim. The
"Gladue report" disclosed a very difficult upbringing in a violent
and abusive home, leading to alcoholism and drug abuse. By the time of
sentencing, she had obtained employment and was making real progress in
counseling for her substance abuse problems. Some of these features are not
dissimilar to the case at bar.
[28] In the mid-range are cases where high reformatory
sentences have been imposed of between eighteen months and two years less a
day. These cases generally involve first offenders and generally contain some
elements suggestive of consent fights but where the accused has resorted to
excessive force. See:
R. v. Chickekoo
(2008), 79 W.C.B. (2d) 66 (Ont.
C.A.)
;
R. v. Moreira
,
2006 CanLII 9709 (ON SC)
, [2006] O.J. No. 1248
(S.C.J.);
R. v. Basilio
(2003),
2003 CanLII 15531 (ON CA)
, 175 C.C.C.
(3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.).
........
[30] At the high end of the range are cases where four to six
years imprisonment have been imposed. These cases generally involve
recidivists, with serious prior criminal records, or they involve
"unprovoked" or "premeditated" assaults with no suggestion
of any elements of consent or self-defence. See:
R. v. Scott
,
[2002]
O.J. No. 1210 (C.A.)
;
R. v. Thompson
,
[2005] O.J. No. 1033 (C.A.)
;
R.
v. Vickerson
(2005),
2005 CanLII 23678 (ON CA)
, 199 C.C.C. (3d) 165 (Ont.
C.A.);
R. v. Pakul
,
[2008] O.J. No. 1198 (C.A)
.
[
21
]
In
R. v. Ali
,
2022 ONCA 736
,
the Court replaced a prison term with a conditional sentence of 15 months. The
Court of Appeal found that a conditional sentence can provide deterrence and
denunciation and may be "appropriate for a crime involving violence, such
as aggravated assault, even when deterrence and denunciation are paramount
considerations" (para. 27). Once the eligibility criteria for a
conditional sentence are set out in s. 742.1, then the imposition is not
excluded because it is a crime involving violence. The attack was not planned
or premeditated, but one victim was repeatedly kicked in the head.
[
22
]
In
Ali
, the Ontario Court of Appeal
stated that in cases involving violence, the court should consider the ability
of a conditional sentence to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation
and the other sentencing principles, including restraint and rehabilitation. At
para. 28, the Court stated that: "The trial judge should have considered
whether a custodial sentence or one served in the community would better
address all of the relevant sentencing objectives - denunciation and
deterrence
and
restraint and rehabilitation."
[
23
]
The Court referred to
R. v. Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)
, [2000]
1 S.C.R. 61, where the Supreme Court confirmed that a conditional sentence can
be a fit sentence where a case calls out for an emphasis on the sentencing
principles of denunciation and deterrence. At para. 22, the Court stated that a
conditional sentence can be more effective than incarceration at achieving
goals such as rehabilitation, it "is also a punitive sanction capable of
achieving the objectives of denunciation and deterrence".
[
24
]
The Court further stated that a conditional
sentence can provide "a significant amount of denunciation" and
"significant deterrence": at paras. 102, 105, 107.
[
25
]
In
R. v. Sharma
,
2020 ONCA
478
at para.
171
, the Court of Appeal stated that a conditional sentence
may be imposed “depending on 'the nature of the conditions imposed, the
duration of the conditional sentence, and the circumstances of the offender and
the community in which the conditional sentence is to be served': See
Proulx
,
at para.
114
; see, also, [
R. v. Wells
,
2000 SCC 10
, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 207], at para. 35.”
[
26
]
The Crown’s sentencing authorities demonstrated a consistent
pattern of custodial sentences for aggravated assaults involving beer bottles
or similar weapons, highlighting the principles of denunciation, deterrence,
and proportionality.
[
27
]
In
R. v. Peters
,
2010 ONCA
30
, the offender, an Aboriginal woman, struck the victim with a beer bottle,
causing severe facial injuries requiring 21 stitches. Despite the Crown’s
request for a custodial sentence of 12 to 18 months, the sentencing judge
imposed a suspended sentence with three years’ probation, citing Gladue factors
and restorative justice principles. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the
sentence, finding no error in principle. However, Justice Watt dissented,
arguing the sentence was manifestly unfit given the seriousness of the offence
and the offender’s prior youth record.
[
28
]
In
R. v. Walia
,
2016 ONSC
7495
, the offender threw a glass at the victim’s face during a domestic
dispute, resulting in permanent scarring. The Crown sought 12 to 15 months of
incarceration. The Court imposed a sentence of 12 months in custody followed by
one year of probation, rejecting the Defence’s proposal for a suspended sentence
due to the severity of the injury and the need to reflect denunciation and
deterrence.
[
29
]
In
R. v. MacDonald
,
2010
ONCA 178
, the offender threw a beer bottle at the victim’s face in a barroom
assault, knocking him unconscious and causing a jaw injury. The trial judge
sentenced him to 12 months in custody and 12 months of probation. The Ontario
Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, emphasizing the violent nature of the
offence and the importance of general deterrence, even for first-time
offenders.
[
30
]
In
R. v. Meredeth
,
2020 ONSC
7307
, the offender broke a beer bottle over one victim’s hand and used it to
slash another victim’s face at a wedding, causing permanent disfigurement. The
Crown sought a sentence in the range of two to four years. The Court imposed a
sentence of two years less a day in custody followed by two years of probation,
finding the offence fell within the mid-range of sentencing precedents and
noting the absence of Gladue factors or significant mitigating circumstances.
[
31
]
In
R. v. Moberg
,
[1988]
B.C.J. No. 2591
, the offender attacked the victim with iron bars, causing
multiple injuries. The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 18
months for assault causing bodily harm and six months concurrent for possession
of a weapon, citing the seriousness of the offence and the need for
denunciation.
[
32
]
Finally, in
R. v. Khan
,
2000 BCSC
102
, the offender stomped on the victim’s head after punching him, causing a
concussion and requiring stitches. The Crown sought 12 to 18 months of
incarceration. The Court imposed a nine-month custodial sentence, rejecting a
conditional sentence and emphasizing the gratuitous nature of the violence and
the importance of denunciation and deterrence.
[
33
]
Across these cases, courts consistently imposed custodial sentences
for aggravated assaults involving beer bottles, particularly where the injuries
were serious and permanent. While Gladue factors may justify non-custodial
sentences in exceptional cases like
Peters
, the prevailing judicial approach prioritizes
denunciation and deterrence, especially in cases involving public violence or
lasting harm.
Aggravating and Mitigating Factors:
[
34
]
In determining an appropriate sentence for Ms.
Trabinski, I have taken into account both the aggravating and mitigating
factors. The aggravating factors are considerable: the assault was unprovoked
and involved the use of dangerous objects, such as a beer bottle and a glass
bottle, causing serious bodily harm to the victim, Amanda Heath. The injuries
were not only physically severe, leading to permanent scarring and nerve
damage, but also psychologically traumatic, with lasting emotional effects and
financial hardship. Ms. Trabinski’s criminal record is extensive and includes
recent convictions, indicating a pattern of reoffending and a lack of benefit
from previous rehabilitative efforts. Additionally, the victim reported ongoing
harassment from the accused after the assault, which only stopped following her
arrest, raising concerns about remorse and the risk posed to public safety.
[
35
]
Balanced against these are the mitigating
factors. Ms. Trabinski entered a guilty plea, sparing the victim the stress of
a trial and accepting responsibility for her actions. Her background reveals a
history of trauma, addiction, and mental illness, including bipolar disorder,
which have contributed to her instability. She has expressed remorse and a
desire to make amends, including an offer to assist with the cost of plastic
surgery. She is also a single mother of three children, whose lives have been
disrupted by her incarceration. The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that while
her risk of reoffending remains high without intervention, she has shown some
willingness to engage in treatment and rehabilitation.
[
36
]
In balancing these factors, I must impose a
sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offence, the harm inflicted on
the victim, and the need to safeguard the public, while also acknowledging the
offender’s potential for rehabilitation. A custodial sentence is appropriate,
but it should be combined with conditions that facilitate Ms. Trabinski’s
access to psychiatric care, addiction treatment, and anger management
counselling, in the hope that she can eventually reintegrate into society as a
law-abiding citizen.
Decision:
[
37
]
I do consider the Crown's request for a sentence in the range of
15-18 months' jail to be reasonable. However, applying the principle of
restraint, I conclude that a 12-month period of incarceration is the lowest
possible sentence that would be consistent with the principles of denunciation,
general deterrence, specific deterrence and rehabilitation.
Is a Conditional Sentence Available?
[
38
]
The prerequisites for a conditional sentence set out in the
Criminal
Code
are as follows:
1.
The sentence imposed is less
than two years (s.742.1).
2.
The offence is not
punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment (s.742.1(b)).
3.
The offence is not attempt
murder, torture or advocating genocide (s.742.1(c)); and
4.
The offence is not a
terrorism offence, or a criminal organization offence, prosecuted by
indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more
(s.742.1(d)).
[
39
]
In the present case, the offence is assault causing bodily harm.
The offence is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment. The Crown is
seeking a sentence well under two years. Accordingly, a conditional sentence is
available.
Is a Conditional Sentence Appropriate in these Circumstances?
[
40
]
For a conditional sentence to be appropriate, pursuant to
s.742.1(a), I must be satisfied that:
(a)
Ms. Trabinski serving the sentence in the community would not endanger
the safety of the community; and
(b)
A conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose
and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.
Risk to the community:
[
41
]
In
R. v. Proulx
,
supra
, at para.
68
, the
Supreme Court of Canada interpreted "safety of the community" to
refer to the threat posed by the specific offender were he to serve his
sentence in the community.
[
42
]
The proper approach in assessing risk to the community involves a
consideration of (1) the risk of the offender re-offending, and (2) the gravity
of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. (See:
R. v.
Proulx
, at para.
69
.)
[
43
]
I have concerns about the risk posed by Ms. Trabinski. The behaviour
of viciously attacking an innocent victim, absent the influence of drugs or
alcohol, indicates underlying issues. Ms. Trabinski has had seven previous
periods of community supervision between January 12, 2008, and February 14,
2019. The PSR noted that her reporting habits were “sporadic and inconsistent.”
She has attended various counselling and rehabilitative programs to address
addiction and mental health issues during these times of community supervision;
however, she has continued to reoffend and struggles with anger management and
a serious drug addiction. Although she has recently reengaged with counselling
services since her release from custody in July 2025, I cannot conclude that
her underlying issues have been effectively addressed.
[
44
]
But, on the other hand, Ms. Trabinski has been effectively
managed in the community, having served a six-month and a 12-month conditional
sentence in 2013 and 2015, respectively, with no indication of her breaching
any conditions. I am also aware that Ms. Trabinski is successfully serving an
intermittent sentence to date.
[
45
]
I believe that appropriate restrictive and rehabilitative
conditions could be included in a conditional sentence to minimize the risk Ms.
Trabinski may pose to public safety.
[
46
]
Accordingly, I conclude that public safety is not a basis on
which a conditional sentence should be rejected.
Purpose and Principles of Sentencing:
[
47
]
I must consider whether a term of incarceration or a custodial
sentence served in the community would better address all the relevant
sentencing objectives - denunciation, deterrence, restraint, and
rehabilitation.
[
48
]
A lengthy conditional sentence with house arrest and counselling
conditions could and can achieve the goals of specific deterrence and
rehabilitation.
[
49
]
However, in my view, a conditional sentence would not adequately
address the paramount sentencing objectives of general deterrence and
denunciation that arise on the facts of this case.
[
50
]
The level of violence employed by Ms. Trabinski was fundamentally
different than what was present in
Ali
. In
Ali
, there was
significant provocation, as the victim had previously seriously injured the two
accused's younger brother. In
Ali
, both brothers used their hands and
feet to attack the victim. No weapons were used. No bones were broken.
Immigration consequences were also a factor.
[
51
]
The nature of the offence committed by Ms. Trabinski supports the
need for a custodial sentence. This was a violent, unprovoked attack using a
beer bottle and a liquor bottle as a weapon, resulting in permanent and
disfiguring injuries to Ms. Heath. Courts have consistently held that such
conduct demands a sentence that reflects the principles of denunciation and
deterrence. The case at bar closely resembles the facts previously cited in the
MacDonald
decision. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 12 months’
incarceration and 12 months’ probation for a similar beer bottle assault,
emphasizing the need to denounce violent conduct and deter others from engaging
in such behaviour.
[
52
]
Similarly, in the
Meredeth
, decision, the Court rejected
the Defence’s request for a suspended sentence, finding that the seriousness of
the injuries and the absence of exceptional mitigating factors required a
custodial disposition.
[
53
]
The presence of Gladue factors, a favourable pre-sentence report,
and a demonstrated trajectory of rehabilitation, distinguished the
Peters
decision. Ms. Trabinski’s case does not involve Gladue considerations, and
there is no indication of similarly exceptional circumstances that would
justify deviation from the norm.
[
54
]
Moreover, as emphasized in
Khan
, even in cases involving
first-time offenders, gratuitous violence undermines the appropriateness of a
conditional sentence. The court in
Khan
rejected a conditional sentence
for a first offender who committed a violent assault, stressing that such
leniency would fail to adequately reflect the gravity of the offence and the
need for public denunciation. Ms. Trabinski is not a first-time offender.
[
55
]
In my view, the aggravating factors greatly outweigh the mitigating
factors. The latter includes reengagement in some counselling for mental health
and addiction issues, and her guilty plea.
[
56
]
In summary, the seriousness of the offence, the lasting harm to
the victim, and the absence of exceptional mitigating factors would render such
a sentence manifestly unfit. A custodial sentence is necessary to uphold the
principles of proportionality, denunciation, and deterrence in the face of
serious, weaponized violence.
The Sentence:
[
57
]
As I have said, the period of custody to be served by Ms.
Trabinski is 12 months. This sentence is sufficient to denounce the serious
violent offence committed by Ms. Trabinski and deter others from similar
conduct. A period of probation following the custodial sentence will promote
Ms. Trabinski’s rehabilitation.
[
58
]
After completing the custodial sentence, Ms. Trabinski will be on
probation for a period of 12 months with the following conditions.
(i)
Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
(ii)
Appear before the court when required.
(iii)
Report to a probation officer immediately and
thereafter as required.
(iv)
Reside at an address approved by the probation
officer.
(v)
Notify the probation officer of any change in
name, address, or employment.
(vi)
Do not have any contact or communicate directly
or indirectly with Amanda Heath.
(vii)
Do not go within 100 metres of Amanda Heath’s
home, school, work or any other place you know her to be.
(viii)
Do not possess any weapons as defined by the
Criminal Code
.
(ix)
Attend and actively participate in any
assessment, counselling or rehabilitative programs as directed by the probation
officer to address anger management and substance abuse issues and sign any
release of information forms as will be necessary to monitor attendance and
completion of any recommended programs.
[
59
]
Pursuant to
section 743.21(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
,
Ms. Trabinski is prohibited from communicating directly or indirectly
with Amanda Heath during the custodial period of the sentence.
[
60
]
Pursuant to
section 109
of the
Criminal Code
,
Ms. Trabinski is prohibited from possessing: any prohibited firearm, restricted
firearm, firearm part, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited
ammunition for life and any firearm (other than one that is prohibited or
restricted), crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance
for a period beginning today and ending in ten years.
[
61
]
Assault causing bodily harm is a primary
designated offence. Ms. Trabinski must supply a sample of her DNA for testing
immediately.
[
62
]
The victim fine surcharge is waived, given her
financial circumstances.
