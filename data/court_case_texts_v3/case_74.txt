BROWN, J.
(Orally):
On March 25th,
2025, the day that Mr. Sacchetti was
to
start
a
preliminary
hearing
in
relation
to his charges, he entered guilty pleas
to various charges.
The Crown
proceeded by indictment.
On the
Information
ending
in
5326,
he
entered
guilty pleas to counts 5 and 12, which were that on August 18th, 2024,
he possessed a loaded restricted firearm, which was a Glock .22 handgun, in
Mississauga, contrary to
s. 95(2)
of the
Criminal Code
, and on the same
date and at the
same
place,
possessing
the
firearm,
the
Glock
handgun,
while
prohibited
based
upon
an
order made
pursuant
to
s.
109(1),
contrary
to
s.
117.01 of the
Criminal Code
.
He also entered a guilty plea on Information ending in 5771, to,
at the same date and place, possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 5(2) of the
CDSA
.
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
arrested
on
August
18th,
2024,
and has remained in custody to the date of his sentence, today, November 7th,
2025.
That is a total of 446 real
days in presentence custody.
An Agreed
Statement of Fact was filed in evidence,
together
with
the
relevant
s.
109 weapons
prohibition
order
that
was
the
subject
of the offence.
The court
found Mr. Sacchetti guilty of the various
counts
and
ordered
a
presentence
report. The case was put over for
sentence from time to time and is now before the court, finally, for the
imposition of sentence.
THE
FACTS:
A.
Circumstances
of
the
offence:
As noted
above, following the guilty plea to the relevant
charges,
an
Agreed
Statement
of
Fact
was filed in evidence.
It provided as follows:
On August
18th, 2024, officers attended 976 Mississauga
Valley
Boulevard
in
Mississauga
in
an
effort to locate and arrest the accused, Mr. Giovanni Sacchetti.
At 11:04 p.m., officers observed
Mr.
Sacchetti
pulling
into
the
driveway in
a
black
2014
Honda
Accord,
with
licence
plate CEES 066.
Officers
Neale, #11820, and Sljivo, #65711, arrested Mr. Sacchetti.
Officer Sljivo searched the
vehicle
incident
to
arrest
and
located
a
grey
Winners reusable bag on the floor of the passenger seat.
Inside this bag, the officers located
a
loaded
Glock
.22
handgun
with
one
round in the chamber.
The attached magazine contained nine
additional rounds.
The handgun had
the serial
number
UKD627.
The
bag
also
contained
a freezer-size bag and a sandwich bag
with other drugs.
There was also a
pill bottle which contained
oxycodone
pills.
The
pill
bottle
was labeled with a valid prescription in
Mr. Sacchetti’s
name.
Photos
of
the
contents
of
this
bag
at
the
time
of his arrest were attached at Exhibit A
of the Agreed Statement of Fact.
(See
Exhibit A - Photos of grey Winners Bag and Contents).
It was
determined that the freezer bag had a total of 1273.38 grams of oxycodone.
This was tested
by
Health
Canada
and
confirmed
to
contain oxycodone and
acetaminophen.
The sandwich bag had
a
total
of
118.76
grams
of
heroin.
This
was tested
by
Health
Canada
and
confirmed
to
contain heroin,
acetaminophen and caffeine.
After the
firearm was located, Officer Neale conducted a pat-down search of Mr. Sacchetti
for officer
safety.
He
located
a
red
and
black
Gucci bag on his person.
Inside this bag, D.C. Neale located $2,910
in Canadian currency, jewellery, condo keys with a fob, 0.55 grams of cocaine
and a cell phone.
Photos
of
the
Gucci
bag
and
the
visible
contents are attached at Exhibit B to
this Agreed Statement of Fact.
(See
Exhibit B - Photos of Gucci
bag
and
Contents).
Mr. Sacchetti
was advised of the further charges arising from these searches.
He was placed into the
custody
of
other
officers
who
transported
him back to the division.
The car
appeared to be lived in, as it contained a
number
of
bags
and
a
locked
safe
in
plain
view.
D.C.
Sljivo
discontinued
his
search
of
the
Honda. Police seals were placed on the
motor vehicle, and it was towed to Toronto Police Service - Forensic Services.
The following day a search warrant for the
vehicle was sought and obtained.
The
search
warrant
on
the
vehicle
was
executed
on August 19th, 2024.
The items listed below are separate and
apart from the items listed above. It
is
admitted
that
all
of
the
drugs
listed
below were possessed
for the purpose of trafficking. That
is
important,
this
court
would
note.
The following items were located by the
officers:
a)
978.96
grams
of
cocaine,
which
was
tested
by
Health Canada and confirmed to contain cocaine.
It is to be noted that this is approximately
0.979
kilos,
or
just
below
one kilo, which would be 1000 grams of
cocaine;
b)
1075.06
grams
of

Attached to
the Agreed Statement of Fact at Exhibit
C
are
photos
of
the
execution
of
this search
warrant.
(See Exhibit C - Photos of
Search Warrant Execution).
On October
10th, 2024, Mark Weber, a designated examiner
of
weapons
with
Toronto
Police
Service, examined
the
weapons
and
ammunition
found
in
the course of this investigation and
test-fired the various ammunition from the firearm.
Mr. Weber
determined that the firearm was a restricted firearm, as it was a
semi-automatic handgun
with
a
barrel
length
of
114
millimetres.
This means it is designed to be aimed and fired by the action of one hand and
to discharge conventional ammunition containing a projectile that is designed
to exceed the muzzle velocity and muzzle energy exemptions in the
Criminal
Code
.
Mr. Weber
determined that the extended magazine was
a
prohibited
device
under
the
Criminal
Code,
as
it
was
capable
of
holding
more
than
10
rounds
of ammunition.
It was able to hold up
to 31 rounds of .40 calibre ammunition.
Mr.
Weber
certified
all
of
the
bullets
recovered as
ammunition
within
the
meaning
of
the
Criminal Code
.
He was able to fire the .40 calibre
bullets - seized incident to arrest and in the search warrant - from the
firearm and indicated they were suitable for that purpose.
At the time of
his arrest, Mr. Sacchetti was consuming about three grams of cocaine or an
“eight
ball”
each
day.
He
developed
this
habit
in the months leading up to his arrest.
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
also
using
painkillers,
marijuana
and
alcohol
regularly.
The
defence
advised
the
court
that
Mr.
Sacchetti
had been prescribed Percocet following a workplace injury.
A Percocet bottle with a prescription in
his name was located in the search.
The
Crown
advised
that
the
pills
inside that bottle were not part of the
facts and quantities set out in the Agreed Statement of Fact related to the
criminal and drug offences.
The
defence
does
not
suggest
that
all
of
the
Percocet in this case was for personal use.
The
defence
advised
that
he
had
purchased
the heroin illegally, although he thought it contained Percocets, not
heroin mixed with
acetaminophen.
The Crown
takes the position that all of the drugs were possessed for the purpose of
trafficking.
The defence does not
take issue with
this,
although
indicates
generally
that
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
regularly
using
cocaine,
oxycodone and cannabis at the time of the arrest.
At the time of
the offence Mr. Sacchetti was subject to a s. 109 weapons prohibition order,
that
had
been
imposed
at
the
time
of
sentence
on a previous charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking in
cocaine, for 10 years, beginning January 22nd, 2022.
Accordingly, he had
been
on
this
order
for
less
than
three
years when he was possessing a handgun in
this case.
B.
Circumstances
of
the
offender
:
Mr. Sacchetti
has a criminal record, which has been
filed
in
evidence.
He
was
found
guilty
and sentenced on an
impaired driving offence on February 22nd, 2013.
Most
significantly,
however,
he
was
sentenced
on January 21 of 2022, in Milton, to a
charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking of a Schedule I substance
and, at the time, given an 18-month conditional sentence and a s. 109 weapons
prohibition order.
The
presentence report that was prepared, and before
the
court
as
an
exhibit,
has
been
reviewed very carefully by the court.
Mr.
Sacchetti
is
40
years
of
age,
married
and
has three children.
His children are 7, 5 and 2 years
of
age,
and
they
clearly
miss
their
father. His wife indicated that he is a
good father; their
relationship
had
some
issues,
and
they
were separated
just
prior
to
the
subject
offences,
but they have
reconciled.
He
does
not
have
an
Indigenous
background,
and Mr.
Sacchetti is a Canadian citizen.
He completed
high school, although he had some issues in school and was suspended for acting
out, swearing, not listening, fighting and skipping class.
The court would note that when he read his
statement earlier today, it appears that when he went back to school, he
received a special
designation
as
the
most
improved
student, which is noteworthy.
According to the presentence report, he has
recently been diagnosed with ADHD.
Mr. Sacchetti
had what has been described as an overall positive upbringing.
His parents were married, and they
remained together.
He was close with
his mother, who died in 2022.
He is
close to his brother, Vito, who describes him as a good father.
His brother was shocked to hear about
the
subject
offences
and
that
Mr.
Sacchetti
had a firearm.
His father
used physical discipline on Mr. Sacchetti,
but
Mr.
Sacchetti
said
it
was
never
for nothing and that the interactions never crossed the line.
He
has
been
employed
most
of
his
life,
working
in various jobs outlined in the presentence report. He at one point
opened his own cable-laying company,
but
the
work
ran
out
during
the
COVID-19 pandemic.
More recently he was employed by Sean
Dodds at a surveillance camera company.
Mr.
Dodds
speaks
highly
of
him
as
an
employee,
and
he
would
take
Mr.
Sacchetti
back
as
an
employee after the
charges.
Mr. Sacchetti
admits that he may have had an issue with alcohol in the past.
When he drank heavily,
this
led
to
him
abusing
drugs.
After
an accident at work when he was 28 years
of age, he became addicted to oxycodone.
He
would also use cocaine and GHB.
He
advised
the
author
of
the
presentence
report that while in custody he has completed various programs,
including a four-month reintegration program, anti-criminal thinking, healthy
relationships, finding employment, financial literacy, and he has attended
Bible study and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
The court
would note that the defence has provided to the court an email to confirm his
completion
of
the
Black
Employment
program
at
the Toronto South Detention Centre.
This is a program that ran from November
2024 to May of 2025.
The email spoke
in glowing terms of the nature of his participation in this program.
He
completed
his
conditional
sentence
without issue
and
would
be
deemed
suitable
for
future
community-based supervision.
Mr. Sacchetti
advised he sold the drugs for financial
gain
and
had
the
firearm
for
protection
while
selling
the
drugs.
He
indicated
his
regret
for committing the offences.
The
court would note that, as submitted by the defence, he was not an addict
trafficker.
He admitted that he
committed the offences for financial gain, although he may have had some of the
drugs for his own personal use.
The defence
also filed medical records relating to Mr. Sacchetti’s stay at the Toronto
South Detention Centre.
It noted his
history, including reference to chronic back pain and prior crack cocaine
usage.
It set out the medications
that he had been prescribed and the complaints he has had while in custody.
The court
does
consider
the
evidence
before
the
court today that he was denied the type of
pain medication, which were Percocets, that he had previously
been
taking
before
his
arrest.
As
the
court understands it, he was prescribed Advil, but he indicated that was not
sufficient to relieve
the
pain
that
he
was
suffering
from
while in
custody.
The
court
has
reviewed
all
of
the
22
pages
that it is able to read, that is to say all of the portions that are
legible, in detail.
A
number
of
character
reference
letters
were filed
by
the
defence
and
have
been
read
very carefully by this court.
His
cousin,
Danielle
Da
Silva,
prepared
a
letter.
She speaks positively of Mr. Sacchetti, indicating that he is a devoted husband
and father to three children; his family is very important
to
him.
He
had
a
hard
time
in
his
life
when he lost his mother to cancer, which was in 2022.
He helped his grandparents and her sister during a crisis.
He also helped his cousin who suffered a
sudden brain aneurysm.
His cousin,
Joseph Sacchetti, also prepared a letter
which
speaks
favourably
of
Mr.
Sacchetti.
He noted the help he had given his mother when she was ill, and that he
assisted in coaching youth soccer, working with the author and young boys.
He expressed remorse.
His friend,
Matthew Vaz, also wrote a letter of support.
He has known Mr. Sacchetti for 30 years.
He has a strong work ethic, and he is dedicated
and
hard-working.
He
and
Mr.
Sacchetti
have been there for each other, and he states that
Mr.
Sacchetti’s
kids
and
family
are
the
most important things in his life.
His wife,
Monica Sacchetti, also wrote a letter of support.
She loves him and will be there to support him as the father of
their three children.
In the year
before the offence, she indicated
that
he
turned
into
someone
she
did
not recognize because of his addiction.
She wanted him to change, and he left.
It was becoming a toxic environment for
their children.
He has apologized
several times and regrets the hurt he caused.
He misses his children and calls to speak
to
them
daily.
He
started
cutting
hair
for inmates, and he is
interested in enrolling in classes to cut hair and to become a barber.
His
father,
Luca
Sacchetti,
signed
an
affidavit for
bail
purposes.
He
was
prepared
to
act
as
a surety for Mr.
Sacchetti.
His brother,
Vita Sacchetti, also signed an affidavit
for
bail
purposes
and
was
prepared
to act as a surety for him.
His cousin,
Nico Sacchetti, also signed an affidavit
and
was
prepared
to
act
as
a
surety
for
him.
His
most
recent
employer,
Sean
Dodds,
also
signed
an affidavit and was prepared to act as a surety for him.
There is no
doubt that Mr. Sacchetti had a prosocial
employment
record
over
10
years
or
more
leading up to the subject offences.
There
is also no doubt that he has been motivated to rehabilitate
himself.
He
has
taken
the
Urban
Rez program, a lengthy program over many months, and done very well in
that program, as indicated in the materials.
He has also taken additional programming while in custody, to the extent
that he’s
been
able
to
do
so.
The
support
he
has
from family and friends are indicative of
him being motivated to continue to rehabilitate and do better.
His statement to the court, which was
heartfelt and this court found to be genuine, indicates that he has learnt a
lot from the experience he has had in the Toronto South Detention Centre.
While the court is disappointed that the
conditions at the Toronto South Detention Centre continue to remain
problematic, with lockdowns and triple bunking, Mr. Sacchetti has, nonetheless,
under great stress and dealing with adverse conditions, managed to make it
through his time in custody without
any
misconducts
while
at
the
jail.
Those are important prosocial factors for
him as an
offender.
Mr. Sacchetti
is also deeply upset about being away from his three children and his wife, and
there is no doubt, as indicated below, that the further jail term that both
parties are submitting
will
cause
continued
separation
of
Mr.
Sacchetti from his children and his wife.
This
is a factor that the court considers.
LEGAL
PARAMETERS
The
maximum
penalty
for
the
offence
of
possession
for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine, which is a Schedule I drug, is life
imprisonment.
The
maximum
penalty
for
the
offence
of
possession
of a loaded restricted firearm, contrary to
s. 95(2)
of the
Criminal Code
,
where
the Crown proceeds
by
indictment,
is
14
years
imprisonment.
The
maximum
penalty
for
the
offence
of
breach
of a s. 109 weapons prohibition order,
contrary to
s.
117.01
of
the
Criminal
Code
,
is
10
years
imprisonment.
POSITIONS
OF
CROWN
AND
DEFENCE
ON
SENTENCE:
The
Crown
position
is
that
the
appropriate
total sentence in this case should be 10
years, and ancillary orders should be made, including a weapons
prohibition,
a
DNA
order
and
forfeiture.
The
Crown
breaks
down
the
submission
in
relation to each of
the three subject offences.
On the
possession for the purpose of trafficking offence, the Crown has submitted that
the appropriate sentence would be seven years, although the Crown has submitted
this should be reduced
to
six
years
to
allow
for
application
of the principles of totality and
mitigating factors.
The Crown has
also submitted that the sentences for the other offences should be consecutive
to this charge and sentence.
Secondly,
the
Crown
submits
that
there
should
be
a sentence of four years’ jail, which the Crown has reduced in its submission
to three years in light of the principle of totality and the mitigating
factors
on
the
s.
95
possession
charge of the loaded firearm, and a further one year consecutive
for the possession of the firearm contrary to the prohibition order.
The Crown submits that it is appropriate
that those sentences have deducted from them appropriate credit for presentence
custody.
The Crown
requests a DNA order for the secondary designated
offences
of
the
firearm
charges
and
on the possession for the
purpose of trafficking offence.
The
Crown also requests a s. 109 order for life and a forfeiture order.
The defence
position is that a total of five years incarceration is appropriate as the
total for
the
drugs
and
the
firearm
count.
The
defence arrives at that
position based on his submission that the charge of possession of the firearm
can be a concurrent sentence to the possession for the purpose of trafficking
in drugs.
Following that, the defence
submits that the court should then add an additional six months incarceration,
consecutive to that five-year sentence, for the breach of the s. 109 weapons
prohibition charge.
The defence
argues, as set out later, that there should be a reduction in sentence based on
R. v. Marshall
,
2021
ONCA
344
,
for
the
harsh
conditions
in the jail.
Initially the position
was of six months, although subsequently the defence has argued for a much
greater reduction to lower the sentence.
The
defence submits that the court should deduct the
Summers
presentence
custody credit based on 1.5 days’ credit for each day spent in custody and, as
indicated, further enhanced
presentence
custody
credit
based
upon the conditions in the jail.
Again, the
defence submits that the firearms and drug charges, at least the s. 95 firearm
charge, can
be
concurrent
to
each
other.
The
Crown
takes the position that they should be
consecutive.
MITIGATING
AND
AGGRAVATING
FACTORS:
Mitigating
:
Mr. Sacchetti
has entered a guilty plea to three of
the
charges
he
was
facing.
He
did
that
on
the
day scheduled for the preliminary hearing to begin.
The value of the mitigation of a guilty plea is less at that
stage than it would have been had there been an early guilty plea.
The timing also resulted in a situation
where court time could not have been utilized for other cases.
Nonetheless, it is in mitigation of
penalty as it saved the Crown the need to prove the charges.
The Crown also
submits that there were essentially
no
triable
issues
in
this
case
and
no
Charter
arguments that were put forward.
It was essentially, this court would note, a strong case.
Mr. Sacchetti was found in the vehicle
containing the drugs, the firearm and the other items
referred
to
in
the
facts.
This
impacts
on the value of the mitigation arising
from the guilty plea.
The court
considers very carefully the lengthy statement of remorse made by Mr. Sacchetti
earlier
in
the
day
today,
which
the
court
accepts as genuine.
Mr. Sacchetti
has a past history of substance dependency.
In
the presentence report it was stated
that
he
may
have
had
an
issue
with
alcohol
in the past.
When he drank heavily,
this led to him
abusing
drugs.
Then,
when
he
was
28
years
of
age,
after
a
work
accident,
he
became
addicted
to oxycodone.
It was indicated
that he would also use cocaine and GHB.
In
a letter written by his wife, Monica Sacchetti, she stated in the year prior to
the offence he turned into someone she did not recognize because of his
addiction.  While he was a drug user, the court would find that it was a factor
in mitigation of a minimal level, given the commercial level of trafficking of
many
different
Schedule
I
and
other
drugs,
the large quantities of those drugs, and
that he had those drugs for trafficking and to make money.  It is important for
this court to note his statement made to the author of the presentence report
that
he
sold
the
drugs
for
financial
gain and
had
the
firearm
for
protection
while
selling
the
drugs.
There is
evidence of rehabilitative prospects evidenced
by
the
numerous
programs
Mr.
Sacchetti
has attended while incarcerated.
He
also has a great deal of family and other support, as demonstrated
by
the
letters
of
reference
and
the
affidavits filed with the court.
These
are indicative of prosocial aspects that the court considers with respect to
the appropriate sentences for him as an offender.
This is also referred to in the reasons.
Aggravating
:
Mr.
Sacchetti’s prior criminal record, including the one conviction and sentence
for the same offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking,
is
not
an
aggravating
factor,
but
it is a factor bearing on
the analysis of the need for specific deterrence and rehabilitation prospects.
He had completed the conditional sentence
for that offence a little over a year before he committed this subsequent
offence, and he is now also before the court for the serious firearms offence
and breached the weapons prohibition order.
Analysis:
The
court
bears
in
mind
the
guiding
comments
of the Supreme Court
of Canada in
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64 (CanLII)
, [2015] S.C.J. No. 64.
In that judgment, the court
stated
that
sentencing
ranges
are
primarily guidelines, not
hard and fast rules.
Even if an
appellate court has established a range, it may be that a fact pattern may
arise which is sufficiently dissimilar to past decisions that the range must be
expanded.
Sentencing ranges are
nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the
past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the
relevant principles and objectives.
However,
they should not be considered averages, let alone straightjackets, but should
instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who
must still exercise their discretion in each case.
Accordingly, a sentencing range is not a straightjacket
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
of
a
sentencing judge.
Each crime is
committed in unique
circumstances
by
an
offender
with
a
unique profile.
Everything
depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility
and the specific circumstances of each case.
Sentencing ranges must in all cases remain only one tool among others
that are intended to aid trial judges in their work.
The
court
specifically
considers
para.
73.
In
2010,
the
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
noted
in
R.
v.
Nasogaluak
,
2010 SCC 6 (CanLII)
, [2010]
1
S.C.R.
206
(S.C.C.)
,
at
para.
43
that:
“No one sentencing objective
trumps the others
and
it
falls
to
the
sentencing
judge to determine which objective or objectives merit the
greatest weight, given the particulars of the case.”
Sentencing is
highly individualized: see
R. v. Suter
,
2018
SCC
34
.
As
the
court
stated
in
para.
4:
“A delicate balancing of the
various sentencing principles and objectives is called for, in line with the
overriding principle that a ‘sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of
the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender’ (
s. 718.1
of the
Criminal
Code
)
. Accordingly, there will be cases where the particular circumstances
of the offence and/or the offender call for a sentence that falls
outside
of
the
normal
sentencing
range. This is one such case.”
In 2021, the
Supreme Court of Canada in
R. v. Parranto
,
2021 SCC 46 (CanLII)
, [2021]
S.C.J.
No.
46,
in
the
majority judgment
at
para.
10
noted
that
proportionality
is the organizing principle for the court in imposing a fair, fit and
principled sentence.  Proportionality is the fundamental principle. Sentences
must
be
proportionate
to
the
gravity
of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, and the
unique circumstances of each case.
Parity
and individualization are important,
yet
secondary
principles.
The
demands of proportionality must be
calibrated by reference to the sentences imposed in other cases.
Individualization is central to the
assessment of proportionality in that it demands consideration
of
the
individual
circumstances
of each
offender, as set out in para. 12.
As often
stated by appellate courts considering sentence appeals, every case has its
unique features
relating
to
the
offender
or
the
offence. The court has reviewed all of the cases referred to by
the defence and by the Crown.
The
absence of mention by this court does not mean that this court has not
considered a particular case.
It
simply reflects the court’s view that the circumstances in those cases are not
of assistance in considering the appropriate sentence in this case.
The
principle
of
proportionality
is
also
codified in the
Criminal Code
,
which states that the sentence imposed by the court must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the
degree
of
responsibility
of
the
offender
(see
s. 718.1
of the
Criminal Code
).
Further, the
court bears in mind that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect
society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect
for the law and
the
maintenance
of
a
just,
peaceful
and
safe society
by
imposing
just
sanctions
that
have
one or more of the objectives of
denunciation; deterrence (both generally and specifically for the offender);
separation of the offenders from society where necessary; rehabilitation; to provide
reparation
for
harm
done
to
victims
or
to the community; and to
promote a sense of responsibility
in
offenders
and
acknowledgment
of the harm done to victims or to the
community (see
s. 718
of the
Criminal Code
)
.
The court bears in mind any applicable sentencing principles as
set out in
s. 718.2
, and as well, the principles of parity, totality and
judicial restraint in considering a sentence of deprivation of liberty or
imprisonment, as set out in
s. 718.2
(b) through (e).
The emphasis of the
court
in
considering
those
various
objectives depends on
the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.
The court
considers the nature of the offence, together
with
the
circumstances
of
the
offender.
The court has
also noted an additional factor related to Mr. Sacchetti’s family.
As noted above,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
penitentiary sentence which the court will
impose on Mr. Sacchetti,
whether
as
submitted
by
the
defence
or as submitted by the Crown, or anything in between, will have a
significant impact on Mr. Sacchetti’s three children, who are 7, 5 and 2 years
of
age,
and
on
his
wife.
The
author
of
the
presentence report noted that the children miss their father.
His wife indicated that he is a good
father.
Their
relationship
had
some
issues, and
they
were
separated
just
prior
to
the
subject offences, but he and his wife
have now reconciled.
The court would
note that she was here earlier today.
The
family has, of course, been
living
separate
and
apart
from
Mr.
Sacchetti since he was arrested well over
a year ago.  Nonetheless, this is something which the court considers
pursuant
to
the
direction
of
the
Court
of Appeal for Ontario in
R. v. D.B
.,
2025 ONCA
577
.
Nature
of
offence:
The
court
has
reviewed
in
detail
all
of
the
cases
submitted by the defence, a number of which are referred to below.
The court has also reviewed in detail all
of the cases submitted by the Crown, a number of which are referred to below.
The
Crown
has
taken
a
slightly
different
approach than
the
defence
in
presenting
case
law
regarding the nature of the offences. The
Crown has separated the sentences for types of offences, being weapons
prohibition breach sentences, possession of prohibited firearm sentences,
possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine in the 978.96 gram range,
the purity of cocaine
and
cutting
agents,
the
toxic
combination of possessing drugs and guns, and adjusting for totality,
and in consecutive versus concurrent sentences.
The court will review those cases in the reasons relating to the
particular topic in the reasons.
In
a
sense,
the
court
finds
that
approach
to
the
review of cases of greater assistance to the court, as set out by the Crown, if
the court is inclined to impose a consecutive rather than a concurrent
sentence, albeit adjusted for
totality.
Consecutive
versus
concurrent
sentences:
As a result,
the court will first deal with the preliminary issue as to whether the
sentences should
be
or
could
be
concurrent,
or
whether
they need to be consecutive sentences for
the drug offences and the possession of the firearm, together with the firearm
prohibition charge.
On this point,
one of the cases cited by the defence was
R. v. Delchev
,
2014 ONCA 488
,
at paras.
33
to
35
.
In
that
case
the
court
noted
that it was a matter of discretion by the sentencing judge and that the judge
had found that the firearm was not a tool of the trade. The court would note
that this case preceded a number
of
subsequent
Court
of
Appeal
cases
below, which the court is going to refer
to and follow.
In
R.
v.
Crevier,
2015
ONCA
619
,
the
court
found that gun offences and drug offences
have different legally protected interests, and as a result, that the sentences
for these types of offences should be consecutive.
The court considered the serious safety concerns surrounding
the
possession
of
a
firearm
alongside illicit drugs.
The
court also relied upon the principles set out by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario in
R. v. Wong
,
2012 ONCA 767
, particularly at paras. 11 and 13.
In
R. v.
Wisdom
,
2024 ONSC 4047
, the court considered the issue at paras. 34 and 35.
The court considered
R. v. Crevier
and
also
R. v. Mar
,
[2018] O.J. No. 270, at para. 27
, together with
R. v.
Graham
,
2018 ONSC 6817
, at para.
43
, which was affirmed at the Ontario
Court of Appeal,
2020
ONCA
692
,
together
with
R.
v.
Owusu
,
2024 ONSC 671
, at paras.
24 to 25
.
As
Justice Code noted, the issue had long been decided that the s. 95 firearm
sentence and drug trafficking offences
should
be
served
consecutively,
and
that this
triggers the totality principle: see s. 718.2(c)
and
R.
v.
Chisholm
,
1965 CanLII 211 (ON CA)
, [1965]
4
C.C.C.
289
,
at p. 291.
Similarly, the court in
Wisdom
also found,
at
para.
36,
that
sentences
for
violations of s. 109
weapons prohibition orders should also be dealt with by way of consecutive
sentences, which also triggers the totality principle.
The court in
Wisdom
, at para.
59
, set out two alternate
ways in which to apply the totality principle in that case.
The court preferred the Crown’s approach
to determining a total sentence based
on
consecutive
components
of
the
individual
sentences,
then
reducing
it
in
light
of
totality, to
lead
to
a
sentence
which
reflected
the
overall culpability of the offender.
Most recently,
in
R. v. England
,
2024 ONCA 360
, the court considered both conviction
and sentence.
In the sentence appeal,
the court considered
specific
grounds
of
appeal
this
court
will not refer to in the reasons.
However,
the court did consider the fitness of sentence, and in
so
doing,
the
court
referred,
at
para.
98,
to
R.
v.
Parranto
and
the
hard
drugs
such
as
heroin and cocaine which cause death,
destruction and havoc, and that significant penitentiary sentences are
regularly imposed on those who traffic
in
large
quantities
of
them
even
if
they
are less deadly than fentanyl.
The
court considered
R.
v.
Lynch
,
2022
ONCA
109
,
at
paras.
14 to 15 and 24 to 26
, that
fentanyl is more dangerous than cocaine and that long or longer sentences
should be imposed in those cases.
The
court also noted that the appropriate range for mid-level
traffickers
in
cocaine
is
five
to
eight
years.
The sentence should be greater
for fentanyl.
There is no fentanyl in
the case at bar.
The
court
also
considered
R.
v.
Owusu
,
2024 ONSC 671
, at paras.
37 to 38
, an accused in possession of
127 grams of fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking was described as a “mid- level
trafficker” to whom a range of up to 10 years, for that offence alone, was
appropriate. The Court of Appeal approved the trial judge’s imposition of the
sentences as consecutive, then deducted a portion for totality.
This is consistent
with
the
earlier
approach
of
the
Court
of Appeal to consecutive treatment in
Crevier
.
While the
defence has submitted various cases which impose concurrent sentences, the
sentences did not really deal with the reasoning and rationale
for
imposing
the
sentences
in
that
way, in light of the appellate case law
setting out the principles that they should be consecutive. Accordingly,
the
court
found
the
defence
sentence cases,
most
of
which
are
set
out
below,
as
not
of
assistance to this court on the rationale as to whether to apply a consecutive
or concurrent sentence for the various offences in this case.
Accordingly,
this court agrees with Justice Code that
the
law
is
settled
at
the
appellate
level
in Ontario that sentences for drug
trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking offences should be
consecutive to sentences for possession
of
a
loaded
firearm
and
consecutive
to a sentence for breach of a s. 109
firearms prohibition order.
However, it is
important that where the court imposes
consecutive
sentences
for
these
offences, to consider the important
principle of totality. See
R. v. Wisdom
,
2024 ONSC 4047
and
R. v. England
,
2024
ONCA
369
.
Sentence for possession for
the purpose of trafficking in cocaine in the 978.96 gram range (which
is
just
under
1000
grams
or
just
under
one kilo of cocaine):
Before
reviewing the cases submitted by counsel, it
is
noteworthy
to
recall
past
guiding
judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada
in relation to trafficking and possession for the purpose of trafficking,
particularly
in
relation
to
Schedule
I drugs.
It is also significant to
consider the type of trafficker Mr. Sacchetti was in this case.
The Crown takes the position that he was
not a low-level trafficker.
The
defence agrees that he was not an addict trafficker.
The Crown submitted at one point that he was a large-scale
trafficker, although at one point appeared to back down to the point where he
may be somewhat less than that.
This
court would note that Mr. Sacchetti
was
a
mid-level
trafficker
given
all
of the circumstances of the facts in this
case, which the court has considered very carefully. This includes the
quantities, the types of drugs and the vast choices of drugs that he had, and
the other materials that he possessed for the purpose
of
trafficking.
The
court
also
considers
the quantities as significant.
Courts have
renewed emphasis on deterrent sentences
for
drug
trafficking-related
offences. Courts are eminently aware of
the dangers posed to society by drug crime and the importance of deterrent
sentences for drug traffickers.
In
R.
v.
Smith
,
(1987)
1987 CanLII 64 (SCC)
, 34
C.C.C.
(3d)
97
(S.C.C.)
,
Lamer,
J.
noted:
“Those
who
import
and
market
hard
drugs
for
lucre are responsible for the gradual but inexorable degeneration of many of
their fellow human beings as a result of their becoming drug addicts...such
persons, with few
exceptions...should,
upon
conviction,
in my respectful view, be sentenced to and
actually serve long periods of penal
servitude.”
The Supreme Court of Canada further
considered drug
offences
in
Pushpanathan
v.
Canada
(
Minister of
Citizenship
and
Immigration)
,
[1998]
1.
S.C.R. 982 (S.C.C.).
Cory, J. wrote of the social and economic
costs of illicit drug use in Canada and stated at pages 1039 to 1040:
“The costs to society of drug
abuse and trafficking in illicit drugs are at least significant
if
not
staggering.
These
include direct
costs such as healthcare and law enforcement, and indirect costs of lost
productivity.
In Canada, the total cost to
society of substance
abuse
has
been
estimated
to
be $18.45 billion
annually (Canadian Centre on Substance
Abuse,
The
Costs
of
Substance
Abuse in Canada:
Highlights
(1996), at p. 2).
Of this amount,
the cost flowing from illicit drugs is $1.4 billion (McKenzie & Single). In
1992 there were 732 deaths, 7,095 hospitalizations and 58,571 hospital days in
Canada attributable to illicit drugs (McKenzie & Single).
Mortality from illicit drugs is less than
for alcohol and tobacco, but tends to involve younger victims (
Costs of
Substance
Abuse
in
Canada,
supra
,
at
p.6).
These significant and often
tragic consequences
serve
to
emphasize
that
the
harm caused by trafficking in illicit
drugs is very properly a matter of grave concern in Canada, as it is throughout
the world.”
The
court
would
note
that
that
case
was
in
1998,
27
years
ago.
Subsequently,
as
noted
by
the
Supreme
Court
of Canada
in
R.
v.
Pearson
,
(1992)
1992 CanLII 52 (SCC)
, 77
C.C.C.
(3d) 124, the court stated:
“Drugs are responsible for 70 to
80 percent of prison terms: crimes resulting from the application of narcotics
legislation (possession and trafficking); crimes committed
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and other drugs (rape, violence and
homicide); crimes committed to obtain drugs (theft and
prostitution).”
In the context
of its consideration of the bail provisions
relating
to
trafficking
in
narcotics,
the Supreme Court noted:
“Most offences are not
committed systematically.
By
contrast, trafficking in narcotics occurs systematically, usually within a
highly sophisticated commercial setting.
It
is
often
a
business
and
a
way
of
life.
It is highly lucrative,
creating huge incentives for an offender to continue criminal behaviour.”
More recently,
in 2021, 23 years after
Pushpanathan
,
the
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
again considered the dangers posed by
trafficking in hard drugs and the impact it has in Canada, in
R.
v.
Parranto
,
2021 SCC 24 (CanLII)
, 2021
S.C.C.
24,
at
paras.
87
to 89
, stating as follows:
“[87] The dangers posed by
trafficking in hard
drugs,
such
as
heroin
and
cocaine,
have long been recognized in Canada.
Over
the past few decades, however, society’s awareness of the true gravity of
trafficking in such drugs has grown to the point that we are
reminded,
on
a
daily
basis,
of
the
death,
destruction, and havoc it causes in communities across Canada.
[88]
Trafficking in such substances causes both direct and
indirect harms to society. Directly,
the
distribution
and
abuse
of
hard
drugs leads to addiction, debilitating adverse health effects, and, all too
frequently,
death
by
overdose.
As
Lamer,
J. (as he then was) astutely observed,
where addiction
and
death
occur
-
as
they
so
often
do - those who oversee the distribution of these drugs
are personally ‘responsible for the gradual but
inexorable degeneration of many of their fellow human beings.’ (

Trafficking also leads indirectly to
a host of other ills, including an increase in all manner of crime, committed
by those seeking to finance their addiction, as well as by organized crime
syndicates

Given that much of this criminal activity is violent,
trafficking has come to be understood as an offence of violence, even beyond
the ruinous consequences it has for those who abuse drugs and in the process,
destroy themselves and others.”
Appellate
courts have spoken often about the principles as related to trafficking and
trafficking-related offences.
Deterrence
and denunciation
are
clearly
the
primary
principles.
As
it
relates
to
cocaine,
in
R.
v.
Bajada
,
2003 CanLII 15687 (ON CA)

Sentencing

ed.(Toronto:

Clayton
C.
Ruby
states
under
the
heading
“Cocaine” at p. 865-866:
“Cocaine
used
to
be
regarded
by
the
courts
as
a drug which is somewhat more serious than marijuana but less serious than
heroin. However, due to the existence of crack cocaine and intravenous cocaine
users, this attitude seems to be changing.
More
recent sentences
for
cocaine
seem
on
par
with
those imposed for heroin possession or
trafficking.”

In this case,
there were additional facts read into the record to be considered on sentence
for the possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine.
More
particularly,
the
facts
related
to possession by Mr. Sacchetti of 286.43 grams of methamphetamine and
118.76 grams and 16.44 grams of heroin and tramadol.
It is
important to note the qualities of the other
Schedule
I
drugs
to
truly
appreciate
the nature of the substances and the
severity of offences
related
to
trafficking
and
possession
for the purpose of trafficking in those other substances.
As
courts
have
indicated
over
the
years, methamphetamine is highly addictive.
In
R.
v.
Holt,
(1983)
1983 CanLII 3521 (ON CA)
,
4
C.C.C.
(3d)

(Ont

,
which was affirmed at the Supreme
Court of Canada,

C.C.C.

the
court
referred
to
R.
v.
Ward,
(1980)

,
56
C.C.C.
(2d)
15
,
at
p
18
.
In
that
judgment,
Martin
J.A.,
speaking
for
the
court,
recognized
methamphetamine
as
one
of
the
more dangerous drugs, stating:
“The principle has been clearly
expressed by this court on many occasions, and by other appellate courts in
Canada that, save in exceptional circumstances, a custodial sentence is
required to be imposed following a conviction for trafficking in the more
dangerous drugs, of which methamphetamine is one.
We are of the view that there were, at the time of sentencing,
no exceptional circumstances which justified a departure from that principle in
the present case, having regard to the nature of the drug, the quantity
involved and the obvious commercial nature
of
the
transaction.
The
fact
that
the
offender
had,
during
the
interval
between
the commission of the
offence and his trial, rid himself of his drug dependency, was a mitigating
circumstance but not an exceptional circumstance, nor was the fact that
he
was
at
the
time
of
sentence
gainfully employed an exceptional circumstance, although it was a factor
which was entitled due weight.”
Over the
years, methamphetamine has been moved from
the
less
serious
Schedule
III,
to
the
more
serious Schedule I of the
CDSA
.
As a result,
the offence is now subject to the more
serious
punishment
of
life
imprisonment.
In other words, Parliament has reflected its view that
methamphetamine is even more serious than was
recognized
by
the
Court
of
Appeal
for
Ontario
in
Holt
and
Ward
,
when
the
maximum
punishment
was only 10 years
imprisonment.
Heroin has
long been recognized as a highly addictive and serious drug, and trafficking in
this
Schedule
I
substance
has
been
found
time
and time again to be
deserving of very serious jail sentences, and for trafficking sentences in the
penitentiary range.
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
also
in
possession
of
GHB,
over 4000 grams in quantity.
The nature of this drug has also been
commented upon in judgments in the past, again more often in cases related to
possession for the purpose of trafficking and trafficking of the drug.
In
R. v. Paper,
2010 ONCJ 88 (CanLII)
, [2010] O.J.
No.
1131,
which
was
affirmed
at
the
Court
of Appeal,
2011 ONCA 56 (CanLII)
, [2011] O.J. No. 261 (C.A.), it was noted that GHB is a
central nervous system depressant that makes the person sleepy, slows down
breathing and heart rate.
It is made
in illicit laboratories.
It is
usually sold as a liquid in small vials.
It
can be slipped into drinks and its sedative effects can prevent victims from
resisting sexual assault.
It can also
cause amnesia.
GHB has gained
popularity as a club drug among young people for its euphoric and sedative
effects.
There is only a slight
difference between a dose which produces the desired effects and one which puts
the user at risk.
It is a potent
sedative which can cause users to fall into a deep coma-like sleep for several
hours.
Convulsions can occur during
the sleep.
Users
may
vomit
while
sleeping
and
choke.
In
addition,
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
also
in
possession
of 1273.38 grams of oxycodone.
Oxycodone
is one of
the
most
serious
and
addictive
of
drugs,
being a
Schedule
I
drug,
s.
1(29)
of
the
Schedule.
The range of
penalty for this offence is also life imprisonment.
It
is
a
drug
which
has
become
much more common over the last two
decades, and this court, as a frontline court dealing with drug cases in
Toronto, has seen time and time again the
ills
it
causes
in
peoples’
lives,
parallel
to what has been
stated by the Supreme Court of Canada for other Schedule I drugs.
The problem with oxycodone is that the
users often start by taking
it
for
pain,
often
caused
by
injuries,
and migrate into becoming users of street-level oxycodone and
other Schedule I drugs. Ironically, it could be said that is what happened to
Mr. Sacchetti, although it is not entirely
clear
on
the
record
before
this
court.
Nonetheless,
of
all
people,
Mr.
Sacchetti
would
have
known
the
addictive
nature
of
this
drug
and
how its users can often migrate to take other more dangerous Schedule I drugs.
Further, the
court has a significant concern about anyone who possesses many types of drugs
across
the
spectrum
available
for
trafficking.
In this case, the choices of
types of drugs, as listed
above,
and
also
included
marijuana,
ranges across the
spectrum of less to much more serious types of drugs that someone might want to
access and acquire from Mr. Sacchetti.
It
was, to use an expression, “a drug boutique in a car”.
As noted
in
R.
v.
Paper
,
at
para.
33,
which
judgment was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal:
“This court has a concern when
a person sets up a commercial operation which caters to a wide
variety
of
drug
tastes,
as
Ms.
Paper
did in this case.
It exposes a potential customer who might have just wanted the
less serious drugs, such as marijuana, to a huge selection of other drugs they
might be tempted to try for the sake of variety, or for a more adventurous
experience.
As noted elsewhere in
this judgment, some of the choices offered by Ms. Paper in her ‘drug boutique’
were of highly addictive and dangerous substances.”
This case
reflects Mr. Sacchetti as a mid-level trafficker who was engaged in possession
for the purpose of trafficking in multiple Schedule I drugs, which he kept in
his vehicle as a storage place
for
a
vast
selection
of
choices
of
Schedule
I and other drugs.
Relating to
this charge, counsel have focused their
research
on
cocaine,
even
though
the
facts
read in relate to the far more aggravating situation of the other drugs,
including the Schedule
I
drugs
which
the
court
has
referred
to
above.
The
court
considers
R.
v.
Bajada
,
2003 CanLII 15687 (ON CA)
, [2003]
O.J.
No. 721 (C.A.).
The accused had three prior drug
trafficking-related convictions on his record.  The
quantity
of
cocaine
involved
was
in
excess
of
500
grams of cocaine, which is half a kilo of cocaine.
The court held that sentences of five to five and one-half years
are not uncommon for possession
of
a
substantial
amount
of
cocaine
for the
purpose
of
trafficking
following
an
accused’s plea of
guilt or where the accused has no prior record.
The sentence in that case was upheld. That was 22 years ago.
In
R. v.
Bryan
,
2011 ONCA 273
, the court stated the
normal
range
for
sentence
to
be
five
to
eight years’
incarceration
for
someone
without
a
record convicted of possession for the
purpose of trafficking in slightly more than a pound of cocaine, which would be
slightly more than 454 grams of cocaine.
In
R. v.
Amante
,
2016 ONCA 18
, the court held that a sentence of seven years’
incarceration fell
within
the
appropriate
range
for
an
offender
who had in the year prior to the subject offence served six months in jail for
drug dealing, and where
the
subject
charge
related
to
one
kilogram of cocaine.
In
R. v.
Wawrykiewicz
,
2019 ONCA 21
, the court considered
on
a
sentence
appeal
approximately
1.8 kilos of cocaine.
The court affirmed
Bryan
, noting
that a five to eight year incarceration sentence is appropriate for first
offenders possessing
slightly
more
than
a
pound
of
cocaine,
which is 454 grams.
He also had been
in possession of heroin and phenacetin, a cutting agent.
He had no prior record but was on bail for similar offences.
The overall sentence in that
case
of
10
years
was
upheld
on
appeal.
That is an important Court of Appeal case,
and the court would note that Mr. Sacchetti had a recent related
conviction
for
possession
for
the
purpose of trafficking shortly before
this offence, and that he was in possession of far more types of Schedule I
drugs.
The defence
referred to the case of
R. v. Lynch
,
2022 ONCA 109
, a Crown appeal where
four years had been imposed for possession for the purpose of trafficking in
cocaine, fentanyl and possession
of
proceeds
of
crime.
The
quantity
of drugs in that case included 965.01
grams of cocaine, 149.28 grams of MDMA and 41.37 grams of fentanyl.
The sentence in that case was increased,
on the Crown appeal, to six years’ jail.
The
court
found
that
the
range
of
sentence
for
mid-level
traffickers
of
cocaine
to
be
in
the range
of
five
to
eight
years,
as
per
R.
v.
Maone
,
2020 ONCA 461
.
Fentanyl is more serious than cocaine.
The court also relied on
R. v. Olvedi
,
2021 ONCA 518
, to find that sentencing for the purpose of trafficking in
fentanyl should be as long or longer than for possession for the purpose of
trafficking in cocaine, and as a result,
a
sentence
of
six
years’
jail
was
imposed
in that case.
The
court
has
also
considered
the
cases
submitted by the defence at the sentencing
decision level rather than the Court of Appeal.
In that regard the court has considered the following cases. In
R.
v. Llanos,
2025 ONSC 3986
, the defendant was
found
guilty
of
possession
for
the
purpose
of trafficking in cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine, together with
possession of brass knuckles.
There
was no firearm offence in that case.
The
defence sought
Duncan
credit for harsh presentence custody conditions.
He had a prior criminal record.
Counsel agreed that the appropriate range
of sentence for the drug offences was four to eight years’ jail.
The court considered the unique
circumstances of the offender at pages 9 to 10.
A sentence of five and a half years’ jail was imposed after
consideration of presentence custody credit.
In
R.
v.
Llanos
,
the
court
also
considered
within
it
R.
v.
Moore
,
2025
ONCA
47
,
which
involved
29.67 grams of fentanyl.
Although
there was a history
of
drug
addiction,
the
motivation
for
the
offence was financial.
A sentence of
five years less
five
months
presentence
custody
was
imposed.
The court also
considered the
Moore
case.
The court would note, however, that it was a very brief
three-page endorsement by the Court of Appeal for fentanyl for the purpose of
trafficking, with no firearms charges.
A
sentence of five years less five months presentence custody credit was upheld.
In
R. v.
Shaikh and Tanoli
,
2024 ONSC 774
, the court considered a case where the
defendant entered a guilty plea to trafficking cocaine to an undercover officer
on February 1 of 2022 and again on February 22 of 2022.
As part of the agreed facts, it was admitted that these two
transactions were part of a course of conduct that
went
on
for
five
months
during
an
undercover investigation, during which
the undercover officer made five separate drug purchases.
On February 1, 2022, the officer purchased
two ounces of cocaine for $3,200, and on February 22nd he purchased nine ounces
for $13,500.
The court considered the
Duncan
credit for the adverse
conditions
at
the
Toronto
South
Detention Centre.
The court also made reference to the
credit
in
the
R.
v.
Marshall
case,
2021
ONCA
344
. The court also considered
R. v.
Bernard
,
2021 ONSC 5817
.
The
guilty plea was an important mitigating factor related to the trial time that
it saved the court.
The court
considered the harsh conditions in the jail in that case and in other cases
considered.
The court in that case,
rather than following the
Marshall
approach, deducted
a
further
.5
days
credit
for
each
day
of
presentence custody credit.
There
were deductions from the consecutive sentences pursuant to
Duncan
credit
and further
Summers
credit
and
further
credit
for
totality,
resulting in
a
sentence
of
774
days,
which
is
approximately
25.4 months’ jail for one
accused, and three years
and
one
and
a
half
months
for
the
other
accused.
The court has
also considered the important principle of totality, as this sentence of
possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine
will
be
a
sentence
that
will
be
imposed
with
two
additional
consecutive
jail
sentences.
It will not be a global sentence.
Overall, this
court finds that the appropriate range for sentence for the possession for the
purpose
of
trafficking
in
cocaine
in
the
amount of 978.96 grams, where the accused has a prior conviction
for a similar offence, and where he also had possession of 4075.16 grams of
GHB, 286.43
grams
of
methamphetamine,
and
16.44
grams of heroin, together with 248.41
grams of phenacetin, which is a cutting agent, together with very substantial
quantities of Canadian currency, all of which place him in the category of a
mid-range trafficker, bearing in mind the principle of totality for consecutive
sentences and
restraint
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
will
be Mr. Sacchetti’s first jail sentence in a penitentiary, those are all factors
which the court considers.
Without
totality, the court would
be
of
the
view
that
a
sentence
in
the
range of seven years’ incarceration is
appropriate for this offence given all the aggravating circumstances.
However, it is important to consider, and
the court applies a reduction to allow for the principle of totality and the
mitigating factors as set out above.  Accordingly, the court imposes a sentence
of six years’
incarceration
for
that
offence.
From
that sentence, the court
will deduct enhanced presentence custody credit, which will be noted
below.
Sentence
-
possession
of
a
loaded
restricted firearm, a handgun;
The
court
has
considered
the
seminal
case
of
R. v. Nur
,
2015 SCC 15 (CanLII)
, 2015 S.C.C. 15.
The
court considered the nature of true crime guns.
The court held that there are guns used as a tool of the
criminal trade or by those engaged in criminal conduct
or
conduct
that
poses
a
danger
to
others.
The court held that for this type of offence there should be significant
penitentiary sentences.
On a first
conviction a sentence of three
to
five
years
was
considered
appropriate. While there is no issue in
this case that Mr. Sacchetti possessed the firearm for his work in the
drug
trade,
the
court
also
considers
comments made in other cases.
In
R. v. Williams
,
2007 CarswellOnt
2074
, the court noted that the combination
of
illegal
firearms
and
illicit
drugs creates
a
highly
dangerous
and
volatile
situation with the potential for serious, even fatal, consequences.
It
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
firearm was possessed for no legitimate purpose, and
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
it
was
intended
for protection, intimidation or violence.
See also
R. v. Mansingh
,
2016 ONSC 94
, where the court
noted that people who carry handguns while selling
drugs
create
a
significant
nuisance
and extreme danger for people in the area.
In
R.
v.
Marshall
,
2025
ONCA
692
,
the
court
found that for a youthful offender with no record, a sentence
of
three
and
a
half
years
for
possession
of a firearm while engaged in drug trafficking, after a trial, was fit.
That sentence was
upheld.
In
R. v.
Abdullahi
,
2015 ONCA 549
, the court considered
sentence
on
an
appeal
after
a
trial. A
four
year
sentence
was
found
to
be
appropriate, although there were other
firearm offences.
In
R.
v.
Patel
,
2019
ONSC
6302
,
the
court
considered
the
sentence
for
a
young
offender
with a record and no exceptional
mitigating circumstances.
The court
held that a three year sentence was appropriate, together with a one year
consecutive sentence for possession of that firearm contrary to the weapons
prohibition
order.
In
R. v.
Griffith
,
2019 ONSC 358
, the court imposed a four year sentence for
possession of the firearm in what was a true crime context as he
was
engaged
in
a
drug
transaction
at
the
time. He
was
also
sentenced
to
one
year
consecutive
for being in possession of that firearm
contrary to the weapons prohibition order.
The
drug trafficking offence was consecutive to that sentence, albeit a far less
serious drug charge than in the case at bar.
Most
of
the
cases
on
this
point
submitted
by
the defence were from the trial decision
level.
In
R. v.
Aguiar
,
2024 ONSC 3372
, the court considered a case where there was a
guilty plea to two counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking
in
cocaine,
possession
of
a
firearm, a
Glock
handgun,
contrary
to
s.
92(1).
A
search of the vehicle of the accused led
to a hidden trap compartment in the trunk that contained 687.3
grams
of
cocaine,
1421
grams
of
fentanyl,
567.9 grams of methamphetamine,
ammunition for various
firearms,
a
digital
scale,
plastic
wrap packaging with
cocaine residue, and a hydraulic press used to press drugs.
In a second vehicle for the accused, in
hidden trap compartments, police
located
a
.40
calibre
Glock
handgun,
which was a prohibited firearm, and
ammunition, 8.4 grams of fentanyl, 584 grams of methamphetamine, 722 Xanax
pills, a digital scale, a handgun holster, cell phones, and $31 U.S. currency
and $5 Canadian currency.
In a dated
record, the relevant
prior
entry
was
for
simple
possession
of a controlled substance and a $500 fine in 2008.  The accused
in that case, however, had an unfortunate and difficult childhood, and
reference letters spoke well of his character. He was offered employment as a
labourer in construction.
He had
served 397 real days of presentence custody.
An agreed-upon enhanced presentence
custody
amount
was
calculated
in
the
range of 794 days.
There was a very
unique circumstance in that case, which is entirely unlike
the
one
at
bar.
In
that
case,
the
police had intercepted many times the
conversations between the accused and his lawyer, contrary to the wiretap
authorization and contrary to the law, including s. 8 of the
Charter
.
The judge was
of
the
view
that
without
the
solicitor/client privilege
issue, the appropriate sentence would have been in the range of five to eight
years in the
penitentiary
for
the
cocaine
offences
and
two to
three
years
for
the
gun
conviction.
The
judge
was of the view, however, that the sentences could be concurrent, as they were
found in different
vehicles,
and
there
was
no
evidence
the handgun was a tool of the trade in the narcotics trafficking
business.
The court would note at
this point that it is quite different from the case
at
bar,
where
there
was
only
one
vehicle
and the accused was in it.
There
was also not a situation where he used the firearm as a tool of the trade in
drug trafficking.
The judge found
that it was a relatively sophisticated mid-level trafficking operation.
There was the dangerous toxic combination
of drugs and a firearm.
(See
Parranto
para. 87 and following.)
The
offences were motivated by financial greed, as there was no evidence that the
accused suffered from an addiction.
The
court found that there were significant mitigating issues, which are not
present
in
the
case
at
bar,
as
indicated,
related to the
Charter
and
solicitor/client issue.
In the end,
the court found that the appropriate sentence
was
one
of
five
years’
imprisonment
on
a global basis, less presentence custody
credit.
The
court
did
not
impose
a
conditional
sentence.
Are
court
staff
okay
or
do
you
want
a
personal
break?
GIOVANNI
SACCHETTI:
I
could
use
–
I
could
use
the washroom, Your Honour.
THE
COURT:
Do
you
want
to
use
the
washroom?
GIOVANNI
SACCHETTI
:
Yeah.
THE
COURT:
That’s
fine.
Officer,
can
you
take him
out
to
use
the
washroom
and
then
come
back,
please.
I’ll be here.

PAUSE
IN
THE
PROCEEDINGS
In
R.
v.
Collins
,
2023
ONSC
5768
,
the
court
dealt with trafficking in cocaine between March 20th and April 22nd of
2020; possession of a loaded prohibited firearm on September 9th of 2020;
possession of a loaded prohibited firearm on September 9th of 2020, contrary to
a s. 109 order; possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking on
September 9th of 2020; and possession of proceeds of crime on September 9th of
2020.
The defence sought a reduction
of sentence in relation to
Charter
violations.
The accused had a highly unique and unfortunate series of
experiences as a young man.
He was 13
years
old
when
his
birth
mother
was
murdered,
and her
dismembered
body
was
found
three
years
later.
A
year
later,
when
he
was
14,
his
best
friend
was shot and killed.
He had a lengthy criminal record,
including a prior for possession for the purpose
of
trafficking
in
relation
to
cocaine
and fentanyl.
He was also the victim of a shooting. There were other unique
circumstances related to the offender outlined in the facts of that case. The
Crown sought a lenient sentence of three to five years given all the unique
facts in that case, rather than six to eight years in the penitentiary.
The court did not find that case to be of
assistance to this court given all the unique and extenuating exceptional
circumstances in that case.
In
R. v.
Gurhan
,
2024 ONSC 5562
, sentence was imposed after a trial where the
defendant was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking in
cocaine, possession of Percocets, possession of proceeds of crime over $5,000,
and possession
of
a
loaded
prohibited
firearm.
Other
firearm-related offences were stayed.
The
defendant
was
found
in
a
room
in
a
residence
with three other males, and he had keys to a vehicle he
operated the day before, which was found to contain 64.55 grams of cocaine,
240.68 grams of crack cocaine, and a loaded 9mm handgun.
The estimated street value of the drugs was between $29,000 and
$54,500.
In the room at the residence
was a scale, cell phones and cash totaling
$8,060.
The
defendant
was
21
years
old
at the time of the offences, and at the time of sentence he was 24 years old
and had no prior criminal record.
He
was not a drug user.
He traveled to
Thunder Bay to commit the offences, for reasons not known to the court.
The court referred to the problem of
offenders coming to Thunder Bay and committing similar offences, where there
are vulnerable Indigenous people.  The handgun was a tool of the trade of drug
trafficking.
He helped his
grandmother a great deal and had supportive letters from family members.
He was enrolled in a college program for a
future career and appeared to have good rehabilitative
prospects,
particularly
as
a
young person.
The Crown sought a five year sentence less presentence custody
credit.
The defence sought a sentence
of three and a half to four years less credit for restrictive bail conditions.
The
court
considered
R.
v.
Nur
and
R. v. Mohiadin
,
2021 ONCA 122
, which quoted from
Nur.
In reasons that were not very
extensive, the
court
imposed
a
global
sentence
of
four
and
a
half years less
Downes
credit for a restrictive bail.
The defendant was clearly very young, and
the court finds that there are notable distinguishing factors in that case
related to the offender, as compared to the case at bar.
In
R. v.
Marshall
,
2021 ONCA 344
, Doherty J.A. wrote the judgment for the court.
The court considered
two
sentences
imposed
by
two
different judges
for
this
accused.
At
one
point
he
entered a guilty plea to
two charges of possession of a sawed-off semiautomatic shotgun and possession
and unsafe storage of the ammunition that could not be used in the shotgun.
He was under a weapons
prohibition
order
at
the
time.
The
court
carefully reviewed the concept of
Duncan
credit. The court has carefully
reviewed this case and not found it to be of great assistance to this case,
other than for its general principles and for the enhanced presentence custody
credit
consideration.
This court has
also carefully considered the judgment of
R. v. Stephens
,
2024 ONCA 793
,
although
it
is
not
summarizing
it
at
this
point.
In
R. v.
Stewart
,
2024 ONSC 281
, the court considered
a
case
where
the
defendant
had
entered a guilty plea to
possession of fentanyl and a loaded prohibited handgun, and the defendant was a
young black man.
An enhanced
presentence report
was
prepared.
No
portion
of
this
case
was
highlighted, but the court has considered the case and the comments in it.
In
R. v.
Thompson
,
2025 ONSC 2768
, the court considered a sentence where there had
been a guilty plea to trafficking in cocaine, three transactions of 2.1 grams,
5.81 grams and 2.53 grams, possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine
and possession of a loaded restricted firearm.
A search of the bedroom of his residence
led
to
the
discovery
of
124.76
grams
of cocaine, 27.1 grams of MDMA, 122.89 grams of phenacetin, which is a
cutting agent, $700 in cash, and a Glock 27 .40 calibre semiautomatic handgun
with
eight
rounds
in
the
magazine
and
one round in the chamber.
There was also a detachable box cartridge magazine
loaded with 14 rounds of .40 calibre ammunition, 63 rounds of ammunition of
various calibres, including .40 calibre
ammunition,
and
three
functioning
digital scales.
At the
time of the offences, the offender was 21 years of age and 24 years of age at
the time of sentence.
He had no prior
criminal
record
and
a
promising
future
as
a
young
person in basketball, but he had encountered challenges
and
difficulties
in
the
school
system.  He explained that he had the firearm for protection in the drug
trade.
His personal circumstances,
which included favourable circumstances, were outlined in detail and considered
by the court in the reasons.
The
Crown sought a five year sentence for totality, and the defence sought two
years less a day on a conditional sentence.
The
court specifically noted the Court of Appeal has recognized “denunciation and
deterrence assume places of prominence in determining a fit sentence for crimes
involving firearms, especially loaded semiautomatic firearms in the possession
of drug traffickers”:
R. v.
Mohammed
,
2017 ONCA 691
, at para.
6
.
He
had genuine remorse and had made strides
towards
his
rehabilitation.
He
had
spent almost
a
year
on
restrictive
bail.
The
court
was of the view that the shortest possible sentence that could achieve
denunciation and deterrence was one of 30 months’ jail less presentence custody
credit in that case.
The
court
also
considered
the
more
dated
Court
of Appeal case in
R.
v. Wong
,
2012 ONCA 767
.
This
court would note that sentence ranges have evolved in a significant way in the
last 13 years, and as a result, this case is of less assistance to the court.
The
court
has
carefully
reviewed
R.
v.
Banks
,
a 2025 judgment referred to by the defence.
The court is of the view that this
sentence by a trial judge is not in keeping with the proper range of sentence
for this type of offence, particularly
given
the
quantity
of
cocaine,
the 98
percent
purity
of
the
cocaine,
the
$30,000
of monies that were seized.
The court finds that the sentence imposed
in that case is not one which this court will or should follow.
It is simply
not
in
keeping
with
the
law,
particularly
at the appellate level.
The court
agrees, considering all of the circumstances, that the firearm was in a car,
that
there
was
the
extensive
amount
of
ammunition in the magazine and the spent
cartridge in the vehicle,
that
a
sentence
of
four
years
would
have been appropriate
for this offence, consecutive. However,
the
court
is
mindful
of
the
principle
of totality, together with restraint for the first penitentiary
sentence and the other mitigating factors in this case.
This was, for
Mr. Sacchetti, a first conviction for a firearm or weapons offence.
Accordingly, the
court
finds
that
a
reduced
sentence
of
three years’ incarceration is
appropriate, to be consecutive to possession for the purpose of trafficking in
cocaine.
As noted earlier, the court
is going to be deducting enhanced presentence custody credit from part of the
sentence in this case.
Sentence
-
breach
of
s.
109
weapons
prohibition order:
As
it
relates
to
the
sentence
for
breach
of
the
s.
109
prohibition
order,
the
court
considers
the following:
In
addition
to
the
cases
noted
above, which are
considered, the Crown has submitted that a sentence of one year consecutive is
appropriate,
and
the
defence
has
submitted
that
a
sentence of six months’ consecutive is
appropriate.
While
the
Court
of
Appeal
for
Ontario
held
in
R.
v.
McCue
,
2012
ONCA
773
,
that
a
sentence
for
a
weapons prohibition breach can be consecutive or an aggravating circumstance,
where there is also a possession of a firearm charge, that principle
subsequently evolved.
In
R. v.
Johnson
,
2013 ONCA 177
and
R. v. Chambers
,
2013 ONCA 680
and
R.
v. Claros
,
2019 ONCA 626
, the court held that sentences
for
weapons
prohibition
breaches
should be
consecutive.
Where consecutive
sentences are imposed, however, the court must be mindful of the principle of
totality, either by reducing individual sentences for each of the consecutive
components of sentence for the offences, or by reducing a total global sentence
based upon that
principle.
In
R. v.
Sitladeen
,
2024 ONSC 4244
, the court stated that the sentence range for
weapons prohibition
breaches
ranges
from
six
months
to two years consecutive.
In
all
the
circumstances,
including
consideration
for
totality
and
restraint
for
the
first
sentence
in
the
penitentiary,
for
this
to
be
a
consecutive sentence to the other
sentences, the court finds that the appropriate sentence in this case for this
offence is one of one year consecutive, in light of the range which has emerged
from the case law, and also taking into account totality and the factors in
mitigation.
The court
would note that applying these three sentences together, this would give rise
to a sentence of 10 years’ incarceration, less presentence
custody
credit.
The
court
has
within its consideration of the various
components to the sentence considered all of the sentencing principles noted
above, including mitigation for the guilty plea on the first day of the
preliminary hearing the aggravating factors of the additional drugs possessed,
the substantial amount
of
proceeds
of
crime
of
$2,910
and
$7,180,
the type of trafficker that Mr. Sacchetti was, not
being
a
low-level
trafficker
but
being
a
mid- level trafficker, also considering
that he possessed
a
portion
of
the
drugs
for
his
own
use, that the firearm was in a vehicle,
and the spent casing
in
the
vehicle,
together
with
the
extended handgun magazine capable of
holding up to 31 rounds of ammunition, together with there being 142
rounds
of
ammunition,
are
all
considered
with respect to this matter.
As
indicated earlier, the court considered the principle of totality, given
the
various
offences
and
the
sentence
for each of
them, in coming to the individual
sentences.
Consideration
of
enhanced
presentence
custody
credit:
In
this
regard,
Mr.
Sacchetti
has
served
a
period
of
actual
days
of
presentence
custody
credit
from arrest
on
August
18th,
2024,
continuously
through to today, November 7th, 2025, of
447 days.
Summers
credit,
at
one
and
a
half
days
credit
for each of those days, would result in an enhanced credit of 671 days.
The defence
seeks further enhanced presentence custody credit arising from the evidence of
the harsh conditions of presentence custody as set out
in
all
the
materials
before
the
court,
and
as
well, the testimony of Mr. Sacchetti in court earlier today.
There is a contradiction in the evidence
before the court as to the number of lockdown days, whether full or partial.
The records kept by Mr. Sacchetti reflect
a higher number of those days over the period of time in which he kept those
records.
He did not start his records
until he had been in custody for several months.
And then, for the last several months, the court was advised
that his records were seized when the Toronto South Detention Centre went
through various cells a number of weeks
ago,
seizing
items
that
were
in
the
cells.
The Court of
Appeal in
Marshall
has suggested an approach to this crediting process
to move away from
a
technical
minute
mathematical
calculation. The court has considered that
very carefully.  However,
although
the
court
has
done
that
in
many other cases before the court, in a
case such as this one, where there are consecutive sentences, it
makes
it
very
challenging
to
apply
the
type
of principled approach that Justice
Doherty suggested, where the court has three separate consecutive
sentences,
such
as
what
is
before
the
court now, and considers them specifically for enhanced presentence custody
credit.  Accordingly,
the
court
is
not
going
to
follow,
in this one case, the approach suggested
by Justice Doherty, which this court greatly respects.
In this case,
the Crown and defence have agreed upon Mr. Sacchetti’s records being a
representative sample of the rate of having lockdown
days.
In
that
regard,
the
parties
have agreed that he has served a total of
partial or full lockdown days of 205 days that he was in custody.
The court accepts the position of counsel
on that.
As it relates
to enhanced presentence custody credit for the lockdown days, the court is
going to credit 0.5 days, in addition to the
Summers
credit,
for
those
days
in
which
there
are
partial or full lockdown days.
This would result in a further 103 days of
enhanced presentence custody credit.
The
court
does
disagree
with
the
defence submission that a further 0.5 days
credit should be given for days which are not lockdown days.
Mr.
Sacchetti
was
triple
bunked,
with
there
being three
inmates
in
his
cell,
from
April
22nd,
2025, to July 22nd, 2025, for a total of 18 days.  Then, from August
23rd, 2025, to September 1 of 2025, he was triple bunked in the cell for 10
days.
This
totals
28
days.
And
there
have
been no days of triple bunking since
September 1 of 2025.
In total then,
he was subject to triple bunking for 28 days.
As it relates
to the triple bunking, it is the view of this court, given the evidence in this
case, that it is particularly egregious.
As
the court
notes,
the
cells
were
made
for
two
inmates. Having one additional inmate
added to cells, lying on the floor or on a mattress on the floor next to the
toilet, is egregious, not only for that
third
inmate
on
the
floor,
but
the
other
two inmates who may try to negotiate or
have to use the toilet in the cell.
Accordingly,
although not submitted by counsel, the court is going to give a further 28 full
days enhanced presentence custody credit for each day of triple bunking.  The
corrections officials need to have a sufficient
number
of
cells
to
properly
house detainees and inmates.
This
would
result
in
Summers
credit
of
671
days, a
further
enhanced
presentence
custody
credit
of
103
days for lockdowns, and a further 28 days, full
days,
for
triple
bunking.
This
results
in
a total enhanced
presentence custody credit of 802
days.
The court is
going to deduct that from the sentence it would otherwise impose on the
possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine of six years.
Six years - and the parties can let me
know if my math is wrong - is 2,190 days.
The
court subtracts from that the enhanced presentence custody credit of 802 days,
and
this
would
result
in
a
sentence
of
1,388
days jail.
This is roughly equivalent to a sentence of three years, which
is 1,095 days, and 293 days, or three years and just under 10 months in jail.
That
is
reduced
from
the
six
year
sentence that he otherwise would have
been given.
The
sentence
for
possession
of
the
firearm
will remain at three years’ incarceration, to be consecutive, which is
1,095 days.
The sentence
for the breach of the weapons prohibition
order
of
one
year
incarceration,
consecutive, is a further 365 days.
This would
result in a total sentence of 1,388 days,
plus
1,095
days,
plus
365
days,
which
gives rise to a total of 2,848 days.
This
is
a
total
sentence
of
approximately
seven years, which is 2,555 days, and 293
days, or seven years and just under 10 months.
There
will
also
be
ancillary
orders.
There
will
be
a
s.
109
weapons
prohibition
order for life.
There
will
be
an
order
that
a
DNA
sample
be
taken
from the accused for each offence before the court, all of which are secondary
designated
offences.
There
is
also
going
to
be
an
order
of
forfeiture,
which the court will address in a moment.
The
court
is
also
going
to
make
a
recommendation
that Mr. Sacchetti receive any counseling for drug dependency as may be deemed
appropriate.
Now, on the
prohibition order, is what I’ve been handed,
Mr.
Forte,
which
is
the
draft
prohibition order, the subject of
agreement of the Crown and
defence?
M.
FORTE:
It
is.
THE COURT:
All right.
Accordingly, given that the parties have agreed with respect to
what should
be
forfeited
to
the
Crown
and
what
should be
returned
to
the
accused,
the
court
will
agree
to that and sign the order.
Accordingly,
the
following
items,
which
are
under category B, are offence-related
property which are subject to forfeiture pursuant to s. 490.1(1), and they
include the following:
The Glock .22
firearm, one round of 9mm ammunition, the over-capacity magazine, nine rounds
of ammunition in the magazine, 10 rounds of .40 calibre ammunition, the grey
reusable bag, the Ziploc
bag,
1273.38
grams
of
oxycodone
and
118.76 grams of heroin.
That is together with $910 in Canadian
currency, 0.55 grams of cocaine, 0.61 grams of oxycodone, and the cell phone,
which is particularized
by
a
property
tag
number.
That
is
together with two rounds of .40 calibre ammunition, three rounds of 9mm
ammunition, drug packaging, scales, spoons, scales, boxes, safe, gun kit, Allen
key, box cutters, plastic boxes, brown paper bag, pliers, vacuum seal bags, two
Google phones, 94 vape pens, ammunition box and bags, 76 rounds of 9mm
ammunition, and 41 rounds of .22 ammunition.
In addition to
that, the items listed under C, which I’m about to read out, are to be returned
to
the
lawful
owner,
and
that
includes
$2,000
of the
Canadian
currency
seized
from
Mr.
Sacchetti, which is the lawful property
of Veronica Adams. Earlier the court was advised that is with respect to money
which this person, Veronica Adams, is owed, but nonetheless, is generally what
would have been considered proceeds of crime.
The Crown is simply giving up its right to
having
forfeiture
of
that
money.
Under C2, are
items either unlawfully in the possession
of
Mr.
Sacchetti
-
under
C2
there
are no categories.
Property
listed in A, B and C2 are to be forfeited
to
Her
Majesty
the
Queen,
as
indicated,
but most specifically, the following is to be returned to Mr. Sacchetti:
Samsung S9 phone, five watches, gold
bracelet, Gucci bag, keys, Good Life bag, black T-shirt, and tire wrench. That
property was lawfully possessed by Mr. Sacchetti, and it is property that is
also jointly
owned
by
Mr.
Sacchetti’s
wife,
Monica
Sacchetti.
What
about
the
other
funds?
Y.
BRAR:
That’s
under
C1,
I
believe,
Your
Honour.
THE
COURT:
Sorry?
Y.
BRAR:
The
funds
that
are
going
to
the
other
person.
THE
COURT:
That’s
the
2,000.
What
about
the
other
money?
Y.
BRAR:
The
other
money’s
listed
under
the forfeited items.
THE
COURT:
$7,000
?
Where
is
that
listed?
Y.
BRAR:
It
should
be
there.
THE
COURT:
The
only
money
I
see
listed
here
is the
$2,000
that
the
Crown
has
agreed
go
to
this
lady.
Y.
BRAR:
I’m
sorry,
Your
Honour,
I’m
just
going to pull it up.
THE
COURT:
I’m
waiving
the
victim
fine
surcharge.
Y.
BRAR:
Oh,
sorry,
the
second
quantity
of
money seems to have been
cut off, so I’ll just send Your Honour a new copy, but it’s the nine - the one
- item number 10 under B, it says $910 in Canadian currency.
And then I’ll just get the other
[indiscernible].
THE
COURT:
I’m
asking
you
about
the
$7,180.
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
Your
Honour,
it
should
be
the
last item
on
the
–
oh,
it
should
be
the
last
item,
but I
think
it
got
cut
off
by
the
box.
I’ll
just
fix
it.
Sorry.
Thank you for catching that.
And Mr.
Sacchetti’s passport is also being returned to him.
I just realized I didn’t include
that
because
it
wasn’t
listed
under
-
THE COURT:
Why don’t I give this -
Y.
BRAR:
-
property.
THE
COURT:
-
back
to
you,
because
I
want
to
make
sure that he’s able to get everything -
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
I
agree.
THE
COURT:
-
and
it’s
properly
being
listed.
Does anyone
have any concern with my math?
I’m
open to that.
It’s fairly late in the
day, and I’ve been working on this for a significant period
of
time,
and
I
had
to
rush
at
the
end
with the
math.
So,
if
I’ve
made
a
mathematical
error, please let me know.
I
do need to sign the committal
warrant,
Mr.
Forte,
before
he
goes,
so
that’s why I want to make sure there’s no
mistake.
It’s
possession
for
the
purpose
of
trafficking, also the s.
95 possession of prohibited weapon can
be
the
subject
and
should
be
the
subject
of the s. 109 weapons prohibition for life.
Madam
Crown,
in
terms
of
the
109
weapons prohibition order -
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
Your
Honour.
THE
COURT:
-
are
you
submitting
that
it
should also be imposed for life in
relation to the breach of the prohibition order section?
I’m trying
to
find
that
in
the
section,
and
I
can’t get my hands on it.
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
Your
Honour.
I’ll
give
you
the
section of the
Code
.
It’s s.
109(3).
THE
COURT:
No,
I
know
it’s
for
life,
but
I’m
saying can it be - or should it be imposed for the
offence
of
breaching
the
prohibition
order?
Y.
BRAR:
Oh,
for
the
breaching
-
THE
COURT:
Right.
I
don’t
-
Y.
BRAR:
-
offence
as
well?
THE
COURT:
-
see
that
listed.
Y. BRAR:
Yes, that would be s. 109(1)(d), “An
offence
that
involves
a
firearm,”
et
cetera,
et cetera, “and” -
THE
COURT:
I
know.
That’s
the
offence
of possession, right?
Y.
BRAR:
No,
it
says,
“And
they
were
prohibited
by
an
order
made
under
the
Act
in
(d)”.
THE
COURT:
All
right.
You’re
right.
Okay,
so it’s
all
three,
yeah.
Did
you
have
any
comment
on that, Mr. Forte?
M.
FORTE:
No,
Your
Honour.
THE
COURT:
Okay.
Thanks.
So,
are
you
printing
out
that
forfeiture
order
on the clerk’s
computer, or what are you doing?
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
I’m
going
to
send
it
to
Madam Clerk in a moment.
THE
COURT:
Okay.
Y.
BRAR:
I’ve
sent
Madam
Clerk
the
amended
draft forfeiture order, which should now
have everything that’s mentioned in the ASF included. I added Mr. Sacchetti’s
passport to the items being returned to him and just the other drugs and
bullets
and
the
quantity
of
cash
to
the
items being forfeited.
THE
COURT:
I
haven’t
gone
back
and
done
the
math.
I
think
you
said
2,000
as
compared
to 2,910; I just saw that again.
2,910
was -
Y.
BRAR:
Yes.
THE
COURT:
So,
there’d
be
the
910
plus
the
7,000
figure; is that what you have?
Y.
BRAR:
Yes.
The
910
was
already
listed,
Your
Honour;
it
was
the
7,000
-
THE
COURT:
Oh,
just
that
one.
Y.
BRAR:
-
that
was
missing
because
it
was
the
items that weren’t on -
THE
COURT:
Okay.
Y.
BRAR:
-
the
exhibit
list
we
were
using,
so
I
just
fixed
them.
THE COURT:
Fine.
Thank you.
After you print
that,
can
you
show
it
to
Mr.
Forte
to
see
if
he’s
in agreement with it?
M. FORTE:
I know there’s items missing that are
seized evidence.
They’re not in the
ASF, Your Honour.
They’re part of the
seized items.
I don’t know what’s
going to happen to them, sunglasses and trinkets and such, if they’re going to
be destroyed or not, but certainly, that’s
not
an
exhaustive
list
of
all
the
property in the possession of the police.
THE COURT:
Well, if you need another order, if
you - if there are other items that your client or
his
family
want,
I’m
not
here
on
Monday,
but
I
could deal with it on Wednesday.
I
would consider I still have jurisdiction then, but don’t ask me six months from
now because I can’t stretch it that far.
Y.
BRAR:
If
his
family
goes
to
ask
for
his
belongings
from the police, usually the police will
contact
the
Crown
to
ask
if
those
items
were contemplated in court.
So, I just
want to be very clear for the record the - any sunglasses, trinkets or other
gold jewellery,
they’re
vaguely
mentioned
in
the
list
of items, but anything like that we would be saying should be returned to Mr.
Sacchetti’s
family.
M. FORTE:
I would just suggest, for what it’s
worth
-
and
I
apologize
to
Mr.
Sacchetti
and
his family; I
haven’t been much assistance to them, obviously; the sentence imposed is
exactly what the Crown was seeking, despite two days of submissions - but I
would suggest, on this very minor
point,
that
we
would
just
say
“anything
not included in property to be forfeited should be returned to Mr.
Sacchetti”.
Various clothing.
As Your Honour
said, the car was lived in. There’s
dozens
of
items
that
I’m
not
going
to sift through, it should just go back
to his family -
THE
COURT:
All
right.
Do
you
want
to
just
–
M.
FORTE:
-
in
my
submission.
THE COURT:
I’ll ask the clerk to pass you the
order
and
then
the
two
of
you,
three
of
you,
can just say what you want to put there.
M.
FORTE:
That
would
-
Y.
BRAR:
Yeah.
M. FORTE:
- be my submission.
Anything not included
to
be
forfeited
explicitly
should
be returned
to
Mr.
Sacchetti’s
family.
His
wife specifically is the person -
THE COURT:
Right, I don’t want them going down to
the property office and being told they have to
go
away
and
come
back.
So,
let’s
try
to
do
it the way you’ve suggested it so it’s
just one
trip.
M.
FORTE:
Right.
Which
is
why
I
think
it
should read “all of the property should be
returned to his family”.
Y.
BRAR:
I’ve
just
added
to
the
end
of
the
list,
“And any other personal items seized and any other
property
in
the
vehicle.”
M.
FORTE:
Thank
you.
THE
COURT:
So,
you
just
hand
wrote
it?
I’ll initial it -
Y.
BRAR:
Yes.
THE
COURT:
-
if
that’s
what
you
want
to
do,
and
we’ll copy it for everybody, rather than having make her print it again.
M.
FORTE:
Thank
you.
THE
COURT:
So,
if
you
could
copy
this
then
for
the Crown and defence.
Now, I know
they have to take him for the DNA, Mr.
Forte,
but
I
know
that
you
may
well
want
to see him for a few minutes.
Do you want to see him -
M.
FORTE:
No
need
to
see
him.
THE
COURT:
-
on
the
way
out?
M.
FORTE:
Thank
you,
Your
Honour.
I’ll
see
him at the jail.
THE
COURT:
Okay.
M.
FORTE:
Thank
you.
THE
COURT:
Thank
you,
Madam
Clerk.
CLERK
OF
THE
COURT:
Sorry,
Your
Honour,
are
the
other charges withdrawn?
Y.
BRAR:
Yes,
all
remaining
counts
on
all
existing
Informations
are
withdrawn.
THE
COURT:
Thank
you
for
reminding
us,
Madam
Clerk.
All
right,
all
remaining
counts
before
this
court
are to be marked withdrawn on the Informations before
the
court.
You
can
be
excused
if
you
wish.
I’m
going
to
be here for a little while with the clerk.
M.
FORTE:
If
I
may
be
excused,
Your
Honour?
THE
COURT:
Yes.
M.
FORTE
:
Thank
you.
Y.
BRAR:
Your
Honour,
if
my
colleague
and
I could also be excused?
THE
COURT:
Yes,
absolutely.
Y.
BRAR:
Thank
you.
Have
a
lovely
weekend.
THE
COURT:
Thank
you.
You
too.
Y.
BRAR:
Good
luck,
Mr.
Sacchetti.
