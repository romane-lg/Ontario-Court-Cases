Introduction:
[
1
]
On March 17, 2025, the first day of a four-day
trial, Mr. Seegobinsingh pleaded guilty to the following offences:
(i)
that on January 14
th,
2023, he did
wound, maim, disfigure or endanger the life of Rischu Mohindru, thereby
committing aggravated assault, contrary to
section 268(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
;
(ii)
that on January 14
th,
2023, he failed
to comply with his release order by not abiding by his curfew, contrary to
section 145(5)
(a) of the
Criminal Code
; and
(iii)
that on January 14
th
, 2023, he did
possess a weapon, to wit: a knife, for a purpose that was dangerous to the
public peace, contrary to
section 88(1)
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
2
]
I heard sentencing submissions on August 1,
2025, and reserved my judgment on the matter. These are my reasons.
[
3
]
In support of the guilty plea, Mr.
Seegobinsingh agreed to the following facts:
On January 14, 2023, in the
City of Brampton, at 10:50 pm, Mr. Seegobinsingh was in the parking lot of a
Harvey’s Restaurant. Alexander Dolles saw that Mr. Seegobinsingh was attempting
to break into cars; they argued. Mr. Seegobinsingh brandished a knife and said,
“Back up; I am going to fucking stab you.” The incident ended as he fled. Later,
at 11:30, Mr. Seegobinsingh was in the area of Kennedy Road and Scottsdale
Court — the victim, Mr. Mohindru, was walking back from the store with his
friend, Jaydyn Hurst-Tonge, when he was chased by Mr. Seegobinsingh and stabbed
in the upper right chest area. Mr. Mohindru was transported in serious
condition to Sunnybrook Hospital - a tube was placed in his chest, and three
staples were applied.
On October 18, 2021, Mr.
Seegobinsingh appeared in court to answer to several charges, including weapons
dangerous and assault with a weapon and was released on specific conditions: He
was not to possess any weapons and was to abide by a curfew from 8 am to 8 pm. On
January 14, 2023, he failed to comply with his release order by not being
inside his residence with his surety.
Victim Impact:
[
4
]
Mr. Mohindru did not submit a victim impact statement; however, his
friend, Jaydyn Hurst-Tonge, who witnessed the stabbing, did provide a
statement.
[
5
]
Jaydyn describes the profound and lasting impact of witnessing a violent
assault on a close friend, which occurred while they were walking together to
Jaydyn’s home. Jaydyn had to carry the injured friend to safety while he was
bleeding and struggling to breathe, an experience that was deeply traumatic and
has significantly affected Jaydyn’s mental health. Since the incident, Jaydyn
has suffered from severe social anxiety, insomnia, depression, substance abuse,
and poor eating habits. These symptoms have disrupted daily life, strained
relationships with family and friends, and led to social isolation. Jaydyn exhibits
a constant sense of hyper-vigilance and fear, especially in public settings,
due to concerns about potential retaliation from the offender, who knows
Jaydyn's address. This fear has limited Jaydyn’s ability to engage socially and
professionally. Economically, the trauma has impacted Jaydyn’s focus and
productivity at work, jeopardizing progress in an automotive technician
apprenticeship and threatening job security. The emotional toll has also led to
a breakdown in personal relationships and a loss of motivation and enthusiasm
for everyday activities. Jaydyn’s statements reflect a deep and ongoing
struggle to cope with the psychological, emotional, and practical consequences
of the incident.
The Offender’s Background:
[
6
]
After entering a guilty plea, a Pre-Sentence Report was prepared. Most
of the offender’s background information has been gathered from that Report.
[
7
]
Mr. Seegobinsingh is a 23-year-old Canadian citizen, born and raised in
Brampton. He comes from a family that experienced instability following his
parents’ divorce when he was eight. He has maintained a close relationship with
his mother and siblings, especially his older half-brother, despite a strained
relationship with his father, who has been largely absent from his life. Since
being placed under house arrest, Mr. Seegobinsingh has been living with his
maternal grandparents and extended family, where he has reportedly made
positive contributions.
[
8
]
Educationally, Mr. Seegobinsingh graduated from high school and
completed a mechanic apprenticeship. He aspires to pursue a career in
mechanical engineering. His employment history includes working for his
brother’s landscaping company and helping his mother with her catering
business. He is currently unemployed due to his legal circumstances.
[
9
]
The Report highlights concern about Mr. Seegobinsingh’s substance use
and anger management. He started drinking alcohol regularly at age 19, with
heavy use noted at 22. He attributes the offence to being intoxicated and
admits to unresolved anger issues. He has since stopped regular alcohol use and
enrolled in substance use and anger management programs through the Salvation
Army. His marijuana use is described as occasional and recreational.
[
10
]
Mr.
Seegobinsingh has no prior criminal record or history of community super­vision.
He was cooperative during his arrest and has taken responsibility for his
actions. He has shown remorse and hopes to improve himself, saying that his
time in custody has led to reflection and a commitment to change. He has not
been formally diagnosed with mental health issues, although his family doctor
suspects he may suffer from anxiety.
[
11
]
Mr.
Seegobinsingh presents as a young adult with potential for rehabilitation,
supported by a stable family environment and a willingness to participate in
therapeutic programs.
[
12
]
The
Report recommends that if the Court considers a community sentence, the
conditions should include regular reporting to a probation officer, non-contact
with the victim (Rischu Mohindru), a ban on possessing weapons, reside at an
approved address, and engagement in counselling for anger and substance use
issues.
The Positions
of the Parties:
[
13
]
The Crown proposed a custodial sentence totalling
15 months: 15 months for aggravated assault, two months for possessing a weapon
for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, to be served concurrently, and one
month for breach of the Release Order, also concurrent. Additionally, the Crown
recommended a two-year probation period with conditions that prohibit contact
with Mr. Mohindru and Mr. Hurst-Tonge, prohibit possession of weapons, require
a DNA order, and impose a 10-year prohibition on possessing weapons under
section 109.
[
14
]
The Crown emphasized the need for denunciation
and deterrence, citing the brazen and public nature of the attack, which was
random, unprovoked, and involved two victims—one of whom was physically wounded
and the other psychologically affected. The Crown argued that the severity of
the attack, the use of a dangerous weapon, and the fact that Mr. Seegobinsingh
was in breach of conditions at the time made a conditional sentence
inappropriate due to the high risk involved.
[
15
]
The Defence acknowledged that the Crown’s
position was fair, considering the aggravating factors, but urged the Court to
take into account Mr. Seegobinsingh’s unique circumstances. The Defence
emphasized his youth, absence of prior criminal history, and the difficult
conditions he faced during 69 days in custody, including extended lockdowns,
contracting COVID-19, and a life-threatening allergic reaction as a result of
being served a meal with sesame seeds. The Defence pointed out the substantial
time spent on restrictive bail—907 days—and argued that, with proper credit,
the accused had effectively served the equivalent of a 15-month jail sentence.
[
16
]
The Defence highlighted Mr. Seegobinsingh's
remorse, positive Pre-Sentence Report, educational achievements, and efforts to
address anger and alcohol issues. However, if the Court believed that Mr.
Seegobinsingh had not served sufficient pretrial custody and considered the
restrictive bail conditions, the Defence argued that a conditional sentence of four
to six months would be suitable, particularly given the systemic issues
impacting young Black men in the justice system.
Time in
Custody and Bail Conditions:
[
17
]
Mr. Seegobinsingh was in pre-sentence custody at
Maplehurst Correctional Complex for a total of 69 days, including a six-day
return in May 2023. He also spent over 907 days under highly restrictive house
arrest with GPS monitoring. His freedoms have been significantly limited.
Harsh
Conditions of Confinement –
Duncan
Credit
[
18
]
In addition to the enhanced credit for
pre-sentence custody under
section 719(3.1)
of the
Criminal Code
and the
principles set out in
R. v. Summers,
2014
SCC 26
,
[2014] 1 S.C.R. 575
the Defence respectfully
submits that the conditions endured by Mr. Seegobinsingh while incarcerated at
Maplehurst Correctional Complex warrant further mitigation under the principles
articulated in
R. v. Duncan
,
2016 ONCA 754
and affirmed in
R. v.
Marshall
,
2021 ONCA 344
. Mr. Seegobinsingh’s affidavit describes a range of
inhumane and degrading conditions, including triple bunking, unsanitary
facilities, near-daily lockdowns, lack of access to fresh air and exercise, and
a life-threatening allergic reaction caused by institutional negligence. These
conditions are similar to those deemed mitigating in
R. v. Vincent
,
2024
ONCJ 178
, where I granted a full year of mitigation in addition to
Summers
credit because of similarly harsh confinement. As the Court of Appeal
highlighted in
Marshall
,
Duncan
credit is not a simple
mathematical deduction but a discretionary factor in deciding an appropriate
sentence. Considering the documented psychological and physical effects of Mr.
Seegobinsingh’s confinement, the Defence argues that the Court should use its
discretion to apply
Duncan
credit as a mitigating factor, supporting the
appropriateness of a sentence of time already served.
Restrictive Bail Conditions –
Downes
Credit
[
19
]
Mr. Seegobinsingh’s bail conditions were stringent.
For more than two years, he was under house arrest with GPS monitoring and
could only leave with his surety. These conditions greatly limited his freedom
and social growth. Based on the principles in
R. v. Downes
(2006),
2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA)
, 79
O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) and confirmed in
R. v. C.C.
,
2021 ONCA 600
, such
restrictions are properly seen as mitigating when deciding a fit sentence.
[
20
]
In
R. v. Mok
,
[2017] O.J. No. 3758
, the Court
awarded 0.5 credit for each month of restrictive house arrest with electronic
monitoring. Mr. Seegobinsingh’s conditions were comparable, if not more severe.
The Defence submits that
Downes
credit should be applied to recognize
the punitive impact of these conditions, further supporting a sentence of time
served.
Sentencing Principles and Case Law:
[
21
]
The sentence must be proportionate to the
gravity of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility (s. 718.1).
The principle of restraint (s. 718.2(d), (e)) requires that incarceration be
imposed only where less restrictive sanctions are inappropriate. The Ontario
Court of Appeal in
R. v. Morris
,
2021 ONCA 680
, emphasized the
importance of considering systemic disadvantage, harsh pretrial conditions, and
rehabilitative potential when sentencing young Black offenders. Similarly, in
R.
v. Borde
(2003),
2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA)
, 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), and
R. v. Hamilton
(2004),
2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA)
, 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), the Court recognized that systemic racism and social
context are relevant to assessing moral culpability and crafting a fit sentence.
[
22
]
In the cases of
R. v. Byford
,
[2016] O.J.
No. 3413
;
R. v. Mair
,
[2019] O.J. No. 5162
, and
R. v. Tourville
,
2011 ONSC 1677 (CanLII)
, [2011] O.J. No. 1245, which were submitted by the Crown, the Courts applied the
sentencing principles outlined in
sections 718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
with careful attention to the individual circumstances of each offender and the
nature of the offence.
[
23
]
In the
Byford
decision, Justice Fuerst
emphasized the principles of denunciation and deterrence under
section 718
,
given the seriousness of the aggravated assault committed by an 18-year-old who
stabbed his stepfather multiple times. However, the Court also gave significant
weight to rehabilitation, noting the offender’s remorse, lack of prior record,
and mental health challenges. Section 718.1’s requirement for proportionality
was addressed by balancing the gravity of the offence with the offender’s low
risk of reoffending and strong family support. Under section 718.2, the Court
considered both aggravating factors (use of a weapon, domestic setting, lasting
injuries) and mitigating factors (guilty plea, youth, emotional instability).
The judge exercised restraint, imposing a 16-month custodial sentence followed
by probation, recognizing that a longer sentence would be unduly harsh given the
offender’s psychological vulnerabilities.
[
24
]
In
R. v. Mair
, Justice Ghosh applied
section 718
with a strong emphasis on denunciation and deterrence because of
the unprovoked and violent attack on two strangers. However, the Court also recognized
the offender’s rehabilitative needs, citing mental health and addiction issues,
including PTSD-like symptoms and a brain injury. Section 718.1 was interpreted
to require a sentence that is proportionate to both the offence and the
offender’s circumstances. Under section 718.2, the Court identified aggravating
factors such as the use of a weapon and causing serious injuries. Conversely,
mitigating factors included the offender’s guilty plea, lack of a criminal
record, and efforts to seek treatment. Justice Ghosh also exercised restraint
by crediting time served in pretrial custody, lockdowns, and restrictive bail
conditions, ultimately imposing an 18-month sentence with probation.
[
25
]
Justice Code’s decision in
R. v. Tourville
provides a nuanced interpretation of section 718, striking a balance between
denunciation and deterrence, with a strong emphasis on rehabilitation and
restorative justice, particularly under section 718.2(e) for Aboriginal
offenders. Mr. Tourville, a first-time offender of Aboriginal heritage, was convicted
of aggravated assault after a fight escalated into a stabbing. The Court
recognized the seriousness of the offence and the need for a custodial sentence,
but also took into account the offender’s history of abuse, addiction, and
successful alcoholism treatment. Section 718.1’s proportionality was addressed
by weighing the severity of the injuries against the offender’s rehabilitative
potential. The Court applied section 718.2(e) by incorporating a Gladue Report
and recommending culturally appropriate programs. The offender was sentenced to
21 months in prison and two years of probation, with conditions aimed at
supporting his ongoing rehabilitation and cultural reintegration.
[
26
]
These cases collectively illustrate how courts
interpret and apply the sentencing principles in
sections 718
–718.2 with a
focus on individualized justice, balancing the gravity of the offence with the
personal circumstances and rehabilitative prospects of the offender.
The Aggravating and Mitigating
Factors:
[
27
]
The aggravating factors in this case include the
use of a knife in a public setting, resulting in serious injuries to the victim
that required surgery to repair the lung and spleen. The assault occurred while
Mr. Seegobinsingh was already facing a charge for possession of a weapon for a
dangerous purpose, also involving a knife. The repeated involvement with
weapons and the severity of the injuries underscore the need for denunciation
and deterrence.
[
28
]
Conversely, the mitigating factors are
substantial. Mr. Seegobinsingh is a youthful, first-time offender with no prior
criminal record. He pleaded guilty and expressed genuine remorse. He has
complied with strict bail conditions for over two years, including house arrest
and GPS monitoring, which significantly restricted his liberty. He endured
harsh pre-trial custody conditions during the pandemic, including isolation and
inadequate access to basic hygiene and medical care. He has maintained steady
employment and is described by others as a caring and non-violent individual,
suggesting strong rehabilitative potential.
Conclusion:
[
29
]
Mr. Seegobinsingh has already endured the
punitive effects of incarceration and prolonged, restrictive bail. He has
demonstrated compliance, remorse, and a desire to rehabilitate. The principles
of proportionality, restraint, and rehabilitation all support a sentence of
time already served. Such a sentence would not diminish the seriousness of the
offence but would reflect the totality of Mr. Seegobinsingh’s experience and
the jurisprudence.
[
30
]
Therefore, Mr. Seegobinsingh is sentenced to 15
months' custody for the offence of aggravated assault. Concurrently, he will
receive a two-month jail sentence for the dangerous weapons count and a
one-month jail sentence for failing to comply with his release order. I will
grant Mr. Seegobinsingh 104 days of
Summers
credit, and 40 days for the
harsh institutional conditions at Maplehurst Correctional Complex, totalling
144 days or about 5 months, plus 907 days for restrictive bail conditions and
GPS monitoring. Additionally, I am prepared to give him 0.5 days of
Downes
credit, which is equivalent to 454 days or 15 months of custody.  Therefore,
Mr. Seegobinsingh has effectively already served what amounts to a 20-month
jail sentence, which significantly exceeds the 15-month jail term sought by the
Crown in this case.
[
31
]
I will order that Mr. Seegobinsingh be placed on
probation for two years with the following conditions:
(i)
Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
(ii)
Appear before the court when required.
(iii)
Report to a probation officer immediately and
thereafter as required.
(iv)
Reside at an address approved by the probation
officer.
(v)
Notify the probation officer of any change in
name, address, or employment.
(vi)
Not have any contact or communicate directly or
indirectly with Rischu Mohindru, Alexander Dolles and Jaydyn Hurst-Tonge.
(vii)
Do not possess any weapons as defined by the
Criminal
Code
.
(viii)
Attend and actively participate in any assessment, counselling or
rehabilitative programs as directed by the probation officer to address anger
management and substance abuse issues and sign any release of information forms
as will be necessary to monitor attendance and completion of any recommended
programs.
[
32
]
Pursuant to
s.109
of the
Criminal Code
,
Mr. Seegobinsingh is prohibited from possessing: any prohibited firearm,
restricted firearm, firearm part, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and
prohibited ammunition for life and any firearm (other than one that is
prohibited or restricted), crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition and
explosive substance for a period beginning today and ending in ten years.
[
33
]
Aggravated assault is a primary designated
offence. Mr. Seegobinsingh must supply a sample of his DNA for testing
immediately.
[
34
]
The victim fine surcharge is waived given his
financial circumstances.
