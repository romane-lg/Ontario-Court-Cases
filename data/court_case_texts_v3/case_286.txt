REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
1.0: 
INTRODUCTION
[
1
.]
The
Defendant, Jashandeep Bhandal, is on trial for two charges:  impaired driving
and failing to provide a breath sample, contrary to sections 320.14(1)(a) and
320.15(1), respectively, of the
Criminal Code of Canada
.
[
2
.]
On the
charge of impaired driving, the sole issue is whether the prosecution has
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the driver.
[
3
.]
With
respect to the count of fail to provide, the only issue is whether the police
had reasonable grounds to make the breath demand.
2.0:  FACTS
NOT IN DISPUTE
[
4
.]
This
matter arises out of a single car crash in the wee hours of December 30, 2023.
[
5
.]
Sometime
between 3:30 and 3:45 in the morning, a motorist was driving home with her
fiancé.  As they approached a dark roundabout in rural area, they noticed a car
bumper and other car parts laying on the road.  They stopped immediately to
investigate.  The motorist called the police while her fiancé went over a dented
guardrail and disappeared into a deep ditch to search for the car.  Within a
few minutes he located it and reported his finding to her.
[
6
.]
The
motorist called 911 and said that her fiancé found a car with a lone occupant
trapped inside the heavily damage vehicle, which was a VW four door Jetta.  All
of this was then transmitted to responding police and other emergency
personnel.
[
7
.]
Shortly
before 4:00 a.m. two police officers, Constables Brar and Deol, arrived on
scene.  Fire and ambulance staff arrived, too.
[
8
.]
Both
officers went into the ditch with the motorist’s fiancé.   They located the car,
which was lying on the passenger side making it impossible to get out on that
side.  The Jetta was resting precariously, being in real danger of sliding
further down the slope.
[
9
.]
The
driver’s door was so damaged that it took enormous effort of at least two men
to force it open.  The rear window of the car was missing.
[
10
.]
The
defendant was sitting in the front passenger seat with lots of blood on his
face caused by an obvious injury to his head.
[
11
.]
The
priority of the police was to remove the injured defendant from the car. When
helping him out the driver’s door, the police observed that the steering wheel airbag
and driver’s left side airbag had deployed. The airbag on the passenger’s right
side was also deployed, but not the passenger dashboard airbag.
[
12
.]
In the
brief time they were first at the car, the police saw blood on the steering
wheel airbag.  They did not notice any blood on the passenger side of the car.
[
13
.]
Despite
his injury, the defendant was conscious and mobile.  He was able to slide
across from the passenger seat and exit from the driver’s door.
[
14
.]
The
defendant was obviously impaired to drive safely: he smelled of alcohol, his
eyes were red and glossy, he was unsteady on his feet, he was uncooperative and
belligerent with the ambulance personnel who arrived on scene, and he declared
to the police that he was drunk.
[
15
.]
While the
defendant was in the care of medical attendants, the police went back over the
guardrail to look for other potential victims as they wanted to rule out any
other occupants who might have been ejected in the accident.  A visual search
of the area failed to locate anyone else.  There was insufficient snow to see
any footprints.  Firefighters did a thermal scan of the around the Jetta and
found no heat signatures.  Consequently, there were no easily identifiable
signs of anyone being associated with the crash except the defendant.
[
16
.]
Just
before 5:00 a.m. the defendant was arrested by P.C. Brar for impaired driving. 
P.C. Brar made a breath demand, but the defendant outright refused to comply
with it.
[
17
.]
At the
time of arrest, P.C. Brar was uncertain if he had checked ownership of the Jetta. 
He agreed that the defendant was not in possession of the keys when searched
and that he was not sure if the keys were found in or around the car.  The
officer also agreed that in his experience, airbags do not always deploy when
there is someone seated near them.
3.0:  ISSUE #1:  WAS THE DEFENDANT THE OPERATOR OF THE
JETTA?
3.1:  Positions of the Parties
[
18
.]
The
defendant argued that the Crown has failed to prove to the requisite standard
that he was the operator of the car that left the road and landed in the ditch. 
They submit that the totality of the evidence may raise the suspicion that he
was the driver, but nothing more than that.
[
19
.]
The
prosecution submitted that despite any direct evidence the inescapable
conclusion in the circumstances is that the defendant was indeed the driver.
3.2:  Applicable Legal Principles
[
20
.]
To find
that a defendant is guilty on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the trier
of fact must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his/her guilt is the
only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the whole of the evidence
after considering all other plausible theories and reasonable possibilities
that are inconsistent with guilt:
R. v. Villaroman
,
2016 SCC 33 (CanLII)
,
[2016] S.C.J. No.
33
.
[
21
.]
"Other
plausible theories" or "other reasonable possibilities" must be
based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or the absence of
evidence, not on speculation.  A helpful way of describing the line between
plausible theories and speculation is that to
justify a conviction, the
circumstantial evidence, assessed in light of human experience, should be such
that it excludes any other reasonable alternative.  The trier of fact should
not act on alternative interpretations of the circumstances that it considers
to be unreasonable; any alternative inferences must be reasonable, not just
possible. The burden on the Crown does not extend to disproving every possible
conjecture; reasonable doubt is not to be based on speculation or conjecture:
Villaroman
,
at para
35 to 43
; 50.
3.3:  Principles Applied
[
22
.]
I find
the following facts on the totality of the evidence:
(a)
The
defendant was alone in the motor vehicle when others arrived;
(b)
His face
was covered in blood;
(c)
Only the
driver’s side airbag had blood on it;
(d)
The blood
on the driver’s side airbag was obvious;
(e)
The
passenger side dashboard airbag was not deployed;
(f)
No blood
was observed on the passenger side dashboard or deployed side airbag;
(g)
The car
was resting on its passenger side, making it impossible to escape from that
side;
(h)
The
driver’s door was too damaged for anyone to open it by themselves making it
unlikely that any other occupant could exit the car by that door;
(i)
Noone
else associated with the vehicle was present notwithstanding a serious crash
where an occupant was badly hurt and no one other than a bystander reported it;
(j)
There was
an unexplained single car collision on a clear, lightly snow-covered road, with
the only occupant being too drunk to drive safely.
[
23
.]
The
defence submits the following evidence, or lack thereof, supports a reasonable
possibility that someone else was driving:
(a)
The
driver must have sustained a bleeding injury, given blood on the driver’s
airbag.  The police did not closely examine the interior of the Jetta, either
in time, detail, or good lighting, so that it is reasonably possible they
missed seeing blood on the passenger side which may then be consistent with the
defendant as passenger.
(b)
Given the
same brief and superficial inspection of the car that it is reasonably possible
that the actual driver, injured, bleeding and unable to get out the driver’s
door, crawled over the front seat, escaped through the open rear window, and
took off;
(c)
The
police conceded that sometimes airbags do not deploy, even in serious crashes
which means that it is reasonably possible that the passenger dashboard air bag
did not deploy even with the defendant sitting there; and
(d)
The
police did not find car keys on the defendant and there is no evidence the keys
were found in the car later on.
[
24
.]
I agree
with the defence that the negative result of the thermal scan is not evidence
that supports a finding that the defendant was alone at the time of the
collision.  It was a very cold December morning, and the scan was conducted
quite some time after the motorist and her fiancé stopped to investigate.  It
is plausible and even likely that if someone else was in the car then left the
scene that their heat signature would have dissipated at the time of the scan.
[
25
.]
On the
evidentiary record before me, I find that while all things are possible, it is
not reasonably possible in this case that someone else was driving.  I find
that based on human experience and common sense that had there been someone
else driving that they would have known the defendant. I further find that they
would not abandon the defendant who had an obvious and serious head wound and leave
him to his fate in the freezing cold without offering aid or standing by to
help emergency personnel.
[
26
.]
The
failure of the police to see blood anywhere other than the front interior
invites conjecture that there was blood elsewhere that went unnoticed.  The
defence submitted that the bloodied so-called driver may have gone out the back
window, thus leaving what they say is a trail of blood in his wake that would
be easily seen.  To be plausible, this scenario relies on the assumption that
escape by the back window was realistically possible, which I find as a fact
was not.
[
27
.]
If there
was so-called driver who could escape by the back window then that route was
also available to the defendant.  I find that since he was conscious and mobile
despite his head injury (after all, he got out of the car on his own steam) that
he would have likely escaped with the other person.  This makes more sense than
remaining in a car that seemed poised to slip further down and likely lead to
serious bodily harm or death.  I therefore find it speculative that escape via
the broken rear window was reasonably possible on this evidentiary record.
[
28
.]
The
evidence regarding the undeployed passenger dashboard airbag and the absence of
car keys are entirely neutral and do not raise a reasonable possibility that
someone else was driving given my findings of fact, above.  With respect to the
keys, one must recall two things.  First, this was violent crash, and the keys
could be anywhere.  Second, if the keys were inside the car, the police did not
find them because they did not examine the interior in a thorough way due its
precarious position.  To suggest that the keys were in the possession of a
mystery driver is to invite unjustified speculation.
[
29
.]
Based on
the evidentiary record before me, I find that the only rational conclusion is
that the defendant was drunk when he drove, alone, over the guardrail and went
deep into the ditch.  The Crown has proven this fact beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
30
.]
I
therefore find the defendant guilty of Count #1.
4.0:  ISSUE #2: ASSUMING THE DEFENDANT
WAS NOT ACTUALLY DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED, WAS IT REASONABLE FOR THE POLICE TO
BELIEVE HE WAS THE DRIVER?
4.1:  Preamble
[
31
.]
Having
found as a fact that the defendant was the driver of the Jetta while he was
impaired, the only conclusion is that the police had reasonable and probable
grounds to make the breath demand, with which the defendant refused to comply.
[
32
.]
Although
this issue is therefore moot, I intend to address for the sake of completeness.
4.2:  Positions of the Parties
[
33
.]
The
defence submits that P.C. Brar ignored facts and lack of evidence that ought to
have led him to have nothing more than hunches and guesses that the defendant
was the driver.  They submit, for example, that the absence of car keys on the
defendant, the failure to examine the interior carefully for blood, the
purported escape route out the back window, the failure to check the rear
driver’s side passenger door, the obvious futility of a thermal scan, and the
failure to check who the owner was, should have cumulatively sparked a meaningful
doubt in P.C. Brar’s mind that the defendant was the driver.  The defence
submits that while Brar may subjectively and honestly believed he had grounds
to make a breath demand, this belief was not reasonable.
[
34
.]
The
prosecution submits that Brar’s reliance on the following information known to him
at the time makes his belief reasonable:
(a)
Details
of the collision provided by dispatch;
(b)
Not
seeing anyone else in the area associated with the car;
(c)
The only
frontal airbag deployed was that of the driver;
(d)
The
driver’s airbag had blood on it;
(e)
The defendant’s
face was covered in blood;
(f)
Blood was
not seen anywhere else by P.C. Brar;
(g)
That the
collision happened very recently; and
(h)
He
considered, then ruled out, a possible ejection of other occupants for two
reasons:  the results of the thermal scan and negative results following a search
of the area around the car.
4.3:  Applicable Legal Principles
[
35
.]
Reasonable and probable
grounds must be honestly and subjectively held by the officer and his honest
belief must be objectively justified:

.
[
36
.]
The objective inquiry asks
whether a reasonable person, standing in the shoes of the police officer, would
have believed that reasonable grounds existed:
Storrey
, at pp. 250-51. 
When considering whether an officer’s subjective belief is objectively
reasonable, the court looks at the objectively discernible facts through the
eyes of a reasonable person with the same knowledge, training, and experience
as the officer, bearing in mind any exigent circumstances:

;
R. v. Amofa
,
2011 ONCA 368
, at ¶
19
.
[
37
.]
Determining
whether sufficient grounds exist to justify an exercise of police powers is not
a “scientific or metaphysical exercise”, but one that calls for the application
of common sense, flexibility, and practical everyday experience:
R. v.
MacKenzie,
2013 SCC 50 (CanLII)
,
[2013] 3 S.C.R. 250
, at ¶
73
;
R. v. Desilva
,
2022 ONCA
879
.  While the reasonable grounds requirement does not rise as high as a
balance of probabilities or a
prima facie
case, mere hunches or
intuition based on an officer's experience are not sufficient:
R. v.
MacKenzie
, supra, at ¶
64
.
An officer is
entitled to rely on conclusions based on a reasonable belief that certain facts
exist even if that belief turns out to be mistaken:
R. v. Robinson
,
2016 ONCA 402
at para.
40
.
[
38
.]
The officer is not required
to establish a
prima facie
case for conviction before making the arrest,
or to consider all alternative explanations for the observed conduct:
R. v.
Mitchell,
[2004] O.J. No. 435 (S.C.J.)
at ¶10;
R. v. Bush
,
2010 ONCA 554 (CanLII)
,
[2010] OJ
No 3453 (C.A.)
. However, the officer is obligated to consider all information
known to them, unless the officer has good reason to find an exculpatory factor
to be unreliable:

;
R. v. St. Clair
,
2021 ONCA
895
at para.
27
.
[
39
.]
The test is met where, based
on all of the circumstances known to the officer, “credibly based probability”
replaces suspicion:
R. v. Debot,
1989 CanLII 13 (SCC)
,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140
, at p.
1166

;
R. v

.
[
40
.]
"Reasonable
grounds" is essentially an opinion. As such, the belief, based on
perceived facts, is frequently a compilation of a state of facts that are too
subtle and complicated to be narrated separately and distinctly. In dealing
with probabilities relating to human behaviour, a trained officer is entitled
to draw inferences and make deductions based on his experience:
R. v.
Censoni,
[2001] O.J. No. 5189 (S.C.J.)
.
[
41
.]
The Court must consider the
totality
of the evidence for the witness' reasonable ground to believe the subject is
impaired, not any individual sign on its own:
R. v. Huddle
,
1989 ABCA 318 (CanLII)

at ¶ 24
;
R. v. McMillan
,
[2003] O.J. No. 4284 (S.C.J.)
.
4.4:  Principles Applied
[
42
.]
I reject the defence
submission that P.C. Brar had tunnel vision and ignored obvious evidence or
lack of evidence.  To ignore something, one must first perceive it, then choose
to set it aside in favour of other considerations.  In this case, I find that
P.C. Brar was not paying close attention to such things as the broken rear
window.  He did not ignore potential blood all over the interior of the car
because he was not looking for it, nor was it reasonable for him to make a close
examination.  It was dark.  The car was in danger of sliding further down the
slope, making time of the essence to focus on what mattered, which was rescuing
the defendant.  This, in turn, made such examinations as he conducted very
brief in scope and duration.
[
43
.]
I agree with the defence that
in these circumstances it was unreasonable for P.C. Brar to rely on the
negative results of the thermal scan.  However, the remaining factors he
considered, including searching and then failing to see anyone else around,
were objectively reasonable.
[
44
.]
It was also reasonable for
P.C. Brar to believe the collision happened shortly before the motorist and her
fiancé stopped to help.  P.C. Brar disagreed with the suggestion that given the
time of day and the rural location of the crash, that it could have happened a
long time before help arrived.  The basis for his evidence was that in his
experience he would expect traffic at that time and place to go by at least
every fifteen minutes.  Not only was this evidence unchallenged, but it was
substantially confirmed by the police car dashcam video which revealed that
more than five uninvolved cars drove by in only few minutes at the scene.
[
45
.]
Applying the relevant legal
principles to the facts of this case, I find P.C. Brar had ample reasonable
grounds to make a breath demand.  I therefore conclude that the breath demand
was valid, even assuming a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the driver.
[
46
.]
I therefore find the
defendant guilty of Count #2.
5.0:  CONCLUSIONS
[
47
.]
For the reasons set out
herein, I find Jashandeep Bhandal guilty of impaired driving and of refusing to
provide a breath sample.
[
48
.]
The parties are invited to
make submissions as to sentence.
