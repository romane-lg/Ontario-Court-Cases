Porter J.:
[
1
]
Yafet Banjaw (“Mr. Banjaw”) is charged in an
11-count information with the careless storage of numerous firearms and
ammunition in his apartment on June 12, 2024, contrary to
s. 86(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
.
[
2
]
Section 86(1)
of the
Criminal Code
states, “Every person commits an offence who, without lawful excuse, uses, carries,
handles, ships, transports or stores a firearm, a prohibited weapon, a
restricted weapon, a prohibited device or any ammunition or prohibited
ammunition in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the
safety of other persons.”
[
3
]
The first issue in the trial was whether, in
the course of obtaining and executing a search warrant, there was a breach of
Mr. Banjaw’s s. 8
Charter
right to be free from unreasonable search and
seizure.  If the search was lawful, the trial issue was whether the Crown had
proven that the storage of the firearms and ammunition, which Mr. Banjaw
acknowledged he owned, was careless in breach of
s. 86(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
.
[
4
]
To assist Mr. Banjaw in preparing and
presenting his section 8
Charter
argument, and his defence at trial, A. Goodman
was appointed as Amicus.  Mr. Goodman was of great assistance to the court, and
to Mr. Banjaw, in advocating Mr. Banjaw’s position on the
Charter
voir
dire
and the trial.
[
5
]
The fundamental issue in the section 8
Charter
application was whether the observations of ammunition made by the resident
manager, Milton Grant, at the apartment building at […] Bamburgh Circle, Unit […],
Toronto where Mr. Banjaw lived, combined with an opinion from a police officer
at the Guns and Gangs Unit of the Toronto Police Service  formed the proper
basis for the issuance of the search warrant executed on June 12, 2024, and
which resulted in the seizure of the firearms and ammunition which were the subject
of the charges before the court.
[
6
]
Milton Grant testified on the blended
voir
dire
that in June 2024 he was the resident manager of the building at […]
Bamburgh Circle.  The building is a 20-storey multi-unit residential building. 
He was responsible for contact with building tenants with respect to organizing
repairs performed by contractors hired by the building owners to perform
maintenance on the apartments in the building.
[
7
]
He has had that position for four years and
identified Mr. Banjaw as living in unit […] in that building.  He testified
that the leaseholder of the unit is Mr. Banjaw’s mother, but that Mr. Banjaw
was living in the unit in June 2024.
[
8
]
In June 2024, the annual cleaning of the air
conditioner ducts and grills was due and, as part of his responsibilities, Mr.
Grant organized the cleaning schedule with the contractor retained to perform
the service.  The schedule provided that floors 14, 15, 16 and 17 would have
the work performed on June 7.
[
9
]
Mr. Grant, along with a co-worker Neil
Bryan, prepared notices for the tenants which were distributed by Mr. Bryan and
Mr. Grant to each of the units on those floors about one week before the
scheduled maintenance to inform the residents of the scheduled maintenance.
[
10
]
He testified that he and Mr. Bryan together
placed the notices on the tenants’ doors advising the tenants of the scheduled
maintenance.  He could not recall on which floor he distributed the notices,
and on which floor Mr. Bryan distributed the notices, but it was his evidence
that between the two of them, notices were provided to all of the tenants in
each of the units on those floors that the scheduled maintenance would occur on
June 7, 2024.
[
11
]
Mr. Grant testified that on June 7 he
attended Mr. Banjaw’s unit with the air conditioner technician to perform the
scheduled maintenance.  No one was present in the unit when they attended.  While
he was leaving to knock on the unit next door to advise them of the upcoming
service, Mr. Grant was summoned by the air conditioner technician to see what the
technician had seen in front of the air conditioner unit.
[
12
]
Mr. Grant testified that what he saw was
what he believed to be the ammunition magazine for a firearm with one bullet in
the magazine protruding.  He took a photograph of the ammunition magazine which
was filed in evidence as Exhibit 5.
[
13
]
He saw a few boxes on the floor around the
magazine.  After he took the photograph Exhibit 5, he noticed another box to
the right of the ammunition magazine that appeared to have 2 handgun ammunition
magazines.  He saw this box on the floor next to the couch.  He testified that
he saw two magazines in that box without being able to see ammunition.
[
14
]
After taking the photograph, he saw a
computer in the room, with a camera attached to the top of it, which he thought
might be filming his actions in the apartment so he took no more pictures.
[
15
]
Mr. Grant testified he was not familiar with
firearms so he was not certain that the magazine was real.  He contacted his
property manager and she instructed him to contact the police which he did.
Evidence of Officer Wells
[
16
]
Officer David Wells testified that on June
10, 2024 he received the dispatch to attend at […] Bamburgh Circle regarding a
suspicious incident.  He spoke with Milton Grant and, after referring to his notes,
testified that Mr. Grant indicated that while present in the apartment with a
maintenance worker on June 7, he observed a firearm magazine which he
photographed.  He was shown the photograph Exhibit 5 taken by Mr. Grant and
testified that he gave Mr. Grant the link to provide the photograph to the
police by uploading it on to evidence.com.  He testified that when he saw the
magazine in the photograph, he thought it appeared to have a real bullet and based
on the photograph, it appeared to not be safely stored given its location on
the floor.  He testified that based on the presence of the magazine he thought
there may be a firearm in the apartment.
[
17
]
By referring to his notes in
cross-examination, he testified that the information from Mr. Grant he had noted
was that Mr. Grant observed “4 to 5 handguns and magazines, possibly extended”.
 He testified that he was told that there were guns lying around not just the
magazines.
[
18
]
He testified that he prepared a report with
the information he received and sent it to Detective Constable (“DC”) Shafiq.
The Information to Obtain and
Evidence of Sergeant Melissa Cohen
[
19
]
Sergeant Cohen has been a police officer
with the Toronto Police Service for 19½   years.  She was a Detective Constable
in 2024 when she prepared the Information to Obtain (“ITO”) for the search warrant
executed in this case.  She was the affiant of the ITO in this case and has
previously prepared at least 50 applications for search warrants.
[
20
]
The ITO was filed as Exhibit 7 in the
blended
voir dire
and contains a summary of the information received
from Mr. Grant including information that he observed a rifle magazine with
ammunition in it on the floor in unit […] at […] Bamburgh Circle on June 7,
2024, along with “some extended overcapacity magazines for handguns observed on
the floor”.
[
21
]
The photograph marked Exhibit 5 taken by Mr.
Grant was attached to the ITO.  It clearly shows the large firearm magazine
with the bullet at the end lying on the apartment floor surrounded by several
boxes and envelopes.
[
22
]
The ITO contained information that the
apartment was occupied by Yafet Banjaw (DOB 1994-12-10), and that a Canadian
Firearms Registry online check revealed that he had a firearms licence for
three registered firearms which may be stored both at an alternative location
and at his registered address of […] Bamburgh Circle, Scarborough.
[
23
]
At paragraph 9 of the ITO, DC Cohen states:
“At
approximately 7:09 PM, DC Shafiq received information form [sic] an officer at
Guns and Gangs Task Force that the rifle magazine picture[sic] on the floor in
the photo is a Prohibited Device.”
[
24
]
The ITO states at paragraph14:
“Although
the affiant is aware that Banjaw is licensed to possess 3 registered firearms,
there is a believe[sic] that there are prohibited devices inside his unit at […]
Bamburgh Circle that he is not legally allowed to possess.”
[
25
]
The affiant deposes in paragraph 15 that she
has reasonable grounds to believe that Banjaw is in possession of a prohibited
device, namely the rifle magazine and the extended handgun magazines that were
observed on the floor in the living room inside the apartment.
[
26
]
The search warrant marked as Exhibit 10 was
issued granting the authority to search the apartment for the stipulated rifle
and handgun magazines, in relation to an alleged offence of the possession of a
prohibited device contrary to
section 92(2)
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
27
]
Detective David Fisher, who was the officer-in-charge
of the execution of the search warrant, testified that after the numerous items
seized in the execution of the search warrant were examined, it was determined
that the large black firearm magazine photographed in Exhibit 5 had been
modified internally with a pin to hold only five bullets.  It appeared to be
capable of holding more than five bullets, which made its appearance in Exhibit
5, when seen by Mr. Grant and subsequently by the investigating officers, to be
an overcapacity magazine which would have been a prohibited device.
[
28
]
After examining the firearms and the
magazines seized in the execution of the warrant, it was determined that none
were prohibited devices, and while Mr. Banjaw was initially arrested for
possession of prohibited devices, he was advised while at the police station
shortly after his arrest, that the charges he was facing would be careless
storage of ammunition and firearms contrary to
section 86(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
.
[

The defence called no evidence on the s. 8
Charter

or on the trial
.
The Law on a
Garofoli
Application
[
30
]
MacPherson J.A. summarized the standard of
review on a
Garofoli
application in
R. v. Ebanks,
2009 ONCA 851 (CanLII)
, 97 O.R.(3d) 721
(Ont. C.A.), application for leave to appeal dismissed
2010 CanLII 34797
(SCC)
.  He stated at para. 20:
“Judges reviewing
wiretap affidavits, or any materials in support of prior judicial
authorizations, work within a narrow jurisdictional compass.  In
R. v.
Garofoli,
1990 CanLII 52 (SCC)
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421 Sopinka J. summarized the standard of review at
p.1452:
“The reviewing
judge does not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. 
If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on
the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have
granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere.  In this
process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new
evidence are all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review,
their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the
decision of the authorizing judge.”
[
31
]
As MacPherson J.A. noted in
R. v. Ebanks
,
supra
, at para.
21
:
“The sole function
of the reviewing court is to assess the record that was before the issuing
judge, as amplified on review, and determine whether the authorization
could
have issued.  This review has nothing to do with whether the reviewing court
would
have issued the authorization, as a
Garofoli
application at trial must
not become a hearing
de novo:
see
Garofoli
at p. 1452.”
[
32
]
The limited scope of the review jurisdiction
is the same whether the attack on the warrant is limited to a facial validity
challenge or whether it is a sub-facial challenge which goes behind the form of
the Information To Obtain (“ITO”) to attack or impeach the reliability of its
content.
[
33
]
As Watt J.A. states
in R. v. Sadikov
,
2014 ONCA 72 (CanLII)
, [2014] O.J. No. 376 (Ont. C.A.) at paras.
37-38
:
“A facial validity
challenge requires the reviewing judge to examine the ITO and to determine
whether, on the face of the information disclosed there, the justice
could
have issued the warrant:
R. v. Araujo,
2000 SCC 65
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992
at para.
19
.  The record examined on a facial review is fixed: it is the ITO,
not an amplified or enlarged record:
R. v. Wilson,
2011 BCCA 252
….at para.
39.
Sub-facial
challenges go behind the form of the ITO to attack or impeach the reliability
of its content:
Araujo
,
at para.
50
; and
Wilson
,
at para.
40
. 
Sub-facial challenges involve an amplified record, but do not expand the scope
of review to permit the reviewing judge to substitute his or her view for that
of the authorizing judicial officer:
Araujo
,
at para.
51
; and
R. v.
Garofoli
,
…. at p.1452.  The task of the reviewing judge on a sub-facial
challenge is to consider whether, on the record before the authorizing justice
as amplified on the review, the authorizing justice
could
have issued
the warrant:
Araujo
,
at para.
51
; and
Garofoli
,
at 1452.  The
analysis is contextual:
Araujo
,at
para.
54
.  The reviewing judge should
carefully consider whether sufficient reliable information remains in the
amplified record, in other words, information that might reasonably be
believed, on the basis of which the enabling warrant could have issued:
Araujo
,
at para.
52
.”
The Nature of
Sub-Facial Challenges to an ITO
[
34
]
In
R. v. Phan,
2020 ONCA 298
Strathy
C.J.O. stated the following with respect to the sub-facial challenge of a
warrant or authorization at para. 49:
“Typically,
on a sub-facial challenge, the accused argues that misleading or inaccurate
portions of the ITO must be excised, and the validity of the authorization is
determined by what remains.  The accused may also argue that ‘the augmented
record placed before the reviewing judge demonstrates that the affiant
deliberately, or at least recklessly, misled the issuing judge, rendering the
entire ITO unreliable as a basis upon which to issue a warrant’:
R. v.
Shivrattan,
2017 ONCA 23
,346 C.C.C. (3d), at para. 26, leave to appeal
refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No.93.”
[
35
]
In
R. v. Phan
, supra
, the Court of
Appeal has emphasized the importance of not permitting a
Garofoli
application
to turn into a trial of the accuracy of the informant’s allegations.  As C. J.
Strathy stated at paras. 51-52:
“As the
determination of whether the statutory conditions have been met focuses on the
affiant’s reasonable belief, the
Garofoli
analysis does not determine
whether the allegations in support of the authorization were ultimately true.  It
determines whether the affiant had ‘a reasonable belief in the existence of the
requisite statutory grounds’:
Pires; Lising,
at para. 41.  And this
turns on what the affiant knew or ought to have known at the time the affidavit
in support of the authorization was sworn.  The parties agree that the
applicable test is set out in
World Bank,
at paras.
122-3:
‘an error
or omission is not relevant on a
Garofoli
application if the affiant
could not reasonably have known of it. Testing the affidavit against the
ultimate truth rather than the affiant’s reasonable belief would turn a
Garofoli
hearing into a trial of every allegation in the affidavit, something this court
has long sought to prevent.
When
assessing a sub-facial challenge, it is important to note that affiants may not
ignore signs that other officers may be misleading them or omitting material information.
 However, if there is no indication that anything is amiss, they do not need to
conduct their own investigation [Citations omitted]’.
Typically,
evidence that the affiant knew or ought to have known was false, inaccurate, or
misleading will be ‘excised’ from the ITO when determining whether the
authorization was lawfully issued.  If there is additional evidence that the
affiant knew or ought to have known was required for full and frank disclosure,
it should be added back:
World Bank
, at para.121;
Booth,
at para.
59.”
Analysis of the s.8
Charter
Application
[
36
]
In his able submissions, Mr. Goodman, Amicus,
submits that it was clear that, as Mr. Banjaw was a licensed firearm owner,
there was no urgency facing the police when they learned that a magazine was
observed in the apartment unit which the police believed was solely occupied by
the licensed gun owner.  Mr. Goodman suggested that the police failed to take
reasonable steps to conduct a further investigation such as interviewing Mr.
Banjaw before jumping to the conclusion that the magazine observed was a
prohibited device, when in fact it was not.
[
37
]
Mr. Goodman submits that there was no
detailed description of the terms of Mr. Banjaw’s authorization to clarify
whether he was authorized to possess a prohibited device, and the ITO was
deficient in this regard.
[
38
]
I do not accept that the police were
required to conduct an interview of Mr. Banjaw before seeking a search warrant
to pursue the investigation in the circumstances.  No evidence was called on the
voir dire
to suggest that there was any legal basis on which Mr. Banjaw
could lawfully possess a prohibited device.
[
39
]
In my view, it was open to the issuing
justice to find that there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe that
the firearm magazine, observed by Mr. Grant, and photographed in a photograph
contained in the ITO, which a police officer from the Guns and Gangs unit
opined was a prohibited  device, was a prohibited device providing a proper
basis for the issuance of a search warrant  to search for the itemized  alleged
prohibited devices  named in the search warrant, in relation to the alleged
offence of possession of a prohibited device, contrary to
section 92 (2)
of
the
Criminal Code
.
[
40
]
In my opinion, the justice of the peace was
entitled to issue the search warrant based on the information provided to him
in the ITO, and the search warrant was properly issued.
[
41
]
Accordingly, the police were lawfully
present in the unit when the search warrant was executed, and the observations
made of the firearm and ammunition, and the manner in which they were stored,
were lawfully obtained and form the basis of this prosecution for careless
storage of the firearms and ammunition found in in the apartment.
The Evidence of Careless Storage
[
42
]
An entry video of unit […] was filed as
Exhibit 8 in the trial showing the state of the apartment upon the entry of the
police when executing the search warrant on June 12, 2024.
[
43
]
Sergeant Cohen was one of the search
officers and testified as to her observations during the execution of the
search warrant.  The entry video shows that unit […] was a very small apartment
overwhelmingly cluttered, disorganized, and covered throughout with boxes,
envelopes, domestic paraphernalia, and scattered throughout the apartment were
numerous easily accessible firearms, and ammunition, located in both the living
room and in the bedroom of the apartment.
[
44
]
In an Agreed Statement of Facts, it was
admitted that Mr. Banjaw is the sole occupant of Unit […] at […] Bamburgh
Circle.
[
45
]
It was also admitted that he is the owner of
all of the firearms and ammunition seized by the police during the execution of
the search warrant.  The following is a list of the firearms and ammunition he
admitted owning:
1.
Glock 20 Gen4 Hand gun;
2.
CZ P-10 C Hand gun;
3. 
Hi-Point Model JMP hand gun;
4.  T81SA
Cal.7.62mm Semi-Auto rifle;
5.  Savage
Arms 64 22 Cal rifle
6.  Hunt
Group Arms Sem-Auto Shotgun
Ammunition
1. 10mm
Blazer ammunition;
2. 9mm
Luger ammunition;
3  .45
cal. ammunition
4.  7.62
mm ammunition
5.  22
cal. rim ammunition.
[
46
]
Mr. Banjaw admitted that all of the firearms
and ammunition tested as being in proper working order.
[
47
]
The certificate of analysis of Philip Butler
of the Gun and Gang Task Force-Firearm Investigation and Analysis Unit, filed
on consent as Exhibit 13, establishes that each of the three handguns found in
Mr. Banjaw’s apartment meet the definition of a “restricted firearm” and each
of the rifles and the shotgun meet the definition of “non-restricted firearm” under
s. 84
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
48
]
All of the cartridges seized were in proper
working order.  There were 45 cartridges seized that worked in the Hi-Point
handgun, 393 that worked in the Glock handgun, and 50 for the CZ P-10 C
handgun.
[
49
]
There were 50 cartridges seized that were
operational in the Savage rifle and 20 for the Type 81 SA rifle.
[
50
]
Two of the handguns, the Glock and the CZ
P-10 C had trigger locks, but otherwise were easily accessed in the apartment
bedroom.  The Glock was leaning up against the wall in the bedroom.  The CZ P-10
C handgun was in a box in the bedroom closet.
[
51
]
The Hi-Point firearm was in the bedroom
closet with a zip-tie through the trigger but had no trigger lock.
[
52
]
The T81 SA Cal 7.62 Semi Auto rifle was
standing up in the front closet just inside the front door of the apartment.  The
Savage Arms rifle was standing up in an alcove in the bedroom, and the Hunt
Group Arms semi-auto Shotgun was standing up in front of the table in the
living room.
[
53
]
The numerous firearm magazines were found throughout
the apartment including 2 on the floor beside the kitchen island, 3 on the
floor by the bedroom window, and 4 on the bedroom floor behind the bed
headboard.  Each of these had visible cartridges (ammunition) protruding from
the magazine and had ammunition inside.
[
54
]
A 10-round loaded magazine was found in a
box in the bedroom closet.  A total of 7 magazines were found on top of a box
in the living room near an ammunition loader.  The extended magazine seen by Mr.
Grant was found on the floor in the living room near the balcony door, and
contained ammunition.  A box with 13 loose cartridges (loose ammunition) was
found in the living room on the floor.
[

The offence of careless storage of a firearm
requires that the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct of the
accused showed a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably
prudent person in the circumstances:

In
R. v. Blanchard
,
1994 CanLII 5251
,
Justice Manson of the Territorial Court of the Yukon considered the relevance
of regulatory requirements for the storage of firearms on a
Criminal Code
charge of careless storage and stated:
“I
conclude that the federal firearm storage regulations are relevant in
determining the appropriate standard for those who are transporting or storing
guns to the same degree that the rules of the road would be relevant in
determining the basic standard of conduct for drivers. Accordingly, in the
circumstances of this case, the court can commence the analysis of the
accused’s conduct even without any evidence establishing the appropriate
standard.”

Section 86(2)
of the
Criminal Code
is
a separate offence charging a breach of regulations under the
Firearms Act
for
the storage of firearms.

In
R. v. Finlay

Court interpreted the “careless storage” offence at the time,
s.86(2)
at that
time, which stated:
“Everyone
who, without lawful excuse, uses, carries, handles, ships, or stores any
firearm or ammunition in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions
for the safety of other persons,
(a) is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
(i) in the
case of a first offence, for a term not exceeding two years, and
(ii) in
the case of a second or subsequent offence, for a term not exceeding five
years; or
(b) is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”

In
R. v. Finlay
, supra
, Lamer, C.J.
stated with respect to Parliament’s intention in passing firearm control
legislation at pp. 115-117:
“By enacting s.
86(2), Parliament has seen fit to impose on all people owning or using firearms
a specific and rigorous duty of care.  It is a basic tenet of the
principles of fundamental justice that the state not be permitted to punish and
deprive of liberty the morally innocent.  Those who have the capacity to
live up to a standard of care and fail to do so, in circumstances involving
inherently dangerous activities, however, cannot be said to have done nothing
wrong.  The Law Reform Commission of Canada emphasized this point in the
following passage from
Workplace Pollution
, Working Paper 53
(1986), at pp. 2-73:
Certain kinds of activity involve the control of
technology (cars, explosives, firearms) with the inherent potential to do such
serious damage to life and limb that the law is justified in paying special
attention to the individuals in control.  Failing to act in a way which
indicates respect for the inherent potential for harm of those technologies,
after having voluntarily assumed control of them (no one
has
to
drive, use explosives, or keep guns) is legitimately regarded as criminal.
[Emphasis in original.]]
This Court has, in
the past, acknowledged Parliament's rationale in enacting gun control
offences.  Writing for the majority in
R. v.
Schwartz
,
1988 CanLII 11 (SCC)
, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
443, at p. 483, McIntyre J. stated the following:
The
Code
has
included provisions for the control, use and possession of firearms since the
enactment of the 1892
Criminal Code
, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s.
105.  That section prohibited the possession of pistols and air guns at
other than specific places and, as well, provided for exemptions from the
operation of the section.  Since that time, there have been successive
amendments which without exception have strengthened the controls upon
possession and use of firearms.
...
It is evident that
the strict control of handguns has been and remains an essential feature of the
Canadian gun control laws.
It is clear that
the overall intent of Parliament in enacting Part II.1 of the
Criminal Code
was to prohibit the
acquisition and use of weapons save in accordance with the strict controls it
prescribed.
In s. 86(2),
Parliament has addressed the threat posed by the use and storage of firearms by
rendering those whose conduct shows a marked departure from the standard of
care of a reasonably prudent person subject to criminal liability and possible imprisonment.  The
nature of the objective standard for the determination of fault was   concisely stated
by McLachlin J. in the case of
R. v. Hundal, supra
, in which she
stated the following (at p. 872):
... the question
is not what was in the accused's mind but the absence of the mental state of
care.  This want of due care is inferred from conduct of the
accused.  If that conduct evinces a want of care judged by the standard of
a reasonable person in similar circumstances, the necessary fault is
established.  The relevant circumstances may include circumstances
personal to the accused, relating to whether the accused lacked the capacities
or powers necessary to attain the mental state of care required in the
circumstances.
In
Hundal
,
this Court was unanimously of the view that, in the appropriate context,
negligence can be an acceptable basis of liability which meets the fault
requirement of
s. 7
of the
Charter
.
The objective test
for negligence is discussed in
R. v. Gosset
,
1993 CanLII 62 (SCC)
, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76,
released this same day.  In
Gosset
, I found that the proper
interpretation of the fault element under s. 86(2) is conduct that constitutes
a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent
person.  If a reasonable doubt exists either that the conduct in question did
not constitute a marked departure from that standard of care, or that
reasonable precautions were taken to discharge the duty of care in the circumstances,
a verdict of acquittal must follow....”.

On the facts of this case, the evidence is
clear that, apart from the trigger locks on 2 handguns, nothing was done within
the apartment where the firearms and ammunition were located, to make them
inaccessible to a person who entered the apartment, either to perform repairs,
as was the case on June 7, or who entered the apartment as an invitee, or
otherwise.
[
64
]
With respect to the Hi-Point handgun
referred to in count three, and each of the rifles referred to in counts 4, 5,
and 6, the firearms were totally accessible in the small apartment, along with
voluminous ammunition that was operable in each of the firearms.
[
65
]
Nothing was locked in any sort of secure
cabinet, or gun case, or ammunition case. This presented a real risk that the
available ammunition could be inserted into the available firearm by anyone who
accessed the apartment, whether invited or not, creating a substantial risk to
the public the provision was designed to prevent.
[
66
]
This is particularly the case given the fact
that the apartment was one of several hundred in a high-rise residential
apartment building, with other residential units on 19 floors, creating a
substantial risk to members of the public, including employees of the landlord,
or persons required to enter the apartment to make repairs, who may be present
from time to time in the apartment, as was the case on June 7, 2025.
[
67
]
The fact that each of the above firearms and
ammunition were present in that the apartment, with none being located in a
locked case, when each of the firearms was operable with operable ammunition
present nearby in the apartment, in magazines or boxes throughout the apartment,
without any protection from access by any person present, in my opinion amounts
to a marked departure  from the standard of care  a reasonably  prudent person
would take to ensure that these lethal weapons, with ammunition, were
reasonably inaccessible to persons who may access that apartment whether
invited or uninvited.
[
68
]
With respect to the Glock handgun in count 1
in the information, and the CZ P-10C handgun in count 2, each of these
restricted firearms had a trigger lock.  The Crown called no evidence to
suggest that such locks could be easily removed or otherwise rendered
ineffective.
[
69
]
On the totality of the evidence, I am not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the storage of these 2 firearms, with
a trigger lock on each, amounted to a marked  departure from the standard of
care of a reasonably prudent person living alone in a small apartment.
[
70
]
Accordingly, Mr. Banjaw is acquitted on
counts 1 and 2.
[
71
]
However, no other firearms had trigger
locks, they were all easily accessible, and they were in working order, with
operational ammunition nearby, that was also easily accessible.  Mr. Banjaw
admitted that he was the sole occupant of the apartment and the owner of the
firearms and ammunition found in the apartment.  I find that he was responsible
for the manner in which they were stored in his apartment.
[
72
]
In respect of the remaining firearms and
ammunition, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Banjaw’s storage
of these items showed a marked departure from the standard of care of a
reasonably prudent person, and in relation to these firearms and ammunition no
reasonable precautions were in place for the safety of other persons.
[
73
]
Accordingly, I find Mr. Banjaw guilty of the
offences charged in the information in counts 3 -11 inclusive.
