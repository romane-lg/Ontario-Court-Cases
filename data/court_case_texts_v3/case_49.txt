J.:
I. Introduction
[
1
]
This was a matter that I judicially pre-tried on
June 3, 2025. On September 12, 2025, Ahmed Hassan pleaded guilty to the offence
of operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by
alcohol, causing bodily harm to Jason Otieno, contrary to
section 320.14(2)
of
the
Criminal Code of Canada
. I ordered a pre-sentence report. I heard
sentencing submissions on November 5, 2025, and reserved my decision to today. 
These are my reasons.
[
2
]
The offence arises from a serious motor vehicle
collision on January 26, 2024, in Mississauga, which resulted in
life-threatening injuries to a passenger and significant property damage. The
court must impose a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the
offence and the degree of the offender's responsibility, consistent with the
principles set out in
sections 718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
.
II.
Facts
[
3
]
In support of the plea, Mr. Hassan admitted to
the following facts: On January 26, 2024, at approximately 1:50 a.m., he was
operating a silver 2020 Honda Civic northbound on Southdown Road in
Mississauga. The vehicle carried four passengers. While negotiating a turn from
Royal Windsor Drive, Mr. Hassan lost control, left the roadway, struck a
concrete light post, and the vehicle overturned. Mr. Hassan was extricated by
emergency services and transported to St. Michael’s Hospital with serious,
non-life-threatening injuries. The front passenger, Jason Otieno, sustained
life-threatening injuries. He was transported to St. Michael’s Hospital in critical
condition. Two other passengers suffered minor injuries, and one left the scene
without treatment.
[
4
]
Mr. Hassan’s blood was analyzed by the Centre of
Forensic Science, and at the time his blood was collected, his blood alcohol
concentration was 180 mg per of alcohol in 100 mL of blood, more than twice the
legal limit. He was later charged with impaired operation causing bodily harm
and related offences.
III.
Victim Impact
[
5
]
Jason Otieno describes profound physical, psychological, and emotional
consequences from the collision. He sustained permanent hearing loss, facial
nerve damage, and partial facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy), along with ongoing
weakness and numbness on his left side. His left eye tends to become lazy, and
he experiences chronic pain in his neck and back. Cognitive issues include
trouble concentrating and multitasking, which greatly affect his daily life.
Psychologically, he deals with irritability, mood swings, and trauma triggers,
especially when driving in conditions similar to the crash. Despite
physiotherapy and psychotherapy, these effects continue. He stresses feeling
betrayed by Mr. Hassan, who was once a close friend, and feels frustrated by
the lack of remorse. The victim hopes Mr. Hassan reflects on the impact of his
actions.
IV.
Positions of the Parties
A.
Crown Position
[
6
]
The Crown seeks a custodial sentence of six to
nine months, followed by 18 months of probation, with conditions for
counselling and a two-year driving prohibition. The Crown emphasizes
aggravating factors: the high blood alcohol level, the serious harm caused, and
the marked departure from the standard of care that a driver should have
adhered to. The Crown stresses denunciation and deterrence as primary
objectives.
B.
Defence Position
[
7
]
The Defence proposes a conditional sentence,
with strict conditions including house arrest and curfew. Mitigating factors
include the accused’s lack of prior criminal record, the guilty plea, and
significant rehabilitation efforts, including participation in Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) sessions, counselling, and confirmed sobriety. A positive pre-sentence report
supports his progress. The accused is a university student with a history of
employment and strong family support. He is the primary caregiver for his young
child. Defence cites
R. v. Creft
, (2022) ONCJ 572 in support of a
conditional sentence, arguing that the case involved more aggravating
circumstances.
V.
Personal Circumstances
[
8
]
Most of Mr. Hassan’s background information has
been gathered from the pre-sentence report.
[
9
]
Ahmed Hassan is a 24-year-old Canadian citizen
with no prior criminal record. He grew up in a stable, supportive family
environment, was one of six siblings, and currently resides with his mother and
siblings in Mississauga. His father works overseas as a lawyer but remains
involved in family life. Mr. Hassan shares custody of his three-year-old son
with his former girlfriend, whom he dated for six years. He describes his son
as his primary motivation for self-improvement. Educationally, Mr. Hassan
graduated from high school in 2018 and is now enrolled in an economics program
at university. He has prior work experience in retail and warehouse roles and
currently earns income through freelance web development, reporting
approximately $30,000 in savings.
[
10
]
Alcohol abuse was a significant factor in the
offence. Mr. Hassan began drinking at 17, but his consumption escalated
following the breakup with his girlfriend, leading to daily drinking for
several months. He admitted that alcohol was a major contributor to his
impaired driving offence. Mr. Hassan claims to have stopped drinking and
attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He reported occasional cannabis use but
denied dependency. There were mental health concerns noted in his life,
particularly emotional distress linked to his breakup and career setbacks.
However, Mr. Hassan has no formal diagnosis and meets regularly with a
psychotherapist.
[
11
]
Mr. Hassan expressed remorse for his actions,
acknowledging the harm caused and the role alcohol played. He presented as
cooperative and respectful during the interview and articulated goals focused
on education, business development, and parenting. His sister and ex-girlfriend
describe him as calm, intelligent, and non-aggressive. However, the police
expressed concern about a subsequent charge in May 2025, suggesting he may not
have fully internalized the consequences of his behaviour. Mr. Hassan maintains
strong family ties and a positive peer group, having distanced himself from
former friends who engaged in partying. He also volunteers at a local mosque
and engages in pro-social activities such as gym workouts and community
service.
[
12
]
The report concludes that Mr. Hassan appears
motivated to change and willing to comply with community-based sanctions.
However, substance use and mental health remain areas requiring intervention.
While his current risk level seems manageable, the pre-sentence report notes that
unresolved emotional issues and substance use could pose future risks if not
addressed.
VI.
Sentencing Framework
[
13
]
When the Crown proceeds summarily in a case of impaired operation
causing bodily harm, the maximum penalty is
imprisonment
for a term of not more than two years less a day
and/or a
fine
of not more than $5,000
.
VII.
Sentencing Principles
[
14
]
An impaired driver is a weapon on the road.
Courts across this country have held that sentences for offences that involve
impaired driving that cause bodily harm must convey society’s condemnation.
[
15
]
Justice Stribopoulos, in his recent decision in
R.
v. Jaison
,
[2025] O.J. No. 3202
, eloquently set out the principles at play
in cases that involve impaired driving causing bodily harm as follows:
22 Sentencing is discretionary by nature. There is no set
formula that judges can follow to decide the appropriate sentence. Instead,
judges must consider the purpose and objectives of sentencing, and be mindful
of the governing sentencing principles, especially the need to impose a
proportionate sentence. Against that backdrop, and after accounting for the
aggravating and mitigating factors, the sentencing judge must fashion a just
and appropriate sentence.
23
Sentencing judges must remember
the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which Parliament has identified as
protecting society and contributing "to respect for the law and the
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society":
Criminal
Code
, section 718.
24
Achieving that purpose requires
the court to impose "just sanctions" that reflect one or more
traditional sentencing objectives: see
Criminal Code
section
718. These include denunciation, general and specific deterrence, separation of
offenders from society, rehabilitation, reparation to victims, promoting a
sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledging the harm done to
victims and the community: see subsections 718(a) through (f).
25
Ultimately, the court must
respect the fundamental principle of sentencing: that any sentence "must
be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
of the offender":
Criminal Code
section
718.1. In other words, the sentence must fit both the seriousness of the crime
and the offender's level of moral blameworthiness in its commission;
R. v. Ipeelee
,
2012 SCC 13
,
[2012] 1 S.C.R. 433
, at paragraphs
36-37
,
R. v. Nasogaluak
,
2010 SCC 6
,
[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206
, at paragraphs
40-43
.
26
The principle of parity is an
essential consideration in arriving at a proportionate sentence.
Proportionality is a function of the circumstances of the offence and offender
compared to sentences previously imposed on similar offenders for similar
offences committed in similar circumstances. As the Supreme Court has
explained, a sentencing judge must reconcile individualization and parity to
achieve a proportionate sentence: see
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
,
[2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089
, at paragraph
53
, citing
Criminal Code
subsections 718.2(a) and (b). However,
they do not operate in tension: "parity is an expression of
proportionality":
R. v. Friesen
,
2020 SCC 9
,
[2020] 1 S.C.R. 424
, at paragraph
32
; see also at paragraphs
30-33 more generally; see also
R. v. Bissonnette
,
2022 SCC 23
,
80
C.R. (7th) 127
, at paragraph
51
.
……
[
16
]
His Honour set out the following regarding the
sentencing range for cases of this nature:
34  However, given the very serious nature of the
offence of impaired driving causing bodily harm and the resulting need for
sentences that prioritize general deterrence and denunciation, a sentencing
judge's options narrow considerably. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted
in Lacasse, at paragraph
6
:
While it is normal for trial judges to consider sentences
other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the instant case, as in all
cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized,
the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for meeting these
objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and
law-abiding society.
35  There is a wide range of sentences for
impaired driving causing bodily harm. At the low end are sentences in the
intermittent range: see R. v. Sinnarasa
(2005)
23 M.V.R. (5th) 279
(Ont. S.C.)
; R. v.
Rooplal,
2009 ONCJ 613
. In contrast, high reformatory or lower
penitentiary sentences tend to mark the upper boundary of the range: see R.
v. LaForme,
2014 ONCA 367
(18 months); R. v. Bulland,
2020 ONCA 318
(two years); R. v. Febbo,
2024 ONCA 267
, affirming
2023 ONCJ 162
(33 months); R. v. Gomes,
2022 ONCA 247
,
91 M.V.R. (7th) 103
(three years).
[
17
]
These are guidelines; not to be treated like
straitjackets. Sentencing is a highly individualized process.
VIII.
Aggravating and Mitigating Factors
[
18
]
Section 718.2 provides that a sentence should be
increased or decreased for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating
to the offence or the offender.
[
19
]
The aggravating factors in this case are
significant:
•
The offence involved impaired operation of a
motor vehicle causing bodily harm, which is inherently serious and attracts
strong principles of denunciation and deterrence. Mr. Hassan’s blood alcohol
concentration was 180 mg per 100 mL of blood, more than twice the legal limit,
indicating a high level of impairment. Section 320.22(e) of the
Code
provides
that it is an aggravating factor in sentencing where the offender has a blood
alcohol concentration of .120 or higher at the time of the offence.
•
Mr. Hassan’s manner of driving represented a
marked departure from the standard of care, as he was travelling at excessive
speed, lost control of the vehicle, and struck a concrete pole.
•
The consequences were severe: one passenger
sustained life-threatening injuries, which resulted in 40% permanent hearing
loss. The victim also suffers from severe psychological trauma. The victim’s
statement underscores the severity and permanence of harm, which is an
aggravating factor under s.718.2(a)(iii.1) of the
Criminal Code
. The
injuries are life-altering, affecting physical health, mental well-being, and
quality of life. This amplifies the need for denunciation and deterrence, as
impaired driving causing such harm represents a grave societal risk. The
betrayal element and ongoing psychological trauma further highlight the
profound personal impact, reinforcing the principle that sentencing must
acknowledge harm to victims and promote accountability.
•
Additionally, Mr. Hassan incurred a subsequent
alcohol-related driving charge in May 2025 for care and control over 80, which
raises concerns about ongoing risk and undermines the weight of his
rehabilitative efforts.
[
20
]
These factors collectively elevate the gravity
of the offence and the need for a sentence that reflects public safety and
accountability.
[
21
]
Conversely, there are notable mitigating factors
in this case:
•
He entered a guilty plea, demonstrating
acceptance of responsibility and contrition. He spared the administration the
cost of a trial. He has expressed remorse about the accident.
•
He has no prior criminal record and is therefore
a first-time offender.
•
Since the offence, he has undertaken meaningful
rehabilitative steps, including attending approximately 45 Alcoholics Anonymous
sessions, engaging with a sponsor, and participating in counselling with a
psychotherapist. He has provided evidence of sobriety screening and claims
abstinence from alcohol since May 2025.
•
He benefits from strong family support and actively
engages in parenting his young child. He is pursuing higher education in
economics, has constructive career aspirations, and volunteers at a local
mosque. His presentation during the pre-sentence report interview was
cooperative and respectful, and collateral sources describe him as calm,
intelligent, and non-aggressive.
[
22
]
These factors suggest genuine efforts toward
rehabilitation and reintegration.
IX.
Analysis and Decision
[
23
]
I
consider the Crown's request for a sentence of six to nine months' jail to be extremely
lenient. However, even applying the principle of restraint, I conclude that a
sentence of 12-18 months of incarceration is the appropriate range, consistent
with the principles of denunciation, general deterrence, specific deterrence,
and rehabilitation. It balances aggravating factors, such as the devastating
effect on the victim, with mitigating factors, such as Mr. Hassan’s strong
rehabilitative prospects.
X.
Conditional Sentence Availability
[
24
]
Having
determined that a reformatory sentence is fit, the prerequisites for a
conditional sentence set out in the
Criminal Code
are as follows:
1.
The sentence imposed is less
than two years (s.742.1).
2.
The offence is not
punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment (s.742.1(b)).
3.
The offence is not attempt
murder, torture or advocating genocide (s.742.1(c)); and
4.
The offence is not a
terrorism offence, or a criminal organization offence, prosecuted by
indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more
(s.742.1(d)).
[
25
]
The
Crown is seeking a sentence well under two years. Accordingly, a conditional
sentence is available.
XI.
Conditional Sentence Assessment
[
26
]
For
a conditional sentence to be appropriate, pursuant to s.742.1(a), I must be
satisfied that:
(a)
Mr. Hassan serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the
safety of the community; and
(b)
A conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose
and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.
Risk to the community:
[
27
]
In
R. v. Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5
at para.
68
, the Supreme Court of Canada
interpreted "safety of the community" to refer to the threat posed by
the specific offender were he to serve his sentence in the community.
[
28
]
The
proper approach in assessing risk to the community involves a consideration of
(1) the risk of the offender re-offending, and (2) the gravity of the damage
that could ensue in the event of re-offence. (See:
R. v. Proulx
, at
para.
69
.)
[
29
]
I
do not have concerns about the risk posed by Mr. Hassan. He has no prior
criminal record. He is stable in the community. He has positive community and
family support.  He has attended AA counselling while the charges have been
outstanding. He has engaged the services of a psychotherapist. He spends most
of his time going to school, working, volunteering at the mosque and parenting
his child.
[
30
]
Since
May 2025, Mr. Hassan has been effectively managed in the community while living
under stringent bail conditions, with no indication that he has breached any of
them.
[
31
]
I
believe that appropriate restrictive and rehabilitative conditions could be
included in a conditional sentence to minimize the risk Mr. Hassan may pose to
public safety.
[
32
]
Accordingly,
I conclude that public safety is not a basis on which a conditional sentence
should be rejected.
Purpose and Principles of Sentencing:
[
33
]
I
must consider whether a term of incarceration or a custodial sentence served in
the community would better address all the relevant sentencing objectives -
denunciation, deterrence, restraint, and rehabilitation.
[
34
]
A
lengthy conditional sentence with house arrest, ankle monitoring, and
counselling conditions could achieve the goals of specific deterrence and
rehabilitation.
[
35
]
In
my view, a conditional sentence would adequately address the paramount
sentencing objectives of general deterrence and denunciation that arise on the
facts of this case.  Paragraphs 102 and 107 of
R. v. Proulx
, have been
applied here:
Incarceration will usually provide more denunciation than a
conditional sentence, as a conditional sentence is generally a more lenient
sentence that a jail term of equivalent duration. That said, a conditional
sentence can still provide a significant amount of denunciation. This is
particularly so when onerous conditions are imposed, and the duration of the
conditional sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence that
would ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances.
…
Incarceration, which is ordinarily a harsher sanction, may
provide more deterrence than a conditional sentence. Judges should be wary,
however, of placing too much weight on deterrence when choosing between a
conditional sentence and incarceration...Moreover, a conditional sentence can
provide significant deterrence if sufficiently punitive conditions are imposed
and the public is made aware of the severity of these sentences. There is also
the possibility of deterrence through the use of community service orders...
[
36
]
A
conditional sentence, in this case, is consistent with the fundamental purpose
of sentencing. A conditional sentence can and will give effect to the paramount
objectives of sentencing.
[
37
]
I
have considered the decision in
R. v. Creft
, where Justice Pringle
imposed a 12-month conditional sentence for dangerous driving causing bodily
harm and failing to remain at the scene. In that case, the offender, a youthful
first-time offender, caused severe injuries and property damage while driving
recklessly without a licence and compounded his culpability by failing to
remain at the scene. Despite the seriousness of the harm, the court concluded
that a conditional sentence could meet the objectives of denunciation and
deterrence when structured with strict, punitive conditions, as outlined in
R.
v. Proulx
.
[
38
]
The
circumstances in the
Creft
case share similarities with this case: both
involve young, first-time offenders, serious bodily harm, and strong
rehabilitative prospects. While Mr. Hassan’s blood alcohol concentration and
subsequent charge are aggravating factors, his early guilty plea, remorse, and
documented rehabilitation efforts weigh heavily in mitigation. The
Creft
decision demonstrates that a community-based sentence can be appropriate for
serious driving offences where public safety is not endangered, and
rehabilitation is evident.
[
39
]
Mr.
Hassan will be permitted to serve his incarceration conditionally, in the
community. The conditions imposed upon him are designed to punish, to send a
message, to protect the community from further driving offences, and to assist
him in his continued rehabilitation.
XII.
Sentence
[
40
]
I assess the correct jail sentence for Mr.
Hassan to be 12 months. Because a conditional sentence is typically lengthened
to serve punitive interests, Mr. Hassan’s sentence will be 15 months to be
served in the community, followed by 18 months of probation.
Conditional Sentence Order

41
]
