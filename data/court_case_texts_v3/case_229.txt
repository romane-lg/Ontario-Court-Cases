BROWN,
B.A.,
J.:
BACKGROUND
[
1
]
On May 30, 2024, Mr. Mughal
entered a guilty plea to one count on a 13 count information, pertaining to
numerous offences in June 2023, in relation to a trafficking in motor
vehicle
investigation.
He
was
represented
by
counsel.
At
the
outset,
the
Crown
put on the record in open court that it
would proceed on a guilty plea on count 2, but read in all
of
the
facts
on
the
other
counts.
Defence
counsel
did
a
guilty
plea
enquiry
prior
to
the guilty plea. The court also did a
guilty plea enquiry.
The Crown
proceeded summarily. The
guilty
plea
related
to
possession
of
a
stolen
vehicle
valued
at
over
$5,000.00 relating to
single
offence
of
possession
of
a
stolen
vehicle
valued
at
over
$5,000.
Additional
facts were read
into
the
record, for
the
purpose
of
sentence.
Those
additional
facts related
to a police investigation related to trafficking in stolen
vehicles, which was believed to be related
to
the
rear
of
1830
Ellesmere
Road,
and
loaded
shipping
containers.
Surveillance was
conducted
at
that
location
on
June
13
and
June
14,
of
2023.
At
that
time,
Mr.
Mughal was
observed
to
be
present
during
the
loading
of
three
unidentified
vehicles
and
a
fourth
identified vehicle, into a shipping container.
The identified vehicle was a Toyota Highlander,
with
a
New
York
licence
plate,
reported
stolen
on
June
12,
2023
by
a
renter. The owner of the vehicle was
Enterprise Rent-a-Car.
This was the
vehicle that was the subject of the guilty plea.
[

]
Facts
were
read
in
related
to
the
additional
dates
of
surveillance
and
the
additional charges, for the purpose of sentence
related to the subject count.
In
summary various containers were driven away from this location on various dates
when Mr. Mughal was observed to be present, and later left the address.
The police were unable to get any
identifying numbers from the shipping containers, but the police were able to
get the licence plate of the tractor pulling the shipping container.
[

]
On
June
16,
2023,
more
observations
were
made
at
this
address.
Mr.
Mughal
was again
present
during
the
time
that
there
were
two
unidentified
vehicles
loaded
into
another
shipping container, and two identified stolen vehicles were also loaded into a
shipping container.
Police identified
a Toyota Highlander reported stolen
out
of York region June 12,
by
the
person
leasing
it,
and
a
second
Toyota
Highlander
reported
stolen
June
15
by
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
The
police
were
able
to
obtain
the
shipping
container
identifier numbers
for
both
crates,
which
were
driven
away
from
this
address.
It
was
flagged
for
the CBSA, to give the numbers
for the shipping containers.
[

]
Following that, on June 20, 2023,
police observed Mr. Mughal again present at 1830
Ellesmere,
during
the
loading
of
two
stolen
vehicles
into
a
shipping
container.
The first
vehicle
was
a
Lexus
RX
350,
reported
stolen
on
June
18
by
the
owner,
and
a
second Lexus RX 350, reported stolen on
June 18.
The police obtained the
shipping container identifier number and licence plate of the tractor hauling
it, which drove away on Ellesmere.
The
police then flagged this container number to the CBSA.
[
5
]
On June 23, 2023, more
observations were made at this same address on Ellesmere.
At that time, Mr. Mughal was again present
during the loading of two unidentified stolen vehicles into a shipping
container.
Police obtained the
shipping container identifying number, and it was driven away from the
Ellesmere location.
The container was
flagged for the CBSA.
[
6
]
Again, on June 29, 2023, police
surveillance continued at this location.
Once
again, Mr. Mughal was present as there were two unidentified vehicles present,
being loaded into another shipping container.
That container was also driven away from the address.
Mr. Mughal then walked away.
The police were unable to get any vehicle
identifiers
for
container.
It
was
later
identified
on
video
and
flagged
for
the
CBSA.
Police
continued surveillance
at the
location. Mr. Mughal again returned to
the
location at 1830 Ellesmere, when two unidentified vehicles were loaded into
another shipping container, and
he
subsequently
began
to
leave
on
foot
as
the
container
was
driven
away.
The
police stopped
the
container,
arrested
Mr.
Mughal
and
the
driver
of
the
truck
hauling
the
shipping
container.
[
7
]
During a search at the time of the
arrest of Mr. Mughal, of the stopped container, police
located
stolen
licence
plates
in
the
rear
of
a
Toyota
Highlander
from
a
vehicle
which had
been
reported
stolen
June
21,
2023
from
Ajax,
by
its
owner.
There
was
also
a
Toyota
Highlander reported stolen on May 7, 2023.
There
was also in the container a stolen 2022 Lexus RX 350, reported stolen from
Brampton by its owner on June 27.
In
the search
incident
to
arrest
of
Mr.
Mughal,
he
had
on
his
person
a
key
to a
flatbed
tow
truck
which
it
seems
was
not
the
truck
that
had
been
driven
and
stopped
by
the
police.
He
was released on an undertaking.
[
8
]
After all of the facts were read
in, the court specifically asked if the facts on the guilty plea were admitted,
and defence counsel admitted the facts on behalf of Mr. Mughal.
The
court
also
specifically
addressed
defence
counsel
as
to
whether
there
was an agreement to read
in all of the facts, and the defence advised the court that was the case.
As indicated, the facts were admitted and
the court made a finding of guilt.
[
9
]
The court was advised of the joint
submission of a conditional sentence of 6 months in duration, for sentence.
From that early stage the court alerted
counsel to its concern that the joint submission was too lenient, in light of
all of the facts.
The court requested
additional information and submissions from counsel arising from the court’s
consideration of
R. v. Anthony-Cook
,
2016 SCC 43
.
The court ordered a pre sentence report.
This report was prepared after some delay.
The court also sought further information,
including
facts
relating
to
the
losses
sustained
and
any
recovery
of
vehicles,
together with victim impact statements which had not been sought by the Crown,
as required
by
the
Criminal
Code.
There
was
another
appearance
upon
which
the
Crown
did
not provide that information.
[
10
]
On
December
5,
2024,
the
court
issued
an
order
pursuant
to
s.
723
of
the
Criminal
Code
,
arising from the court’s need to address
the test in
Anthony-Cook
as
to whether the proposed joint submission was insufficient, and would be
contrary to the public interest
and
bring
the
administration
of justice into
disrepute.
After
the
court
advised
the party of this order, defence counsel
advised the court that it would seek to bring an application
to
set
aside
the
guilty
plea.
The
court
noted
its
concern
that
as
a
judge
sitting in this court, it was impossible
to not be exposed to information as to the prevalence of this type of crime in
the community, and the enormous nature of the problem of vehicle theft in the
community.
The order issued by the
court related to the need to obtain information
to
put
before
the
court
as
to
the
nature
of
vehicle
theft
in
the
community.
This order
is
reported
at
R.
v.
Mughal,
2024
ONCJ
714
.
The
Crown
subsequently
provided
to the court
statistics, which are noted below as exhibits, in response to this order.
[
11
]
As noted, on the same date, defence counsel revealed
its intention to bring an application to set aside the guilty plea.
This application was heard, and the
decision of the court was reserved.
On
February 28, 2025, given the position of both parties, the court
maintained
the
guilty
plea.
However,
arising
from
the
extensive
defence
evidence,
including
the
affidavit
of
Mr.
Mughal
that
he
never
intended
to
agree
to
the
additional
facts for
the
purpose
of
sentence,
which
was
not
the
subject
of
cross-examination
or
challenge
by the Crown, the court ruled that it would not
be able to consider
those
additional facts. The
court
left
open
for
the
Crown
the
opportunity
to
call
evidence
which
would
need
to
be proven,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
for
the
additional
counts.
The
Crown
has
chosen
to call
no
additional
evidence,
and
essentially
to
have
Mr.
Mughal
sentenced
only
in
relation to
the
subject
count
for
the
guilty
plea,
and
not
consider
the
additional
facts
and
charges.
No additional facts are to be considered by this court, notwithstanding
the prior reading into the record of those facts.
[
12
]
The
case
was
put
over
to
March
24,
2025
for
sentence
and
further
submissions
by counsel were made.
On
that date the court
sought to
have
a
short
remand for
sentence to imposed.
However, the court was advised by defence
counsel that since it was Ramadan,
and
Mr.
Mughal
is
Muslim,
he
wished
to
have
the
sentence
adjourned
until after Ramadan, after April 11, 2025.
Accordingly, the court adjourned sentence to April 24, 2025.
[
13
]
On
April
24,
2025,
the
court
was
advised
by
defence
counsel
that
Mr.
Mughal
had been shot and that he was unable to attend court that date.
The case was put over for
sentence.
[
14
]
Mr. Mughal suffered a series of
gunshot wounds and he was admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center on
March 31, 2025.
He remained in
hospital until April
5,
2025,
under
the
care
of
Dr.
Matthew
Guttman,
trauma
surgeon.
While
the
nature of
those
injuries
are
somewhat
unclear
to
this
court
based
upon
the
information
provided to the court, the
court has determined he had trauma surgery, and that the injuries including the
following:
*Gunshot
wound
to
left
anterior
chest
wall,
and
T3
and
T4
compression
fractures
*Left
knee
gunshot
wound,
and
fracture
secondary
to
the
gunshot
wound;
and
*Right
knee
gunshot
wound
and
fracture;
and
*Right
leg
below
knee
gunshot
wound.
[
15
]
Mr.
Mughal
has
had
ongoing
physiotherapy,
orthopedic
surgery,
fracture
clinic
and pain specialty
treatment, together with social work and psychiatry treatment which is ongoing.
He has completed his occupational therapy.
[
16
]
Given the prior ruling, the court
will now impose a sentence upon Mr. Mughal for count
2,
in
relation
to
his
attendance
at
the
lot
on
June
13,
2023,
and
being
in
possession
of
this
stolen
vehicle
which
was
the
property
of
Enterprise
Rent-a-Car.
The
court
will
not
consider
in
any
way
the
additional
days
of
surveillance
and
the
additional stolen
vehicles put
in
shipping
containers
and
removed
from
the
lot,
given
the
position
of
the
parties
and the ruling of the court following the application to set aside the
guilty plea.
THE
FACTS
A.
Circumstances
of
the
offence
[
17
]
As set out above, the court will
consider the following facts relating to count 2, which is the guilty plea
entered in this case.
There was a
police investigation related to trafficking in stolen vehicles, which was
believed to be related to the rear of 1830 Ellesmere Road, and loaded shipping
containers.
Surveillance was
conducted at that location
on
June
13
of
2023.
At
that
time,
Mr.
Mughal
was
observed
to
be
present
during the loading of a vehicle into a shipping container.
The identified vehicle was a Toyota
Highlander,
with
a
New
York
licence
plate,
reported
stolen
on
June
12,
2023
by
a
renter. The
owner
of
the
vehicle
was
Enterprise
Rent-a-Car.
A
container
with
this
stolen
vehicle
inside
was
driven
away
by
a
tractor
trailer
from
this
location,
Mr.
Mughal
was
observed
to leave the address.
The police were unable to get any
identifying numbers from the shipping
container,
but
were
able
to
get
the
licence
plate
of
the
tractor
pulling
the
shipping
container.
[
18
]
The defence takes the position
that Mr. Mughal was a “middle man”, not involved in stealing the vehicle, and
that he did not control what happened after the vehicle was loaded into a
shipping container.
His role was to
move the vehicle into the shipping
container.
B.
Circumstances
of
the
Offender
[
19
]
The pre sentence report prepared
for
Mr.
Mughal in the fall
of 2024 is
helpful. Mr. Mughal has no prior criminal record.
He is single, a Canadian citizen, and he was born March
8,
1995.
Accordingly
he
is
currently
30
years
of
age.
He
has
no
dependents.
He lives with his parents and two younger
siblings.
Two older siblings
currently live independently.
His
parents are
devout Muslims
who
raised their
family
following Islamic principles.
Mr. Mughal is not indigenous.
[
20
]
As
a
child,
Mr.
Mughal
had
a
stutter.
He
was
the
subject
of
teasing
by
his
siblings, and at school.
It was difficult for others to understand
him and they ridiculed him.
He
sometimes
responded
to
this
by
violence.
In
2008
or
2009,
arising
from
difficulties
getting along with his siblings, his
parents placed him in a group home, and following that he went to a foster
home.
His parents visited him once a
month when he was in the group home. After a 3 month initial adjustment period
he described his time there in positive terms.
After
8
or
9
months
in
the
foster
home,
he
ran
away
as
he
missed
his
family.
After he took a program dealing with anger
management in July 2011 he moved back to live with his family.
[
21
]
Mr. Mughal spoke about his parents
in a favourable manner.
He has a
closer relationship
with
his
mother,
and
the
relationship
with
his
father
has
improved
over
time.
No one in his family is
aware of the
fact he is charged with this offence.
He
worries that he may be evicted and that his relationship with his parents might
be permanently damaged
if
they
find
out
about
this
criminal
charge.
He
was
not
in
a
relationship
and
his
parents have indicated their desire that he have an arranged marriage.
[
22
]
Mr. Mughal did not complete high
school. He is two credits short of
getting
a high school diploma.
He has taken
English as a second language classes.
He
attended an adult learning centre, and then Centennial College for a one year
auto body repair techniques
program.
He is currently receiving financial
support
through Ontario Works.
Currently he is working as an apprentice electrician.
He has worked in that position on and off for five years.
He has had other types of employment in
the past.
[
23
]
Substance
abuse
is
a
problem
for
Mr.
Mughal
according
to
his
pre
sentence
report. He has been drinking since he was 15 or 16 years of age, and currently
consumes a Mickey (375 ml.) of vodka or tequila every other day.
He also drinks cough syrup, and prefers
that to alcohol.
His parents are
unaware that he consumes alcohol or has consumed
drugs.
In
the
past
he
consumed
cocaine,
opioids
and
MDMA.
He
still
smokes marihuana every other day.
He
indicated a willingness to attend for counselling for this issue
if
ordered
by
the
court.
The
author
of
the
pre
sentence
report
noted
that
Mr.
Mughal
might
benefit
from
a
mental
health
assessment
to
address
any
issues
from
his
childhood.
[
24
]
As
it
relates
to
the
offence,
Mr.
Mughal
stated
that
he
is
very
sorry
for
his
behaviour.
He
said
he
tried
to
take
a
short
cut
and
it
didn’t
work
out.
He
said
he
will
never
make
the same mistake again.
It appears that he does not have a lot of
friends.
He attends the mosque
regularly and religion is a big part of his life.
He does not have any physical health
issues.
Mr.
Mughal
did
not
provide
any
collateral
source
information
for
preparation of
the
pre
sentence
report.
The
victim
advised
the
author
of
the
pre
sentence
report
that he
has
had
a
significant
increase
in
his
insurance
because
of
the
incident.
It
appears
at least
from
the
pre
sentence
report
that
there
was
an
additional
business
loss
which
arose from the contents in the vehicle
being
stolen.
The court notes
that this is an offence of possession and not theft of the vehicle.
[
25
]
Defence
counsel
has
obtained
a
GPS
assessment
which
confirms
that
Mr.
Mughal is
suitable
for
consideration
of
electronic
monitoring
in
the
event
that
is
ordered
as
part
of a conditional sentence.
C.
Impact
on
victim
and/or
community
[
26
]
There
was
no
victim
impact
statement
submitted
by
the
Crown
in
this
case.
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
offence
of
theft
of
motor
vehicles
has
become
a
very
serious
issue
in this community, as
set out below in the statistics described below.
LEGAL
PARAMETERS
[
27
]
Punishment for the offence of
stolen property over $5,000, where
the
Crown proceeded summarily as in this case, is set out in
s. 787
of the
Criminal
Code
.
The maximum punishment is a
fine of not more than $5,000. or to a term of imprisonment of not more than two
years less a day, or to both.
POSITIONS
OF
CROWN
AND
DEFENCE
ON
SENTENCE
[
28
]
The Crown and defence maintain a
joint submission put before the court is appropriate
in
this
case.
They
have submitted
that
a
conditional
sentence,
six
months
in length, with the first three months being a house arrest term, and
the remaining three months
being a
curfew
term,
together
with other
conditions is
appropriate.
There is
also a submission that there be a term of
probation to follow the conditional sentence.
MITIGATING
AND
AGGRAVATING
FACTORS
[
29
]
An
important
mitigating
factor
is
that
Mr.
Mughal
has
entered
a
guilty
plea,
and
that he has no
prior
criminal
record.
He has also indicated his
remorse.
He is thirty years
of age.
Counsel have not referred to any aggravating factors in this case.
SENTENCING
PRINCIPLES
–
ANALYSIS
[
30
]
The
court
bears
in
mind
guiding
comments
of
the
Supreme Court
of
Canada in
R.
v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64 (CanLII)
,
[2015]
S.C.J. No. 64
.
In that judgment, the
Court stated that sentencing ranges are primarily guidelines, not hard and fast
rules.
Even if an appellate court has
established
a
range,
it
may
be
that
a
fact
pattern
may
arise
which
is
sufficiently
dissimilar to
past
decisions
that
the
range
must
be
expanded.
Sentencing
ranges
are
nothing
more than summaries of the minimum and
maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as guides
for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives. However,
they should not be considered "averages", let alone straitjackets,
but should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing
judges, who must
still
exercise
their
discretion
in
each
case.
Accordingly,
a
sentencing
range
is
not
a
straitjacket to the exercise of discretion of a
sentencing judge.
Each
crime is committed in
unique
circumstances
by
an
offender
with
a
unique
profile.
Everything
depends
on
the gravity of the offence, the
offender's degree of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each
case.
Sentencing ranges must in all
cases remain only one tool among others that are intended to aid trial judges
in their work.
[
31
]
In
2010,
the
SCC
noted
in
R.
v.
Nasogaluak
,
2010 SCC 6 (CanLII)
,
[2010]
1
S.C.R.
206
(S.C.C.)
,
at
para.
43
, that "[n]o one sentencing
objective trumps the others and it falls to the sentencing judge to determine
which objective or objectives merit the greatest weight, given the particulars
of the case."
[
32
]
Sentencing is highly
individualized,
see
R. v. Suter
,
2018 SCC 34
.
As the court stated in para. 4:
A delicate balancing of the
various sentencing principles and objectives is called for, in line with the
overriding principle that a "sentence must be proportionate to the
gravity
of
the
offence
and
the
degree
of
responsibility
of
the
offender"
(s.
718.1 of
the
[page
507]
Criminal
Code
).
Accordingly,
there
will
be
cases
where
the
particular
circumstances of the offence and/or the offender call for a sentence that falls
outside of the normal sentencing range. This is one such case.
[
33
]
In 2021,
The Supreme Court of
Canada in
R. v. Parranto
,
2021 SCC 46 (CanLII)
,
[2021] SCJ No. 46
, in the majority judgment at
para 10, held that proportionality is the organizing principle for the
court
in
imposing
a
fair,
fit
and
principled
sentence.
Proportionality
is
the
fundamental principle.
Sentences must be proportionate to the
gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, and
the unique circumstances of each case. Parity and individualization
are
important,
yet
secondary
principles. The
demands
of
proportionality must be
calibrated by reference to the sentences imposed in other cases.
Individualization is central to the assessment of proportionality in that it
demands consideration of the individual circumstances of each offender, as set
out in para. 12.
[
34
]
The principle of proportionality
is also codified in the
Criminal Code
, which states that
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
court
must
be
proportionate
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (see
718.1 of the
Criminal Code
).
[
35
]
Further the court bears in mind
that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect
society
and
to
contribute,
along
with
crime
prevention
initiatives,
to
respect
for
the
law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just
sanctions that have one or more of the objectives of denunciation, deterrence
(both generally and specifically for the offender), separation of the offenders
from society where necessary, rehabilitation, to provide reparation for
harm done to victims or to the community,
and to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of
the harm done to
victims
or
to
the
community
(see
s.
718
of
the
Criminal
Code
).
The
court
bears
in
mind any applicable sentencing principles
as set out in
s. 718.2
, and as well the principles of parity, totality and
judicial restraint in considering a sentence of deprivation of liberty or
imprisonment, as set out in
s. 718.2
(b) through (e).
The emphasis of the court in considering those various objectives
depends on the nature of the offence, and the circumstances of an offender.
Nature
of
Offence
–
The
problem
of
vehicle
theft
in
Toronto
[
36
]
As noted above, this case was part
of a police investigation into the theft and trafficking of stolen motor vehicles.
It has become a problem of great notoriety
in our community, as this court has seen as a front line judge dealing with
these cases on a regular basis.
[
37
]
In
response
to
the
court’s
Order
to
the
Crown
to
provide
the
court
with
information as
to
the
nature
of
vehicle
theft
in
the
community,
the
Crown
has
tendered
exhibits
which this
court
considers
regarding
this
offence
in
2023.
As
it
relates
to
Toronto,
the
court
has been provided with the following
information:
The number of
vehicles stolen in Toronto, as provided by the Hold Up unit of the Toronto
Police
Service,
has
increased
dramatically
from
2020
to
2023.
The
court also
sought
information
regarding
the
average number
of
vehicles
stolen
per
day, and per hour,
together with the number of recovered vehicles.
The information provided was as follows:
Year
Total
Stolen
Average
of
Vehicles
Stolen
per
day:
Average of
vehicles
stolen
per
hour:
Recovered
over
year:
2020
5,734
15.7
0.65
2,738
2021
6,420

0.73
2,865
2022
9,472

1.08
4,296
2023
11,829
32.4
1.35
6,028
[
38
]
Over this period of time, each
year the problem of vehicle theft has increased. While the police have had some
success in increasing the rate of recovery of stolen vehicles,
from an average of
47.75%
recovery in
2020,
to
a high of
50.1%
in
2023,
there is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
very
challenging
type
of
crime
to
solve
and
obtain
recovery.
The statistics from 2024, following the
date of the offence in this case, has shown a slight decrease
in
the
nature
of
this
crime,
with
a
total
of
8,593
vehicles
stolen,
being
an
average of 23.5 per day, 0.98 per hour,
with an overall recovery of 4,750 vehicles, resulting in a recovery rate of
approximately 55.3%.
[
39
]
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
problem
of
vehicle
theft
has
become
an
epidemic
in
this
community, one which has resulted in huge property losses suffered by the
community, whether insurance companies and potentially vehicle owners as well.
It is a cost that is borne
by
the
community
for
the
costly
losses.
Offenders
who
are
involved
in
the
theft
and trafficking
of vehicles
should, in the court’s
consideration of
the
appropriate
sentence
for the
nature
of
the
offence,
be
held
to
account
for
this
in
receiving
a
proportionate
sentence for this crime.
[
40
]
The data from the Toronto Police
Service did not include a value of the vehicles stolen, but
the
Toronto
Police Service
used an
average
Canadian new vehicle
price of $66,422,
from
2024,
not
adjusted
by
year.
The
figures
above
could
be
used
to
calculate
the total loss from these thefts and recoveries for each of the above years,
based on a 2024 average price.
[
41
]
The
Toronto
Police
Service
has
engaged
in
a
response
to
this
very
serious
crime. The information provided
indicated that starting in 2022, the Toronto Police
Service recognized the considerable increase in the amount of vehicle crimes
affecting the residents of Toronto.
In
June of 2022, the Toronto Police Service’s Hold Up Squad launched
a
dedicated
unit
to
deal
with these
crimes.
This
sub unit
of the Hold Up
squad was eventually amalgamated into the Provincial Carjacking
Task Force which ran from September 2023 until March of 2024.
This robust unit required a staffing of 60
people and included numerous vehicles, computers, police radios, overtime
budgets and administrative supplies.
An
interim carjacking task force ran in Toronto between March of
2024
and
June
of
2024.
In
June
of
2024,
the
Toronto
Police
Hold
Up
Squad
expanded its
mandate
and
took
all
auto
related
crimes.
This
required
an
increase
to
staffing,
budget and administrative tasks.
The police service did not release the
amount of money required
to
finance
this
police
work.
It
has
resulted
in
an
increased
workload
for
members of
Hold
Up,
and
all
the
internal
services
that
support
their
investigations
such
as
Forensic Identification Services.
[
42
]
The Toronto Police Service advised
that York Regional Police and Peel Regional Police have also had to expand
their offices to deal with the increase in auto related
occurrences.
[
43
]
The
Toronto
Police
Service
advised
that
in
August
of
2024,
the
Province
of
Ontario
purchased
5
new
helicopters
for
the
Greater
Toronto
Area
and
Ottawa,
at
a
cost
of
$134 Million, to in part combat auto
crimes.
[
44
]
In
response
to
the
court’s
query
as
to
the
police
investigations
into
multiple
vehicle thefts, and parties charged involved at the level of organizing
the schemes of stealing vehicles,
moving
them
to
other
locations,
and
transporting
them
to
other
parts
of
Canada and outside Canada to other
countries, the court has been advised that these investigations
and
prosecutions
are
currently
at
their
infancy,
and
that
many
of
the
cases
are presently before the courts.
[
45
]
There is no doubt that this type
of crime has cause a huge loss to our community and
occasioned
a
response
by
police
services
and
the
provincial
government,
which
has required spending a great deal of
money to respond to the needs of enforcement, investigation and prosecution for
these crimes.
Joint
Submission
[
46
]
A critical factor for this court relates to the joint
submission of counsel put before the court. The seminal
Supreme Court
of
Canada case dealing with joint submissions of counsel is
R. v. Anthony Cook
,
2016 SCC 43
.
[
47
]
As noted
at
the outset
of the court’s consideration of
the
issues,
in
paras
1 and
2,
Moldaver, J. stated for the court:
(1)
…  Resolution discussions between Crown and defence
counsel are not only commonplace in the criminal justice system, they are
essential.
Properly conducted, they
permit the system to function smoothly and efficiently.
(2)
Joint
submissions
on
sentence
—
that
is,
when
Crown
and
defence
counsel agree to recommend a particular
sentence to the judge, in exchange for the accused
entering
a
plea
of
guilty
—
are
a
subset
of
resolution
discussions.[1]
They are
both
an
accepted
and
acceptable
means
of
plea
resolution.
They
occur
every day in courtrooms across this
country and they are vital to the efficient operation of the criminal justice
system.
As this Court said
in
R.
v. Nixon
,
2011 SCC 34
,
[2011]
2
S.C.R.
566
,
not
only
do
joint
submissions
“help
to
resolve
the
vast
majority of
criminal
cases
in
Canada”,
but
“in
doing
so,
[they]
contribute
to
a
fair
and
efficient
criminal justice system” (para. 47)
[
48
]
There
is
no
doubt
that
when
counsel
put
before
the
court
a
joint
submission,
a
trial judge is not
to determine what a fit sentence would be and then impose that sentence instead
of the joint submission.
A trial
judge is not obliged to go along with a joint submission.
However, a trial judge, as stated in para
32 of
Anthony Cook
, should not depart from a joint submission on sentence
unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest. A joint submission
should not be rejected lightly.
The
court stated, at para 34:
(34)…
Rejection
denotes
a
submission
so
unhinged
from
the
circumstances
of
the offence and the
offender
that its
acceptance would lead reasonable
and informed persons, aware of all the
relevant circumstances, including the importance of promoting
certainty
in
resolution
discussions,
to
believe
that
the
proper
functioning of the justice system had broken down.
This is an undeniably high threshold — and
for good reason…
[
49
]
The court also considers the
subsequent Supreme Court of Canada
case of
R
v Nahanee
,
2022 SCC 37 (CanLII)
,
[2022] SCJ No. 37
.
At
the Court of Appeal level, the court considers the Ontario Court of Appeal
cases of
R. v. Myles
,
[2017] O.J. NO. 2311
.
R. v. Augustine
,
[2019]

,

ONCA
115
and
R.
v.
Blake-Samuels
,
2021 ONCA 77
.
[
50
]
The court identified its concern
with the joint submission at the time of the guilty plea
and submissions
of
counsel
as to sentence.
At
that
time,
the
court’s concern
arose
from the extensive additional facts which were read into the record, to be
considered as aggravating for the imposition of a proportionate sentence for
this offender, and this offence.
That
triggered
the
Order
of
the
court
to
have
the
Crown
obtain
the
additional
information set out above, and ultimately the defence application to set aside
the guilty plea.
While the court did
not set aside the guilty plea, the court carefully considered the evidentiary
record
of
the
applicant
regarding
the
understanding
of
Mr.
Mughal
at
the
time
of the guilty plea, and his direction throughout that additional facts were not
to be admitted.
Ultimately
the
court
ruled
that
based
upon
the
evidence
in
that
application,
the court would not consider the additional facts, leaving open
for the Crown the potential procedure of proving any additional facts it sought
to rely upon as aggravating for sentence.
The
Crown has chosen to not avail itself of that procedure, and accordingly the
offence under consideration relates solely to the one vehicle on the one date,
which formed the basis of the guilty plea.
Characteristics
of
offender
[
51
]
Mr. Mughal is a first time
offender, 30 years of age.
The
principle of judicial restraint
as
set
out
in
s.
718.2
of
the
Criminal
Code
is
important.
The
court
considers
the combination of
R. v. Proulx
¸
2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)
,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 61
together with
the prior Ontario Court of Appeal
decision in
R. v. Priest
1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA)
,
[1996], OJ
No. 3369
, together with
R. v. Stein
(1974),
1974 CanLII 1615 (ON CA)
,
15 C.C.C. (2d) 376
, at p.
377
and
R. v. Batisse
(2009),
2009 ONCA 114 (CanLII)
,
93
O.R. (3d) 643
, at
paras
32
to
34
.
It is clear that the court must exercise restraint for a first offender, and in
particular all sanctions
apart
from
incarceration.
Where
incarceration
is
imposed,
it
should
be
as
short as possible and tailored to the
individual circumstances
of the
accused, and also in light of the need for rehabilitation.
[
52
]
The court would also note that
currently Mr. Mughal is recovering from very significant injures he has
sustained when he was the victim of gunshots, while in the community.
That
is
now
an
additional
factor
for
this
court
to
consider
in
the
imposition
of sentence as it relates to the impact of any sentence imposed
upon him.
Currently the court is
advised that he is not generally mobile, he has not been able to walk freely
for quite
some
time.
Today
he
is
appearing
remotely,
on
zoom,
given
his
inability
to
travel
to
court.
Conditional
sentence
[
53
]
As
set
out
above,
the
Crown
and
defence
have
jointly
submitted
that
a
conditional sentence
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
The
court
considers
the
requirements
of
s.
742.1
of
the
Criminal Code
.
The
sentence under consideration does not exceed two years, and is not subject to a
minimum term of imprisonment.
Mr.
Mughal has not been charged with breaching any terms of bail in this case.
[
54
]
A
key question is whether a conditional sentence would satisfy the
fundamental purpose, principles and objectives of sentencing, as set out in
ss.
718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
, for this offence and this offender.
Courts have been clear that in some cases,
a conditional
sentence
may
satisfy
the
principles
of
denunciation
and
deterrence;
R. v. Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)
,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 61
, at paras
102 and 107
,
R. v.
Wismayer
(1997),
1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA)
,
33 O.R. (3d)
225
(C.A.)
.
As
noted
by
Justice
Doherty
in
R.
v.
Killam
,
1999 CanLII 2489 (ON CA)
,
[1999]
O.J.
No.
4289
(C.A.)
,
a conditional sentence does not, generally speaking, have the same denunciatory
effect as a period of imprisonment;
incarceration remains the most formidable denunciatory weapon in the sentencing
arsenal.
[
55
]
In
Proulx
,
at
para.
96
,
the
Supreme
Court
specifically
considered
the
principle
and objective
of
judicial
restraint,
pursuant
to
s.
718.2
(d),
that
is
to
say,
that
an
offender
should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be
appropriate in the circumstances. However, the court stated that this
principle, is of course, not solely determinative, but involves a more
comprehensive consideration.
As
stated in that paragraph, “a determination of when less restrictive sanctions
are "appropriate" and alternatives to incarceration
"reasonable" in the circumstances requires a consideration of the
other
principles
of sentencing set
out in
ss. 718
to
718.2
.
So this is but one
of the
principles
and
objectives
to
consider.
The
court
must
have
regard
to
both
the
seriousness
of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.
Sentence
imposed
[
56
]
In
this
case,
the
joint
submission
and
the
principles
outlined
in
Anthony-Cook
play a
key role in the court’s consideration of the appropriate sentence for this
offender and for this offence
.
The
court considers whether the joint submission of a conditional sentence of six
months duration, the first half of which is house arrest with some exceptions,
and the last half of which is a period of curfew with very limited exceptions,
to be followed by a period of 2 years probation, would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest.
Would reasonable and informed persons,
aware of the relevant circumstances, including the circumstances of this
involving
one
isolated
offence,
committed
by
an
offender
with
no
prior
criminal
record and
various
mitigating
circumstances
outlined
in
the
pre
sentence
report, believe
that
the proper functioning of the justice
system had broken down if a six month conditional sentence with GPS monitoring,
to be followed
by a period of
probation were imposed as sentence for
this case? The court finds that this high threshold is not met in this case,
given
the
nature
of
the
modification
of
the
facts
after
the
application,
and
the
subsequent very significant gunshot wounds
and concurrent injuries that he has recently sustained while in the community
awaiting sentence.
[

]
Accordingly, this court imposes a
six month conditional sentence, with GPS monitoring for the whole period.
The first three months of the conditional
sentence will involve house arrest, with limited exceptions which the court
will outline in court, orally. The last three months of the conditional
sentence will involve a curfew, with even more limited exceptions.
This will be followed by a period of 2
years probation, with terms including reporting to a probation officer within
three business days and thereafter as required,
to
reside
at
an
address
approved
of
by
probation,
to attending
for
assessments and
counselling
for
substance
dependency
and
mental
health
issues,
and
to
sign
releases to monitor those appointments,
to seek employment or attend job training programs as directed by probation, to
not attend or be within 100 meters of 1830 Ellesmere Road, Toronto, to
not be in possession of any conveyance
(which includes any vehicle) not lawfully registered in your own legal name,
and to not associate with persons known to the offender to have a criminal
record.
[
58
]
The victim fine shall not be
imposed for this offence, in light of the fact that Mr. Mughal
is
still
recovering
from
his
extensive
gunshot
wounds
and
is
not
currently
working.
