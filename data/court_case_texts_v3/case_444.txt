ROBINSON J.:
INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
On 27 September 2024, I found Marlon Johnson
guilty after trial of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm (s.95(1)
CC
),
possession of a prohibited firearm knowing its possession is unauthorized
(s.92(1)
CC
) and possession of a firearm contrary to a prohibition order
(s.117.01(1)
CC
).
[
2
]
On 15 January 2025, counsel provided me with sentencing
submissions, accompanied by supporting materials and case law.
THE OFFENCES
[
3
]
In the early morning hours of 20 October 2022, Jide
Animashaun and Marlon Johnson left the 2020 Lounge and got into Mr.
Animashaun’s Mercedes. As the Mercedes being driven by Mr. Animashaun travelled
south on Weston road toward Highway 7, a vehicle pulled up on the passenger
side and its occupant(s) opened fire.
[
4
]
Mr. Animashaun suffered a gunshot wound to his
right wrist and hand. Mr. Johnson was shot in his right shoulder.
[
5
]
Mr. Animashaun and Mr. Johnson fled the now
disabled Mercedes on foot, called 9-1-1 and awaited the arrival of first
responders. They were transported to the hospital for treatment.
[
6
]
A number of hours later, informed by security
video footage in the area of the shooting, police officers located a loaded
Smith & Wesson M & P Bodyguard 380 handgun that Mr. Johnson had discarded
in a grassy area before the arrival of first responders.
[
7
]
Both Mr. Animashaun and Mr. Johnson were
arrested and charged with respect to the prohibited firearm. At the time, Mr.
Johnson was subject to a weapons prohibition order made on 17 April 2019. After
a trial that included various
Charter
applications, I found Mr.
Animashaun not guilty and Mr. Johnson guilty.
THE OFFENDER
[
8
]
Mr. Johnson is a 30 year old Black male, who was
28 at the time of the offence.
[
9
]
He has a criminal record: on 17 April 2019, he
was convicted of break and enter and sentenced to a six-month conditional
sentence followed by 12 months of probation.
[
10
]
Mr. Johnson grew up in the troubled Mount Olive
neighbourhood with his mother and two sisters. He recalls the area having a
heavy gang presence with frequent shootings. He is familiar with people from
the neighbourhood who have been injured or killed by gun violence. This
backdrop instilled in Mr. Johnson a sense of anxiety regarding his safety.
[
11
]
Mr. Johnson’s mother worked at various jobs to
support her family, but it was not sufficient to allow the family to overcome
poverty. However, this changed when Mr. Johnson turned 17, when his mother
started a clothing business and moved the family to a safer neighbourhood in Brampton.
[
12
]
Despite relocating to Brampton, Mr. Johnson’s
environment during his formative years left him with a strong distrust for the
criminal justice system, limited financial opportunities and an underlying
concern for his safety. Counsel for Mr. Johnson submits that these complex
factors contributed toward Mr. Johnson’s decision to arm himself.
[
13
]
Mr. Johnson has been in a relationship with Serenity
Nichol for three years. They are parents to a daughter who is eight months old.
Ms. Nichol submitted a reference letter describing Mr. Johnson as a caring and
attentive partner and father.
[
14
]
Similarly, letters were submitted by Mr.
Johnson’s mother Gillianne Fuller, his sister Crystal Bishop and his other
sister Shanyece Muswah. Collectively, they describe Mr. Johnson as a tremendous
source of support and a good person.
[
15
]
I also received a letter of support from
Robinson Akintade, Executive Vice-President of the Brampton Minor Football
Association, where Mr. Johnson volunteered his time for the last few years.
[
16
]
Finally, Pastor Keaton Austin of the Young Lives
Matter Outreach Ministry provided a character letter describing Mr. Johnson’s
invaluable volunteer work with his organization.
POSITIONS ON SENTENCE
[
17
]
It is agreed that Mr. Johnson spent nine days in
custody as a result of these charges; with
Summers
credit, this is the
equivalent of 14 days of pre-sentence custody.
[
18
]
The Crown seeks a global sentence of four years (less
credit for pre-sentence custody) apportioned as follows:
•
3 years on the s.95(1)
CC
offence;
•
3 years concurrent on the s.92(1)
CC
offence;
and
•
1 year consecutive on the s.117.01(1)
CC
offence.
[
19
]
The defence submits that, when due consideration
is given to the sentencing principles of rehabilitation, restraint and
reintegration, as well as the reduced moral culpability of Mr. Johnson pursuant
to
R. v. Morris
,
2021 ONCA 680
, a global sentence of 2.5 years (less
credit for pre-sentence custody) is appropriate, broken down as follows:
•
2 years on the s.95(1)
CC
offence;
•
2 years concurrent on the s.92(1)
CC
offence;
and
•
6 months consecutive on the s.117.01(1)
CC
offence.
PURPOSE & PRINCIPLES OF
SENTENCING
[
20
]
The fundamental principle of sentencing is
proportionality. “The sentence must be severe enough to denounce the offence
but must not exceed what is just and appropriate, given the moral
blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence.”
[1]
[
21
]
Indeed, Parliament has codified this fundamental
principle in s.718.1
CC
, which holds that, “A sentence must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
the offender.”
[
22
]
In arriving at a just sentence for Mr. Johnson,
the principle of proportionality requires that I give full consideration to
both factors, without elevating one at the expense of the other.
[2]
[
23
]
In this case, the gravity of the offences – possession
of a loaded prohibited firearm while bound by a weapons prohibition order – is
not seriously in dispute.
[
24
]
“Gun-related crime poses grave danger to
Canadians.” Chief Justice McLachlin’s opening salvo in
R. v. Nur
,
2015
SCC 15
, at para
1
, remains especially applicable some ten years later.
[
25
]
Indeed, as the Ontario Court of Appeal stated in
Morris
:
Gun crimes involving the possession of loaded,
concealed firearms in public places pose a real and immediate danger to the
public, especially anyone who interacts with the gun holder. When the person
with the gun is confronted by the police, who are engaged in the lawful
execution of their duties, the risk increases dramatically. It increases yet
again when the gun holder flees, and still again when the gun holder discards
the weapon in a public place. A person who carries a concealed, loaded handgun
in public undermines the community’s sense of safety and security. Carrying a
concealed, loaded handgun in a public place in Canada is antithetical to the
Canadian concept of a free and ordered society:
see
Nur
(ONCA), at paras. 82,
206; R. v. Felawka,
1993 CanLII 36 (SCC)
,
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 199
,
[1993] S.C.J. No. 117
, at pp.214-15
.
[3]
[
26
]
Rather, it is Mr. Johnson’s degree of
responsibility, as understood under the
Morris
framework, that the
defence argues should be considered diminished.
[
27
]
The primary sentencing considerations for possession
of a loaded prohibited firearm are denunciation, general deterrence and
protection of the public.
[4]
[
28
]
Chief Justice Lamer explained the principle of
denunciation in the following terms:
The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence
should also communicate society’s condemnation of that particular offender’s
conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a
symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished
for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our
substantive criminal law… Our criminal law is also a system of values. A
sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values
are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to
undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner
which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all
Canadians as expressed by the
Criminal Code
.
[5]
[
29
]
General deterrence is grounded in the theory
that punishment will discourage others in the community from engaging in that
particular type of crime. It is engaged either when the crime is particularly
heinous or when the crime is particularly prevalent in the community.
[6]
[
30
]
I have no difficulty concluding that possession
of a loaded firearm in public is both serious and prevalent in our community.
[
31
]
The principle of specific deterrence relates to
the need to send a message to the individual being sentenced. Given Mr. Johnson’s
possession of a prohibited handgun in flagrant defiance of a weapons
prohibition order, the appropriate sentence must take into account specific
deterrence.
[
32
]
The principle of parity (s.718.2(b)
C.C.
)
directs that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. This is a
notoriously difficult exercise, as no two cases are exactly the same. As
succinctly stated by Chief Justice Lamer, “…the search for a single appropriate
sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a
fruitless exercise of academic frustration.”
[7]
[
33
]
This point is illustrated by the vast range of
sentences handed down in somewhat similar circumstances (i.e. gun possession
with
Morris
factors engaged) in the last three years alone, from
conditional sentence orders
[8]
to upper reformatory sentences
[9]
to significant periods of incarceration in the penitentiary
[10]
.
[
34
]
The principle of restraint (s.718.2(d) and (e)
C.C.)
recognizes that prison should be the sentence of last resort and that the court
should consider the least intrusive alternatives, provided the other sentencing
principles are appropriately addressed.
[
35
]
The totality principle requires a sentencing
judge who orders a consecutive sentence to ensure that the cumulative sentence
imposed does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender.
[
36
]
Finally, in determining a just sentence, I must
take into account all relevant aggravating factors (including the statutory
aggravating factors in s.718.2(a)
C.C
.) and mitigating factors relating
to the offence and the offender.
AGGRAVATING & MITIGATING
FACTORS
[
37
]
There are significant aggravating factors in
this case, including:
•
Mr. Johnson possessed a loaded prohibited
firearm in a motor vehicle travelling to and from a night club.
•
The firearm was a Smith
& Wesson M & P Bodyguard 380 handgun, more concealable and easily
accessible than a long gun.
•
Firearm-related crime is an epidemic in Canada.
This alarming trend no doubt influenced Parliament’s decision to increase the
maximum sentence for s.95(1) offences from 10 to 14 years in December of 2023.
•
The fact that the handgun was loaded with a
bullet in the chamber suggests a willingness to use it, if necessary.
•
Mr. Johnson discarded the loaded handgun in an
entirely public space that was accessible to any person walking by, including a
child.
•
Pictures on Mr. Johnson’s phone of the exact
same type of firearm are indicative of more than a fleeting interest in the
Smith & Wesson M & P Bodyguard 380 handgun.
•
Mr. Johnson has a criminal record for a serious
offence, a break and enter, for which he received a conditional sentence.
•
At the time of these charges, Mr. Johnson was on
a release for offences in Peel Region.
•
Mr. Johnson was bound by a weapons prohibition
order at the time. While this is no doubt aggravating in the common sense of
the word, I will not treat it as such with respect to the s.95(1)
CC
offence, as it will be the subject of a consecutive sentence on the s.117.01(1)
CC
offence.
•
With respect to the s.117.01(1)
CC
offence,
it is aggravating that Mr. Johnson breached the prohibition order in two ways,
by possessing a firearm
and
ammunition.
[
38
]
I accept the following factors as mitigating on
sentence:
•
Mr. Johnson is young enough, at 30 years old, to
take advantage of his rehabilitative potential.
•
Mr. Johnson has significant support from family
members and members of the community. By all accounts, he is a good son,
brother, partner and father. He is also a valued and involved member of
different community organizations.
•
I consider it mitigating that whatever custodial
sentence I impose will disrupt his ability to raise his daughter and, in turn, will
likely have long-lasting effects on her.
•
There is limited mitigating value in the fact
that he suffered a gunshot wound that night, as the defence reminds me that there
is no evidence that Mr. Johnson’s injury was in any way connected to his
possession of a firearm - although common sense, experience and intuition may
suggest otherwise.
•
As a result of these charges, Mr. Johnson spent nine
actual days in custody.
[
39
]
The defence submits that there are a number of
Morris
factors that significantly reduce Mr. Johnson’s moral blameworthiness. I will
address this below.
[
40
]
While a guilty plea would be a significant
mitigating factor, I wish to emphasize that Mr. Johnson’s decision to advance
numerous
Charter
arguments and take this matter to trial is
not
an
aggravating factor. It simply represents the absence of a significant
mitigating factor.
THE
MORRIS
FACTORS &
MR. JOHNSON’S DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY
[
41
]
In the seminal decision of
R. v. Morris
,
2021 ONCA 680
, the Court of Appeal for Ontario arrived at the following
principal conclusions, at para 13.:
Social context evidence relating to the offender’s
life experiences may be used where relevant to mitigate the offender’s degree
of responsibility for the offence and/or to assist in the blending of the
principles and objectives of sentencing to achieve a sentence which best serves
the purposes of sentencing as described in s.718.
The gravity or seriousness of an offence is determined
by its normative wrongfulness and the harm posed or caused by that conduct in
the circumstances in which the conduct occurred. Accordingly, unlike when
assessing the offender’s degree of personal responsibility, an offender’s
experience with anti-Black racism does not impact on the seriousness or gravity
of the offence.
Courts may acquire relevant social context evidence
through the proper application of judicial notice or as social context evidence
describing the existence, causes and impact of anti-Black racism in Canadian
society, and the specific effect of anti-Black racism on the offender.
Consistent with the rules of admissibility, a generous
gateway for the admission of objective and balanced social context evidence
should be provided.
[
42
]
I have no hesitation taking judicial notice of
the contents of the “Expert Report on Crime, Criminal Justice and the
Experience of Black Canadians in Toronto, Ontario” that formed Appendix A of
the trial-level sentencing decision in
R. v. Morris
,
2018 ONSC 5186
.
[
43
]
While I have ample social context evidence of
anti-Black racism in Ontario, the evidence about Mr. Johnson himself is
difficult to gauge in assessing his degree of moral blameworthiness with
respect to these specific offences.
[
44
]
I accept that Mr. Johnson grew up in a troubled
neighbourhood plagued with gun and gang violence and surrounded by casualties
with whom he was acquainted. I accept that this environment had lasting effects
on Mr. Johnson.
[
45
]
I further accept that the legacy of overt and
systemic anti-black racism in Ontario directly or indirectly contributed to Mr.
Johnson’s educational, economic and social disadvantages.
[
46
]
It is, however, difficult for me to fully assess
the defence submission that Mr. Johnson felt that he needed a firearm for
protection. I understand from defence submissions that Mr. Johnson’s
environment changed dramatically at the age of 17 when his mother’s economic
situation improved and she moved the family to a more affluent neighbourhood in
Brampton. Without further elaboration, I am left without a clear idea why Mr.
Johnson still felt the need to arm himself 11 years after moving out of the
Mount Olive neighbourhood.
[
47
]
It is clear to me that anti-Black racism,
including overt and systemic anti-Black racism, continues to plague all aspects
of our society. The criminal justice system is not exempted.
[
48
]
With this reality in mind, despite the gap in
information before me about the reasons for Mr. Johnson’s possession of a
firearm, I am nonetheless satisfied that anti-Black racism played
some
role in leading Mr. Johnson to make an extremely ill-advised choice on 20
October 2022.
[
49
]
On the record before me, I conclude that Mr. Johnson’s
moral blameworthiness was somewhat diminished, although not significantly so.
THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE
[
50
]
Sentencing is both an individualized process and
a difficult exercise. This case is no exception.
[
51
]
I have before me a 30-year-old male with
unlimited potential who is beloved by his family members and members in the
community. And yet this same male brought a loaded handgun out in the public
while expressly prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition.
[
52
]
Having carefully considered the circumstances of
the offences, the circumstances of the offender, and all aggravating and
mitigating factors, I have concluded that the least restrictive sentence that adequately
achieves the purpose and principles of sentencing is as follows:
Possession of a Loaded Prohibited
Firearm – s.95(1)
CC
:
•
35 months, 15 days in custody (in light of 9
actual days in custody, credited as 15 days pre-sentence custody)
•
DNA Order (secondary designated offence)
•
S.109 Prohibition Order for life
Possession of a Prohibited
Firearm Knowing its Possession is Unauthorized – s.92(1)
CC
•
24 months custody, concurrent
Possession of a Firearm Contrary
to a Prohibition Order – s.117.01(1)
CC
•
Nine months custody, consecutive.
[
53
]
In summary, Mr. Johnson will serve an additional
44 months and 15 days in custody.
[
54
]
Finally, I will sign the disposition of property
order that has been submitted.
