for K. Carmichael
WENDL J.:
[
1
]
Kevin Carmichael pleaded guilty to several offences under the
Securities
Act
including fraud.  Essentially, Mr. Carmichael was operating a Ponzi
scheme.  Mr. Carmichael obtained approximately $32 million from investors, roughly
$9 million was returned to them, around $5.5 million was paid in taxes. Mr.
Carmichael and his company took close to $7 million, Mr. Aonso (the offender’s business
partner) received $4.8 million
[1]
,
$377,000 went towards credit card payments, and $346,000 to Mr. Carmichael’s spouse. 
The investor’s combined loss is somewhere between $18 million and $23 million.
[2]
The impact on Mr. Carmichael’s investors was devastating, some of the details
of which I will set out below. He stole from some a comfortable retirement,
from others the ability to support their family.  He caused discord in
marriages and ruined the hopes and dreams of hard-working people who put their
trust in him.
[

]
The Crown is requesting a jail sentence of 4 years.  Mr. Hutchison, on
behalf of the offender, is seeking that I impose 2 ½ years.
VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS
[
3
]
The impact of Mr. Carmichael’s fraud has been significant.  The
following is but a highlight of some of the passages from the many victim
impact statements I received at the sentencing hearing.
[
4
]
Burl Mathias writes how the savings he had for his daughter’s education
was wiped out.  He believed that his retirement fund had increased to $500,000,
only to find out that he now has nothing.
[
5
]
Desiree Mathias states that the financial loss has caused her incredible
stress and anxiety.  A substantial portion of the investment came from her
parents who were in their 80s at the time they loaned her the money.  Both her
parents now require full-time care, and the loss of money has impacted Ms.
Mathias’ ability to provide for their needs. She concludes her victim impact
statement by noting that the feeling of betrayal was immeasurable.
[
6
]
Catherine Brennan writes that based on the fraudulent investment
statements provided to her, she loaned money to her children.  Her children are
not in an economic position to give her the money back.  Now at 68 years old,
she cannot retire as she intended and will have to continue working as long as
her employer will keep her on.  When she can no longer work, she will have to
survive on CPP and OAS, and hopefully some savings she may gain from future
employment. Her dreams of travelling in retirement are gone and she has to
count every penny.  The stress of the loss has affected her significantly.
[
7
]
Clare Brennan simply writes that the loss of her investment has become a
nightmare.  She is single and has no one to fall back on.  The loss will affect
her standard of living in retirement.
[
8
]
Dale Barretto summarizes the impact succinctly: “The devastation they
have caused is immense.  My wife and I have lost a substantial portion of our hard-earned
savings, money that represented security, stability, the peace of mind we
worked for, has been stolen from us.”
[
9
]
David Kun Wah Yeung, a foreign national who invested heavily in Canada,
points out not only the harm to him that the investment has caused him, but it has
shaken his faith in the integrity of Canadian financial institutions and
Government agencies.  He has stopped investing in Canada and told his friends
not to.
[
10
]
Douglas
Chadder and Jennifer Borcsok, whose father was a friend of Mr. Aonso, write at
the conclusion of their victim impact statement: “In closing, Your Honor, the
impact of the fraud conducted by Michael Aonso and Kevin Carmichael has been
felt in every corner of our lives.  It has not only stolen our father’s legacy,
but it has also stolen our ability to properly grieve and move forward.  It has
caused ongoing financial hardship and an unbearable burden that we continue to
carry every day.”
[
11
]
Ed
Lobo who introduced friends to Mr. Carmichael, who then embezzled the money
they invested, states that he will carry that burden of guilt with him for the
rest of his life.
[
12
]
Jeff
Kerry describes how he had planned to use the money he lost to fund his
retirement and support the education of his daughter, nieces and nephews.  He
feels cheated and embarrassed.
[
13
]
Karen
Ritter writes about how worried she is that when she retires she will not have
enough money to pay for long term or nursing care for herself.
[
14
]
Kurt
McWilliams explains how he and his wife must now continue working instead of
retiring, having lost the benefits of years of hard work and savings.  He goes
on to note that his wife now deals with feelings of financial insecurity. He
also introduced his brother to Mr. Aonso and is grappling with feelings of
guilt as a result.
[
15
]
Patrick
and Karen Burka write how this has not only taken their money but has also
taken their peace of mind. They struggle with financial insecurity and have to
continue working beyond their retirement age. They worry about how they are
going to continue helping their daughter with her ongoing medical expenses and
how their financial struggles could impact her quality of life.
[
16
]
Ralph
Berry talks about how the financial loss has robbed him of the ability to help
his kids buy a home.  He also writes about how this has stripped him of the
ability to retire, which is particularly debilitating as he suffers from kidney
disease.  Instead of being able to focus solely on his health, he struggles to go
to work just to survive. He also describes the personal relationships that have
been affected by the fraud.  He encouraged others to invest, and those
relationships have been fractured as a result. He puts it concisely: “I have
lost trust, closeness, and connection with people who once felt like my
greatest support system”.  He also writes: “This crime was not just about
numbers on a screen or a piece of paper.  It was about my future, my health, my
family, and my faith in a system that was supposed to protect me.”
[
17
]
Reid
MacWilliams had to move away from Ontario due to the high cost of living.  He
had to leave behind family and friends made over a lifetime, friends that he
cannot go see in the final years of their lives. Like many of the other victims,
he notes that at the age of 76 this has ruined his retirement.
[
18
]
These
victim impact statements demonstrate that the loss is not purely financial.  There
is the loss of trust between friends who advised others to invest and the loss
of faith in the Canadian investment system.  The massive fraud has delayed,
limited or destroyed retirement plans for most of those who invested with Mr.
Carmichael and it has hampered their ability to care for loved ones.  Without a
doubt the loss inflicted by Mr. Carmichael has been tremendous.  It is the loss
of hope and the loss of dreams.
Personal Circumstances of the Offender
[
19
]
Mr.
Carmichael is 54 years old. He has no criminal record. He was gainfully
employed his whole life prior to beginning Strike Holdings in 2012.  He is
currently unemployed and resides with his parents who support him. In his
letter to the Court, Mr. Carmichael accepts responsibility and expresses
remorse.
[
20
]
He
has two children.  His daughter is involved in theatre and his son attends
university in Halifax.  His son describes Mr. Carmichael as a devoted father. 
His parents note how he helps them with their activities of daily living, given
their age and physical limitations, and they continue to support him throughout
this process.  It is not lost on this Court that Mr. Carmichael benefits from the
support of his parents, something the victims of this crime now have difficulty
doing for their children now.
[
21
]
I
also received letters of support from Harun-Baha
Celebi
and Carl Krikorian
.  Mr Celibi describes the offender’s professional acumen
and Mr. Krikorian describes the offender as a trusted advisor.  I have serious
reservations about the content of these letters.  Simply put, given the charges
before the Court, I cannot put any weight on comments about Mr. Carmichael’s
professionalism or trustworthiness, even if they relate to other business
activities.  Mr. Carmichael has pled guilty to a crime of dishonesty that resulted
in over 40 people losing years of their savings.  His actions have demonstrated
that he is not a trustworthy advisor and he failed to act in a manner that
could meet any definition of the word professional.
LAW AND ANALYSIS
[
22
]
Justice
Camara thoroughly summarized the applicable principles for sentencing under the
Securities Act
in
Deboer
[3]
:
When
determining the appropriate sentence, it is necessary to consider how the
offence ties to the purpose of the act. The purpose of the
Securities
Act
is set out in
section 1.1
.:
1.1 The purpose of this Act are,
a)To
provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices;
b)To
foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in
capital markets;
b.1)To foster capital formation; and
c)To
contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of
systemic risk
The
further a particular offence undermines the goal of the act, the stronger the
sentence needs to be to achieve a strong deterrence message.
The
Ontario Court of Appeal held in
R
v.
Tiffin
:
Unlike
criminal offences, regulatory offences are not prosecuted because they are
inherently abhorrent, but rather because compliance is necessary to achieve the
legislator's public interest goal:
Ontario (Environment, Conservation
and Parks)
v.
Henry of Pelham
,
2018 ONCA
999
(Ont.C.A.) at para
33
. Consistent with the difference in purposes,
while the sentencing of regulatory offenders remains multi-factorial, the
principle of deterrence is the paramount consideration:
Henry of Pelham
,
at para.
38
1
.
Similarly, Douglas J. stated in in
R
v.
Wall
:
Breaches
of the
Security Act
that are not merely technical, but strike
at the very heart of and the purposes of the
Securities Act
and
the means chosen by the legislature to enforce those purposes, that is, means
that are unfair, improper and fraudulent must be punished appropriately.
There
is a greater emphasis on general deterrence when sentencing an offender for a
violation of the
Securities Act
.
If the purposes of
the
Securities Act
are to be realized the sentences imposed
must send a strong message that violations will be punished severely.
Imprisonment for regulatory offences may sometimes be necessary to achieve this
purpose.
How
a regulatory offence is classified can be a significant factor in sentencing.
The more comparable a public welfare offence is to a criminal offence, the more
favourable become the sentencing factors of denunciation, retribution,
deterrence and moral blameworthiness. Moral blameworthiness can be relevant to
the sentencing of a regulatory offender, given that it is probative of the
degree of responsibility of the offender, notwithstanding the fact that
regulatory offences generally involve less moral blameworthiness.
The
conduct Mr. DeBoer acknowledged and plead guilty to is at the higher end of the
scale of moral blameworthiness. The conduct Mr. DeBoer engaged, committing
fraud under the
Securities Act
is a full mens rea offence and comparable to the
offence of fraud contrary to the
Criminal Code of Canada
. The purpose of the
Securities Act is to protect the public and to protect investors from unfair
and fraudulent practices which was precisely the conduct engaged in by Mr.
DeBoer.
[
23
]
In
Mr. Deboer’s case, Justice Camara imposed a sentence of three years. He
received $7.5 million, the purpose of which was for the extraction of oil.  The
funds were instead directed to another purpose which constituted fraud.  All
interviewed investors lost most of their investments. The resulting financial
devastation was profound. The victims were significantly impacted. Many lost
their entire savings or retirement accounts and had their own reputations
tarnished because they believed in the products that were being represented to
them. Justice Camara found that the aggravating factor was the accused's high
degree of moral blameworthiness. The accused's guilty plea was a significant
mitigating factor. He had no prior criminal record. The accused had a history
with the Securities Commission and at the time of the offence, he was bound by
a temporary cease trade order which he breached by promoting and selling
investments.
[
24
]
In
the unreported decision of
Aikman
, Justice Rondinelli imposed a 4-year
sentence for fraud under the
Securities
Act
.  Justice Rondinelli
found that the fraud was complex, the amount taken was “just north of 3.9
million dollars” and the impact on the victims significant.  He highlighted deterrence
as the main sentencing principle.
[
25
]
In
Heward & Wallace
, another unreported decision, Justice McLeod
imposed a sentence of 4 years on a securities fraud.  The amount defrauded was $6,672,955.
 The fraud was described by Justice McLeod as extremely elaborate and
sophisticated.
[
26
]
In
Singh
,
[4]
after trial, Justice Greene imposed a 3 ½ year sentence.  The fraud was
described as an elaborate one.  The total loss to the victims was approximately
$4.8 million.  The fraud was complex and went on for a lengthy period of time.  Many
of the victims in that case were over 70.
[
27
]
A
majority of the defense’s casebook appear to focus on the significant weight
that I should accord a guilty plea:
Rosenberg
[5]
paras 17-19;
Berquas
[6]
paras
33-39
;
Gamble
[7]
paras
108-111
;
Bandali
[8]
para
28
.
[
28
]
Rosenberg
was a fraud case, prosecuted under the
Criminal Code
, where the accused
defrauded $131 million.  The accused was given a 5-year sentence, but Justice
Watt noted at paragraph 26 of this decision that he was not the same person he
once was.  He was in declining health and neither deterrence nor rehabilitation
were found to be factors in the case.  Justice Watt specifically noted given
the mitigating factors, “[i]t ought not be thought to be some sort of standard
sentence imposed in respect of offences of such magnitude which occur over such
a period of time and involve equivalent and egregious breaches of trust.”
[
29
]
In
Castaneda
, also provided by the defence, the accused pleaded guilty to fraud
over $5000 contrary to
section 380(1)
(a) of the
Criminal Code
, for
trading in securities without being registered to trade in securities contrary
to
section 25(1)
of the
Securities Act
and for trading in securities
while being prohibited from doing so, also under the
Securities Act
.  The
fraud charges and the securities charges were interrelated.  The outstanding
amount in this case was $798,000 and the accused pleaded guilty. Justice Fairgrieve
imposed a 6-month sentence on the
Securities
Act
charges and 2
years less a day on the fraud charges. The fraud involved a breach of trust and
the mitigating factors accepted by the Justice were the accused’s age, the lack
of a record and poor health.
[
30
]
In
considering the range of sentence for fraud under the
Securities Act
I am
mindful of the comments of Justice Greene in
Singh
:
With
this factual back drop, I now turn to the range of sentence normally imposed
for these offences. There is not a large body of case law on the range of
sentence normally imposed for a conviction for fraud of this magnitude under
the OSA. As a result, counsel for the OSC relied heavily on cases where
offenders were sentenced for large scale, sophisticated frauds under the
Criminal Code
. The typical range of sentence for a large scale, sophisticated
fraud that involves many victims is usually in the range of three to five
years. When those frauds are a product of a breach of trust, it is not unusual
to see sentences as high as eight to ten years. If I was to rely solely on the
range of sentences for frauds prosecuted under the Criminal Code, a sentence of
five years would be completely appropriate in this case. As I previously
stated, however, it is my view that this is not the correct approach given the
differences in the maximum sentences permitted under the Criminal Code and the
OSA. Clearly lower sentences are contemplated for frauds prosecuted under the
OSA. A sentence of five years less one day is the maximum penalty under the
act. While Mr. Singh's offence is likely one of the most egregious ones
prosecuted under this act, the maximum penalty does not take into account the
numerous mitigating factors that exist in this case.
[9]
[
31
]
Having
reviewed the case law as it specifically relates to large scale investor fraud
under the
Securities Act
, I find that the current range of sentence is 2
to 4 years.  I will note that the case law in the area was very limited and may
still be still evolving.  The range of sentence could easily expand to include
the maximum of 5 year less a day had there been a trial.
[
32
]
The
primary sentencing principle is general deterrence.  The impact on the victims was
devastating.  This type of crime affects confidence in the Canadian financial
system.  The complex nature of the scheme, including false returns and
elaborate investor meetings are aggravating factors to be balanced against the
only significant mitigating factor in this case – the guilty plea.
[
33
]
On
the issue of parity raised by the defense, I will simply point out that Mr.
Carmichael and Mr. Aonso pled to different offences and Mr. Aonso has yet to be
sentenced.
[
34
]
As
for the character of the accused, I have already mentioned that the letters
from Mr. Celebi and Mr. Krikorian are of little value to the court, and as it
relates to his character generally, I adopt the comments of the Court of Appeal
in
Drabinsky
:
Second,
individuals who perpetrate frauds like these are usually seen in the community
as solid, responsible and law-abiding citizens. Often, they suffer personal and
financial ruin as a result of the exposure of their frauds. Those factors
cannot, however, alone justify any departure from the range. The offender's
prior good character and standing in the community are to some extent the tools
by which they commit and sustain frauds over lengthy time periods. Considerable
personal hardship, if not ruin, is virtually inevitable upon exposure of one's
involvement in these kinds of frauds. It cannot be regarded as the kind of
unusual circumstance meriting departure from the range.
[10]
[
35
]
Given
the high moral blameworthiness of Mr. Carmichael and the aggravating factors
which far outweigh the mitigating ones, I find the 4-year sentence requested by
the Crown must be imposed.  To be clear, but for the guilty plea, to which I am
giving significant weight, the maximum sentence would have been appropriate.
[
36
]
Finally,
I feel compelled to comment on the maximum sentence and the range of sentence
for fraud under the
Securities Act
.  To put it simply, it is too low in
my view.  Had the matter proceeded by way of a
Criminal Code
charge the
range of sentence would have been 8 to 12 years as the Court of Appeal stated
in
Reeve
.  The Court of Appeal in
Reeve
imposed a sentence of 10
years on the facts of that case.
[11]
[
37
]
Courts
of Appeal in other provinces have imposed high sentences for large Ponzi frauds.
For example, in
Johnson
the Alberta Court of Appeal reduced a 13-year
sentence to 10 years for a $2.3 million Ponzi scheme involving multiple
victims.
[
38
]
While
I am conscious of the division of powers between the federal and provincial
governments in terms of their legislative purview, the different purposes of
the
Securities Act
and the
Criminal Code
, and the fact that the
maximum sentence is 5 years less a day so as to not run afoul of section 11(f)
of the
Charter,
wherein an accused is entitled to a jury trial if the
maximum sentence is over 5 years, I simply cannot reconcile the difference in
the range of sentence between the two acts on the charge of fraud since both
are full
mens
rea
offences with the same essential elements.  In
fact, given that the purpose of the
Securities Act
is largely general deterrence
and that the impact on the victims is so devastating – it robs them of their
dreams, hope, the ability to enjoy their golden years, support their loved
ones, and fruits of their years of hard labour, it certainly seems that the range
of sentence should be higher under the
Securities Act
.
[
39
]
Had
this matter been brought by way of
Criminal
Code
information, I could
have imposed a sentence in the 8 to 10-year range.  The provincial government
should increase the maximum penalty for a first offence to at least 14 years or
perhaps even 21 years given that the main purpose of the legislation is general
deterrence.  The provincial prosecutors under the
Securities Act
are
highly specialized and there are significant benefits to having them prosecute
such complex offences.  These prosecutors should be given the tools to
prosecute these offences to their fullest.  If a jury trial is requested, the
legislation can comply with the
Charter
by allowing the Ontario Court of
Justice to do jury trials on securities act charges or they can simply refer
the matter to the Superior Court.  Ultimately, and in keeping in mind the
purpose of the provincial legislation, I struggle with the disparity in the
sentences for ostensibly the same offences.
[
40
]
Despite
my misgivings, I sentence Mr. Carmichael to jail for four (4) years.

APPENDIX A
OSC v Kevin Carmichael
Agreed Statement of Fact – January 8,
2025
AGREED STATEMENT OF FACT
Overview
1.
Strike Holdings Inc. [“Strike”] is an
Ontario corporation and a non-reporting issuer which has a registered office
address in Oakville, Ontario. Michael Aonso [“Aonso”] and Kevin Carmichael
[“Carmichael”] were Strike’s two officers and directors between April 30
th
,
2012 and March 31
st
, 2021 [“the Material Time”].
2.
KM Strike Management Inc. [“KMSM”] is
an Ontario corporation and a non-reporting issuer which has a registered office
address in Oakville, Ontario. During the Material Time, KMSM was a management
firm that provided research, analysis, operations and administration services
as well as directed the activities of Strike. Aonso and Carmichael were KMSM’s
two officers and directors.
3.
During the Material Time, Strike, KMSM,
Aonso and Carmichael were not registered in any capacity under the
Ontario
Securities
Act
[“The Act”]
[1]
In particular, Carmichael was not registered to sell shares as required by
section 25(1) of the Act, nor was he exempt from this requirement.
Background to the
investigation
4.
In the late summer of 2019, TD Bank
Group Wealth Compliance [“TD”] forwarded to the Ontario Securities Commission
[“OSC”] a copy of a letter dated August 2
nd
, 2019 [the “TD Letter”]
which they had previously sent to Aonso and Carmichael. The TD Letter was in
response to several concerns raised by Aonso and Carmichael regarding what they
maintained were inaccurate values and transactions reported in Strike’s TD
Direct Investing [“DI”] accounts (along with other issues including missing
wire transfers).
5.
The TD Letter
described how TD staff investigated the Strike accounts and found no
irregularities or evidence of wrongdoing on the part of TD. It also described
the
investigation conducted by TD of the
purported TD DI bank statements uttered by Aonso and Carmichael to TD staff.
The letter described how TD staff found several irregularities in the purported
TD DI account statements and concluded that the purported TD DI statements had
not been issued by TD.
6.
Upon receipt of the TD Letter, the OSC
began an investigation which included executing a number of search warrants on
banks, an accounting firm, a financial risk and advisory firm, as well as the
residences of Aonso (4259 Garnetwood Chase, Mississauga, Ontario) and
Carmichael (549 Hughson Street North, Hamilton, Ontario). The fruits of the
execution of these search warrants allowed OSC investigators to piece together
the story of Strike and KMSM during the Material Time.
History of Strike
7.
In 2012, Aonso and Carmichael created
Strike and KMSM to invest funds on behalf of members of the public, beginning
with several friends and family members. They believed to have developed an
algorithm that would be able to predict the optimum time to invest and sell
certain securities. The investment was structured in a way that investors became
shareholders of Strike and were issued Share Purchase Agreements. Among the
many purported benefits of Strike that Aonso and Carmichael touted to investors
was the transparency of Strike’s business practices and its enhanced
documentation and system management protocols.
[2]
The investors were enticed to invest based upon the predicted or reported
success of the Strike investment strategy, and some of the investors
contributed significant funds.
8.
Aonso and Carmichael received
investments from Ontario citizens and citizens of other jurisdictions like Hong
Kong. Investors were issued share certificates and receipts for their
investments. They had access to an online portal called StrikeNAV in which they
could monitor their investments. As the following screenshots demonstrate,
StrikeNAV was a user experience akin to an online portal one might find at a
bank:
[3]
;
[4]
9.
As the above screenshot of the
StrikeNAV portal demonstrates, throughout the Material Time investors were paid
out dividends on their investments. Shortly after launching the company,
trading in the Strike accounts began to result in significant losses of
investor funds. Despite that, the trading was portrayed as profitable by
Carmichael and Aonso as they did not acknowledge to investors that Strike’s
investing strategy was not as profitable and successful as they had predicted.
Accordingly, these dividend payments were derived from the investments made into
the fund from other investors. Investors could also redeem their investments,
with profit.
[5]
The evidence shows that redemptions were paid to investors in 2017, 2018, and
2019. Those who did redeem were paid using the funds of other investors into
Strike rather than the trading profits Strike claimed they had earned.
10.
Strike held annual
general meetings [“AGM”] whereby investors could gather to hear from Aonso and
Carmichael along with special guests. At these meetings, presentations prepared
by Aonso were made to investors which reiterated the success of the fund and
touted the redemption management tool of the StrikeNAV portal.
[6]
Investors were
also shown the clear dividend growth that Strike had produced, which the
company represented was due to the purported gains of the fund.  The following
screenshots of the June 20, 2018 Strike AGM Powerpoint presentation
demonstrate the nature of these representations:
[7]
11.
In 2015, Strike retained Trinity
Compliance Partners to consult with Strike as to whether their current business
model and operations complied with the regulatory landscape. Trinity completed
their assessment and produced the Trinity Report. It determined that Strike was
not in compliance with the
Act
and advised them to stop operating.
[8]
Following
receipt of the
Trinity Report, Aonso and
Carmichael exchanged views concerning the report over email and through the
track-changes function of a Word document where they agreed to ignore its
conclusions, disregard the stipulations of the Act, and immediately cease any
“evidentiary marketing”.
[9]
12.
By 2017, Aonso and Carmichael were
forming plans to move Strike from Ontario to an off-shore location in the
Caribbean, such as the British Virgin Islands.
[10]
The plan, referred to internally as
Strike International, was to create a number of entities and trade owner seed
capital to the Caribbean with client investments to follow a few months after
this process.
[11]
Plans for this development continued up until the events of the summer
of 2019. In May of 2019, Carmichael emailed TD advising the bank that major
changes were occurring to the Strike business that would require consistent
multi million-dollar transactions.

13.
In June of 2019, Aonso and Carmichael
approached TD and claimed their DI account contained over $97,000,000 USD
despite TD confirming that the balance of the account was $230,481.11 USD. In
the remainder of the Material Time, Carmichael maintained that fraud and/or
error had occurred in TD’s systems, not with Strike. He maintained that TD had
lost their purported gains. He denied the veracity of TD’s bank statements and
maintained that versions of the TD's statements that Carmichael had altered
were authentic and correct.
Carmichael’s role at
Strike
14.
Carmichael was responsible for the trading that occurred in
Strike’s trading accounts. He was also responsible for the movement of money
between Strike’s banking accounts.
[13]
It is Carmichael who provided Strike’s trading and banking statements to
Strike’s bookkeeper, Ms. Lynn Aonso. He also provided Strike’s bank account
statements to third parties. In many instances, what he provided to these
parties were bank statements that he had faked or altered.
15.
Carmichael had access to Strike’s account information from
TD’s Web Broker system and so was privy to the correct statements issued by TD
on the trading accounts throughout the Material Time. The banking documentation
listed only Aonso and Carmichael on the account.
[14]
No other party had access to
Strike’s TD DI accounts.
16.
Carmichael received trade confirmations to his email
address,
[15]
and was captured in voice recordings making trades, inquiring about trades,
converting between currencies, and transferring monies between Strike accounts
with TD staff over the telephone.
[16]
17.
Carmichael claimed to be conducting
trades using Strike’s methodology and algorithm, but in reality used investor
funds to trade in stocks in a way inconsistent with this methodology. One of
the TD telephone audio interceptions of June 30, 2014 reveals that TD staff
informed Carmichael that the Strike account had pending trades to cover for
Blackberry stock.
[17]
Carmichael
acknowledged this in the affirmative.
18.
However, as Aonso indicated in his
email to Carmichael of December 5, 2019, trades in Blackberry were an anomaly
to the Strike trading methodology and yet they had been found in the authentic
TD DI statements provided by the bank. As a result, Strike considered these
trades to be evidence of fraudulent conduct in their trading account by parties
unknown.
[18]
In reality, Carmichael had made those trades himself.
19.
In addition, Carmichael’s personal tax
returns for 2017 and 2018 revealed that he traded in his personal account
precisely those stocks which Strike found anomalous when they inspected the
authentic TD DI statements, including Conatus Pharmaceuticals, Velocity,
TetraPhase, Sarepta, etc...
[19]
Reporting false returns
20. Aonso and Carmichael reported to their
shareholders that they were making impressive returns ranging from 32.7% to
81.8% per year. This was done through periodic investor reports known as “Strike
Reports” which Carmichael assisted in preparing by providing false information
as to the returns being produced by Strike’s trading. An example of the claims
found in the Strike Reports is the following which shows fiscal year-to-date
results for the period 2012 to 2019:
[20]
21.
The Strike Reports also contained comparisons between the
Strike fund and other major market indices to demonstrate Strike’s purported
runaway success by way of comparison:
[21]
22.
No forensic audit of these results was ever undertaken.
This despite two investors, Dale Barretto and David Yeung, signalling to Aonso
and Carmichael that an audit of these results was warranted, or that they could
not reconcile the trading with the documentation provided.
[22]
Altered banking and
trading statements
23.
Throughout the Material Time,
Carmichael, or through his co-accused Aonso, uttered altered banking and
trading statements. These were statements that had been manually altered by Carmichael
to make them appear to contain totals and transactions that were not true.
These statements were uttered on multiple occasions to multiple parties both
internally to Strike and externally to third parties.
24.
Between April 10
th
,
2015 and June 8
th
, 2015, Carmichael uttered two different versions
of Strike’s USD chequing account statement for the month of August 2014 to Lynn
Aonso, the bookkeeper of the firm. During this interaction, Ms. Aonso noticed
that certain inter-account transfers between Strike’s USD and CAD chequing
accounts that she had seen from the CAD account were not featured on the first
version of the USD account statement that she had been provided by Carmichael.
Carmichael then provided a second version of the USD
account statement with the missing transfers now appearing.
[23]
Between October 10
th
and
October 17
th
, 2014, Carmichael uttered altered Strike’s USD banking
statements again to Ms. Aonso that removed personal transfers from Strike’s
bank account to his personal account for the fiscal year ended April 2014.
[24]
25.
Mr. Aonso received all of the Strike TD CAD and USD
chequing account statements that were altered by Carmichael from Carmichael.
Mr. Aonso uttered them directly to investor Patrick Burka in emails in 2020.
[25]
Staff analysis reveals that these
statements included many errors and alterations, including but not limited to:
Over $29,000 CAD in net transfers to Mr.
Carmichael’s personal account was understated or omitted in the CAD account
statements for the year ended April 30, 2013; and
Over $90,000 USD in net transfers to Mr.
Carmichael’s personal account was understated or omitted in the USD account
statements for the period from May 2012 to November 2014.
26.
Carmichael emailed inconsistent trading
account statements for the month ended April 2013 to separate parties. The
first version was to Ms. Aonso, the other was to a representative of the
accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
[26]
27.
Carmichael
emailed inconsistent information relating to Strike’s trading accounts, namely
a bank statement and an Excel spreadsheet purporting to record transactions in
the same account. This related to the opening statement for May 2012 in the US
DI account. Again, the inconsistency was only revealed by comparing the two
documents sent to two separate parties. The first version was the TD bank
account statement. This was sent to Ms. Aonso on September 25
th
,
2015.
[27]
The second version was an Excel
spreadsheet produced by Mr. Carmichael which purported to calculate capital
gains for fiscal year 2012/2013 in the US DI account. This was sent to a
representative of Price Waterhouse Coopers.
[28]
28.
Carmichael and Aonso also uttered the
altered trading account statements he made to a representative of the financial
risk and advisory firm Duff & Phelps on July 8
th
, 2019, as well
as July 11
th
, 2019.
[29]
29.
Having received the altered trading
account statements from Carmichael, Aonso also uttered them to investors
through email exchanges. This included directly to investor Patrick Burka,
[30]
as well as in a mass email to
investors interested in investing in the subsequent debenture raise.
[31]
As noted above, when Aonso and
Carmichael approached their branch of the TD Bank in June of 2019 and claimed
to have $97 million USD on deposit, their representations to the bank included
uttering to TD the TD DI statements Carmichael had altered.
The subsequent
debenture raise
30.
TD Bank staff did an internal audit and
confirmed that there were no missing funds and that their records were
accurate. Nonetheless, in the latter part of 2020, Aonso approached some of
their existing shareholders to raise funds in order to proceed in a civil
action against TD Bank to recover their purportedly lost funds. Carmichael
participated in the meetings in which this further investment was developed,
including the drafting and sending of correspondence to investors soliciting
additional funds, though he did not approach investors to raise funds himself.
Carmichael was also aware that investors were told that Carmichael would be
trading on the raised funds to increase the profits for the lawsuit and
submitted documentation and took other actions consistent with this role.
Carmichael did not at any time inform anyone about the prior forged statements
or that the basis of the potential lawsuit against TD was fraudulent.
31.
Between January and February 2021,
Aonso and Carmichael raised over $934,000 from 20 investors through a debenture
offering. In April of 2021, the OSC won an order to freeze the remaining funds
from this distribution. As a result, over $730,000 of the funds were frozen.
Carmichael and Aonso convinced the debenture investors that it was TD who had
absconded with the money in their account, when in reality it was lost through Strike’s
trading activities and otherwise paid out to various entities, including Aonso
and Carmichael. Carmichael thus raised these debenture funds from investors for
the purpose of litigation against TD, despite knowing that their claim of
wrongdoing against TD was false as he had altered the statements at issue
himself.
Forensic accounting
32.
The OSC’s forensic accounting of
Strike’s accounts during the Material Time discovered that Strike did not
produce profits of 30% to 80% as investors were promised, but rather generated
no profits and lost marginal amounts from its trading activities, contrary to
the Strike Reports sent to their shareholders and the altered trading
statements they uttered to third parties.
33.
In its analysis, OSC staff identified
24 relevant bank and trading accounts. The forensic accounting analysis
determined that, between 2012 and 2019, Strike’s TD accounts received over $31
million CAD,
[32]
and in 2021, Strike raised an additional $934,000 CAD from 20 investors in its
debenture offering. The total amount of money raised from investors during the
Material Time was over $32 million CAD.
34.
A forensic accounting examination
revealed that over $27 million of investors’ funds were disbursed directly or
indirectly through corporations controlled by Aonso and Carmichael as follows:
•
$8,984,383.62 of
investor money was returned as profits or dividends;
[33]
•
$5,688,401.95 in tax payments;
•
$6,858,616.33 to Carmichael and his company (2602623
Ontario Inc);
•
$4,782,524.72 to Aonso and his company (Servnet Enterprise
Group Inc);
•
$377,714.88 for credit card payments;
•
$346,222.91 to Aria Tesolin
(Carmichael’s then-spouse)
