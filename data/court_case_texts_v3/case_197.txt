SENTENCING
JUDGMENT
RUSSELL
SILVERSTEIN, J.:
A.
INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
On April 4, 2025, Mr. Stratigakos (the
offender) was found guilty of having sexually assaulted H.K. on January 1,
2023.
B.
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES
[
2
]
The full details of the crime are set out in
my Reasons for Judgment,
R. v. Stratigakos
,
2025 ONCJ 177
.
[
3
]
In brief, the victim, H.K., knew the
offender through one of his friends. She and a girlfriend were visiting the
offender on New Years Eve. H.K. got quite drunk and she lay down. Her
girlfriend left the basement apartment early the next morning. The offender
then had vaginal sexual intercourse with the intoxicated H.K. without her
consent.
C.
THE
IMPACT OF THE OFFENCES ON THE VICTIM
[
4
]
H.K. read a Victim Impact Statement at the
sentencing hearing. As might be expected, she has been emotionally devastated
by this offence. She turned to drugs and alcohol after the crime. Her school
performance suffered, she lost a job, and she cannot sleep. She has had
thoughts of suicide. She can no longer trust men and her relationship with her
boyfriend has suffered.
D.
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER
[
5
]
Mr. Stratigakos has no prior criminal
record. He was born on […], 1999. He is now 25 years old. He has been accepted
to George Brown College in culinary arts for the fall of 2025.
[
6
]
The offender is described as a hard-working,
honest, and dependable employee. His parents describe him as kind, generous and
loving. He enjoys their continuing support. Many other members of the community
have attested to his strong character and emotional intelligence. He has a
steady girlfriend who remains supportive. His high school educators attest to
his efforts in overcoming certain learning challenges on his way to graduation.
[
7
]
I am convinced that the crime he committed
against H.K. is quite out of character for him.
[
8
]
Here is a portion of what he has related to
his therapist, whose report is referred to below.:
Mr.
Stratigakos is the youngest of three children born to Mr. Frank Stratigakos and
Ms. Christina Stratigakos. His parents are married for 28 years and share two
other daughters older than him. He has a very positive relationship with both
of his parents, and his two sisters.
He
considers his Greek Orthodox faith very important to him and his family and
they attend church on a regular basis.
Mr.
Stratigakos considers his father as his one of his greatest role models. He
shared that his father has worked tirelessly throughout his life, making
countless sacrifices for his family. Every paycheck went toward ensuring they
had a roof over their heads, food on the table, and access to activities like
soccer, basketball, and dance. He expressed that his dad is more than a father
to him and his siblings. He considers him as a friend, mentor, and supporter.
He
strives to embody his father’s kindness, strength, and unwavering dedication in
his own life and hope to one day pass those qualities on to his future
children.
Mr.
Stratigakos shares that his mother has also played a monumental role in shaping
who he is. He shared that she is a rock-solid support of his life and considers
her as someone who has always been there through thick and thin.
Mr.
Stratigakos has shared that he comes from a close-knit family, and the bond he
shares with his siblings is something he treasures.
Mr.
Stratigakos shared that his extended family members also play an important role
in his life. Growing up, Mr. Stratigakos was always an athletic and energetic
child. He remembers that from a very young age even as early as kindergarten,
his parents enrolled him in soccer, which quickly became one of his greatest
passions. He thrived in the sport throughout middle school and played at a
competitive league for many years. However, his journey in soccer took a
difficult turn when he suffered a serious knee injury that required surgery.
That period was one of the most challenging times in his life. The uncertainty
of not knowing if he would ever be able to play again was emotionally and
physically draining. But with time, perseverance, and support, he recovered and
returned to the game he loved.
During
his early years, Mr. Stratigakos was far more focused on sports than academics.
His attention was mainly on the field, and education wasn’t something he truly
appreciated until later. However, that changed after earning his high school diploma,
one of the accomplishments he is most proud of, which allowed him to grow,
mature, and better himself. In working towards receiving his high school
diploma, there were moments of self-doubt and failure, but he refused to give
up. He retook courses he struggled with, worked with tutors, and invested time
and effort in his own learning. He began to enjoy the process of learning, and
he is now inspired to continue growing, both personally and professionally.
E.
THE
POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
[
9
]
Ms. Johri seeks a conditional sentence of two
years less a day followed by three years of probation.
[
10
]
Mr. Spence argues for a penitentiary sentence
of three years.
F.
THE
PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING
[
11
]
The principles
of sentencing are set out in Part XXIII of the
Criminal Code
.
[
12
]
According to
s.
718
of the
Criminal Code
, the "fundamental purpose" of
sentencing is to contribute to "respect for the law and the maintenance of
a just, peaceful and safe society" by imposing "just sanctions"
that have one or more of the following objectives, namely: (a) to denounce
unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the offender and others from committing
offences; (c) to separate offenders from society where necessary; (d) to assist
in rehabilitating offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to
victims or the community; and (f) to promote a sense of responsibility in
offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.
[
13
]
Further,
according to s. 718.1 of the Code, the "fundamental principle" of
sentencing is that a sentence "must be proportionate to the gravity of the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender."
[
14
]
Section 718.2 of
the Code also dictates that, in imposing sentence, the court must also apply a
number of principles including the following:
•
A sentence
should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or
mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender;
•
A
sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for
similar offences committed in similar circumstances;
•
Where
consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly
long or harsh;
•
An
offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may
be appropriate in the circumstances; and,
•
All
available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the
circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention
to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.
[
15
]
The overriding fundamental principle of
sentencing is proportionality. The sentence must be proportional to the gravity
of the offence and the offender's degree of responsibility. Proportionality
"ensures a sentence reflects the gravity of the offence and is closely
tied to the objective of denunciation, promoting justice for victims and
ensuring public confidence in the justice system" while also ensuring
"that a sentence does not exceed what is appropriate, given the moral
blameworthiness of the offender, serving a limiting or restraining function,
ensuring justice for the offender. In our criminal justice system, a just
sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on proportionality and does not
elevate one at the expense of the other"
R. v. Ipeelee
,
2012 SCC 13
at
para
37
.
[
16
]
There can be little doubt that the
sentencing principles of paramount consideration in cases of this kind are
deterrence, general and specific, and denunciation.
G.
THE
AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES
[
17
]
Referring to s. 718.2, there are two
statutory aggravating factors in this case.
•
The victim was under the age of eighteen years.
•
The offence has had and continues to have a
significant impact on the victim.
[
18
]
It is further aggravating that the offender
did not wear a condom and that H.K. was intoxicated and woozy from alcohol
supplied to her by the offender when the offender raped her.
R. v. E.C.
,
2019 ONCA 688
at para
6
.
H.
THE
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES
[
19
]
Mr. Stratigakos is a youthful first offender
of otherwise strong character. He has a remarkable history of community
service. His route to rehabilitation will be supported and facilitated by his
friends and family. He has sought and completed counseling subsequent to his
conviction with Mr. Viral Vyas, a registered social worker and psychotherapist.
[
20
]
The offender has participated with Mr. Vyas
in 15 individual counselling sessions focussing on respecting boundaries and
alcohol/drug abuse. Mr. Vyas reports that the offender has made great progress
in his therapy, which has included guidance in understanding the notion of
consent in sexual relationships.
[
21
]
My review of Mr. Vyas’s report leaves me
convinced that Mr. Stratigakos is at low risk of reoffending.
I.
THE
RELEVANT PRECEDENTS
[
22
]
It is a well settled principle of criminal
law that similar sentences should be imposed on similar offenders for similar
offences in similar circumstances.
Criminal Code
, s. 718.2 (b);
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
at para
2
.
[
23
]
The court must start with the principle recently
set out by our Court of Appeal in
R. v. A.J.K.
,
2022
ONCA 487
at para
77
that
penetration offences, absent some highly mitigating factor, will
typically attract a sentence of 3-5 years in the penitentiary. Our Court of
Appeal, acknowledging that there will sometimes be cases that fall below this
range, where a conditional sentence is being sought by the offender, went on to
hold in
R. v. R.S.
,
2023 ONCA 608
at para
27
that while it may
be that, in some circumstances, a conditional sentence is appropriate for
sexual assault at the lowest end of the range of wrongful conduct, there is no
basis to suppose that it is appropriate for sexual assault at the higher end of
that range.
[
24
]
Defence counsel supplied several precedents
in support of her position that a conditional sentence is appropriate in the
case at bar
.

;

No. 2115
;

.,
[2024] B.C.J. No. 743
;
R. v. K.B.
,
[2023]
O.J. No. 1611
; R. v. Huntley
,
[2024] A.J. No. 1429
;
R. v. Dickson
,
[2023] O.J. No. 2115
;

.,
[2024] N.S.J. No. 37
;

,

;
R. v. Browne
,
[2021] O.J. No 5258
and
R. v.
Holland
,
2022 ONSC 1540 (CanLII)
,
[2022] O.J. No. 1611
[
25
]
These cases are all quite distinguishable
from the case at bar. They either involve less serious criminal activity,
demonstrations of remorse through guilty pleas or otherwise, or involve the
application of
Gladue
principles.
J.
CONCLUSION
[
26
]
Even though a conditional sentence is
statutorily available, and even though I do not believe that Mr. Stratigakos
poses a future risk to the safety of the community, I do not believe that a
conditional sentence can properly address the principles of sentencing.
[
27
]
Considering the aggravating and mitigating factors
set out above, the relevant precedents as well as the characteristics of the
offence and the offender, I sentence Mr. Stratigakos to a term of incarceration
for two years.
[
28
]
The parties agree that the following
ancillary orders should be made:
•
A primary DNA order;
•
A s.109 order for 10
years;
•
A SOIRA order for life.
