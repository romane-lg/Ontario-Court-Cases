JUDGMENT on
DIRECTED VERDICT APPLICATION
RUSSELL
SILVERSTEIN, J.:
A.
INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
Mr. Vernaza-Vinces is charged with flight
from a police officer contrary to
s. 320.17
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
2
]
Mr. Leitold, counsel for Mr. Vernaza-Vinces
has brought a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal at the end of the
Crown’s case.
B.
THE
EVIDENCE
(a)
Introduction
[
3
]
What follows is a summary of the salient
aspects of the Crown’s case. A transcript of the proceedings is available.
[
4
]
On February 16, 2024, P.C. Adam Hough and
his partner, Steve Mitakidis responded to a radio call regarding “unknown
trouble” at an address on Osler Street in the City of Toronto. The radio call
suggested that someone had reported a woman screaming in distress while a man
was trying to pull her back into a car.
[
5
]
They arrived on scene with their emergency
lights and siren engaged. They parked their cruiser just north of an empty
black Honda that was still running with its lights on.
[
6
]
They both got out of their cruiser and
approached the Honda.
[
7
]
A man, alleged to be Mr. Vernaza-Vinces,
approached the officers on foot. He matched the description of the man referred
to in the radio call.
[
8
]
The officers engaged him in conversation and
soon noticed blood on his hand and told him he was under investigative
detention. The man initially said he would comply but soon ran off. The
officers pursued him on foot. They yelled at him to stop and told him he was
under arrest. The man then got into the Honda and sped away. The officers did
not pursue him in their police cruiser but rather tried to locate the female
victim of the dispute they were investigating.
C.
ISSUES
AND ANALYSIS
(a)
Introduction
[
9
]
Section 320.17 reads as follows:
Everyone commits an offence who
operates a motor vehicle or vessel while being pursued by a peace officer and
who fails, without reasonable excuse, to stop the motor vehicle or vessel as
soon as is reasonable in the circumstances.
[
10
]
This section came into force in 2018, having
replaced its predecessor, section 249.1(1), which read as follows:
Everyone commits an
offence who, operating a motor vehicle while being pursued by a peace officer
operating a motor vehicle, fails, without reasonable excuse and in order to
evade the peace officer, to stop the vehicle as soon as is reasonable in the
circumstances.
[
11
]
Under the old section 249.1(1) it was
expressly stated in the section that it was essential
that
the Crown prove that the accused was being pursued by police who were
themselves operating a motor vehicle
. This is clear from a plain reading of
the section.
R. v. McLean
,
2016 ONCA 38
at para.
6
, referring to
R.
v. Kulchisky
,
2007 ABCA 110
at para.
4
.
[
12
]
In his directed verdict application Mr.
Leitold
argues that even though the new section, 320.17,
no longer contains that requirement, it remains essential that the Crown prove
that the police were operating a motor vehicle while in pursuit.
He principally
relies on two trial decisions in the Superior Court of Ontario in support of
his argument:
R. v. Hadi
,
2022 ONSC 2903
at para.
123
, a decision of
Schreck J.  and
R. v. Campbell
,
2023 ONSC 5284
, at para.
31
, a decision
of Boswell J. See too
R. v. Russell
,
2023 BCSC 1123
at para.
160
.
[
13
]
In
Hadi
,
Schreck J., when setting out
the essential elements of
s. 320.17
refers to
Kulchisky
and notes that
while the earlier flight provision, s. 249.1 required proof of an intention to
evade police, such was no longer the case for
s. 320.17
. He seems to have
failed to notice that the requirement that police be pursuing in a motor
vehicle was also taken out of the provision. Had he noticed, I am certain that
he would have removed that required element from his list of essential elements.
It is also important to note that this requirement was not in issue in
Hadi
.
Schreck J.’s inclusion of this essential element is thus
obiter
.
[
14
]
In
Campbell
,
Boswell J. refers to
Kulchisky
and lists the required elements of the old section without appreciating that
the requirement that the police be in pursuit while operating a motor vehicle
had been dropped from the provision. Again, that element of proof was not in issue
in
Campbell
and Boswell J’s list is thus
obiter
in that regard.
[
15
]
The statements in
Hadi
and
Campbell
regarding this “essential element” are
obiter dicta
in trial decisions
of the Superior Court of Ontario. The modern rules of
stare decisis
dictate that they are not binding on me.
R. v. Kirkpatrick
,
2022 SCC 33
.
[
16
]
I would normally find rulings on the law
from Justices Schreck and Boswell to be very persuasive, but as I have tried to
demonstrate, I believe these statements of law concerning this particular
“essential element” are incorrect.
[
17
]
As the Supreme Court recently said in
R.
v. Breault
2023 SCC 9
at para.
25
:
Every statutory interpretation
exercise involves reading the words of a provision “in their entire context and
in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (
Rizzo &
Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)
,
1998 CanLII 837 (SCC)
,
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27
, at para.
21
, quoting E. A.
Driedger,
Construction of Statutes
(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87;
Bell
ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex
,
2002 SCC 42
,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 559
, at
para.
26
; see also
R. v. J.D.
,
2022 SCC 15
, at para.
21
)
[
18
]
Parliament expressly removed the required
element in issue in this case from the provision. There is no support for the
notion that Parliament intended to maintain an essential element of the offence
that was expressly set out in the old section and removed in the new one.
[
19
]
I conclude that s. 320.17 does not require
the Crown to prove that the police were operating a motor vehicle, or in a
motor vehicle when pursuing the accused.
[
20
]
It is thus unnecessary to consider the
Crown’s interesting argument that the police were indeed operating their police
cruiser when they pursued Mr. Veneza-Vinces on foot.
[
21
]
There is ample evidence of all the required
elements in this case.
D.
CONCLUSION
[
22
]
The application for a directed verdict is
dismissed.
Released on May
