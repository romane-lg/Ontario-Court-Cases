HAWKE J.:
A. INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
The Defendant, Jessica Montana is charged as
follows:
1)
That “on or
about the 20th day of February in the year 2024, …..did operate a conveyance
while their ability to operate it was impaired to any degree by
alcohol, or a drug, or both, contrary to
section
320.14(1)
(a) of the
Criminal Code
.”
2)
That “on or
about the 20th day of February in the year 2024, …..did, knowing that a demand
had been made, fail or refuse to comply with a demand made by a peace officer
under
section 320
.27 or
320.28
of the
Criminal Code
,
contrary to
section 320.15(1)
of the Criminal Code.”
[
2
]
There was a trial in this case. The Arresting Officer, the Evaluating Officer
and the Defendant testified. A second defence witness was not called as the
Crown conceded relevant parts of his anticipated evidence.
[
3
]
At the end of the trial the Crown conceded that it had not proven Count
# 1 – Operation While Impaired.
[
4
]
This left the issue of whether the Crown had proven all of the elements
of Count #2 – Failure or Refusal to Comply with Demand.
[
5
]
In this case I found that the Crown did not prove the elements of the
charge under 320.15(1). I provide my reasons for this decision below.
B. THE EVIDENCE
i) The Arresting Officer and
excerpts from cruiser cameras
[
6
]
The arresting officer was Police Constable Monica Szok (Arresting
Officer). At 12:41 a.m. she pulled her cruiser in behind the Defendant’s
vehicle and another cruiser pulled in front of it.
[
7
]
The Defendant’s vehicle was stopped, in the inner lane of two
south bound lanes of James Street
South, in the City
of Hamilton,
just prior to an intersection controlled by traffic lights.
The intersection was for Herkimer Street (i.e. to the right/west) and the
entrance to the St.
Joseph’s Hospital Emergency Department
(i.e. to left/east) on James
Street South.
[
8
]
In a video clip (Exhibit 2) the following can be seen and heard:
•
The Arresting Officer looks into the driver’s side window
(12:43:10); she tells another officer it looks like the driver is sleeping; and
she moves her cruiser closer to the Defendant’s:
•
Then over the course of the next two minutes (12:44:12 -
12:46:14) the following takes place. The Arresting Officer: opens the driver’s
door of the Defendant’s vehicle; says ‘Can you put the vehicle in park for
me?’; instructs the Defendant to remove her seat belt and then repeats the
instruction; asks the Defendant to step out and she does; closes the door and
asks the Defendant her name and gets a response; and asks ‘where are you
going?’. The Defendant’s response is inaudible but the video shows her pointing
at the
Emergency Department of St. Joseph’s
Hospital, where there is an ambulance in the bay that runs parallel to the
street. The Defendant is placed in handcuffs and other officers search the
vehicle.
[
9
]
For this same period of time the Arresting Officer testified that:  the
Defendant appeared to be asleep and slouched
forward;
it took a few attempts to rouse her (not apparent on video); she was
slow to follow instructions; when she got out she was unsteady on her feet;
there was no smell of alcohol; and the Defendant dropped a meth pipe.
[
10
]
The
Arresting Officer testified that when placing the cuffs on the Defendant she
said she was being arrested for impaired operation of a motor vehicle and
shortly thereafter she did the Rights to Counsel, caution and DRE demand. I
understood the officer to be saying this was all in the same location, on the
street, outside the hospital and then she transported the Defendant to Station
30.
[
11
]
There
is another video clip in evidence. It is at the scene and shows approximately
one minute of time (12:47:50
- 12:48:44)
when the officer is doing a search prior to putting the Defendant into the
cruiser. The clip begins with the Defendant saying ‘like a week and a bit ago’
‘on my stomach, gall blander so
it’s
very sore’. The Arresting Officer is trying to
figure out the location and the Defendant says ‘It’s like up on the top, like
they did 5 incisions, I’ve got 2 on one side and 1 on the other and’. The
officer says she will be very careful and she asks about various possible
objects on the defendant. The Defendant says ‘No’.  The search begins and the
officer asks the Defendant how many pairs of pants she is wearing and the clip
ends there. The Defendant appears
to be
wearing
a winter coat.
[
12
]
Regarding
the demand, when first asked about it the Arresting Officer testified that the
Defendant ‘agreed’ to the demand. When she was asked to do it specifically she
said the Defendant ‘understood’ the demand.
[
13
]
According to the Arresting
Officer’s testimony the
words of the demand were
:  “I
demand that you
submit to an evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer to determine whether
your ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a drug or a combination of
a drug and
alcohol and that you accompany me now for
this purpose. Do you understand?” A. “Yes.”
[
14
]
The
following is a timeline of subsequent events based on the Arresting Officer’s
evidence:
•
12:48:44 a.m. - Video clip mentioned above of search prior to
entry into cruiser
•
Unknown - Leave scene for 7-8 km drive to Station 30
•
1:
14 a.m. -
Arrive at Station
30. In cruiser the Right to Counsel was done again and the Defendant gave a
lawyer’s name at 1:15
.
The Defendant was left in the cruiser with Arresting Officer’s partner
and the Arresting Officer entered the station for the purpose of giving her
grounds to Police Constable McClure (Evaluating Officer)
.
The Arresting
Officer testified that this is standard procedure for any arrest and also that
the evaluating officer would determine if he was going to continue with the
evaluation
•
1:25 a.m. - Arresting Officer provided grounds to Evaluating Officer
•
1:40 a.m. - Defendant was brought into the station (26 minutes
after arriving) searched and placed in a cell
•
1:
44 a.m. -
1:48 a.m.
- Calls were made to the named lawyer and
associate and voice mails left (i.e. 29 min after request). The Arresting Officer
let the Defendant know and the Defendant did not want anyone else to be called.
•
2:18 a.m. - The Defendant  entered the evaluation room
COMMENTS
[
15
]
The
Defendant sat in a cruiser for nearly a half hour outside the station while the
Arresting Officer made no attempt to call the lawyer named by the Defendant and
while she did things that were apparently expected of her by the Hamilton
Police Service.  This included giving her grounds to the Evaluating Officer
in
order to learn if he would continue with the evaluation, which is an unusual procedure
and it is not part of the framework in the
Criminal Code
.
[
16
]
The
trial was focused on other issues but I am highlighting this evidence because
it is consistent with what happens later with the Defendant and the Evaluating Officer
where priority was given to local police practices/directives.
ii) The Evaluating Officer and
evaluation room video
[
17
]
Police Constable Christopher McClure (Evaluating Officer) was the
evaluating officer
. His certification by the International Association
of Chief’s of Police as a Drug Recognition Expert was filed as an Exhibit.
[
18
]
The
Defendant entered the room where the Evaluating Officer
was at 2:18
a.m.  Below I have transcribed the video of their entire interaction.
Unfortunately, I had problems with the time of day on this video so I did the
transcription in minutes and seconds of running time. The Defendant entered the
room at 1 minute and 37 seconds using the running time, so using the officer’s
evidence this would equate to 2:18 a.m.
0:00
i.e. 0 minutes
&
0
  seconds
Video begins and Evaluating Officer is in the room.
(Note: In this transcript ‘officer’ means the
  Evaluating Officer unless otherwise noted.)
1:25
Officer:
Seated
  at desk in corner, spins chair quickly to door and back and says “come on in
  here”
1:33
Arresting Officer:
Defendant is at the door and Arresting Officer says:
  “Have a seat in the silver chair.”
1:35
Officer:
Defendant  enters room. Evaluating Officer
says
  to  Arresting Officer “Do you want to just grab her hoodie from her”. The Defendant
  removes her hoodie without difficulty. (the front zipper was unzipped from
  the beginning)
2:05
Officer:
“Just have a seat in that chair for me ma’am.” As the 
  Defendant sits down she is  holding her arms crossed in front of her, with
  her elbows bent upward and her arms crossed near her wrists. This results in
  each arm covering the corresponding breast. She appears to be cowering given
  what I just described plus her upper body is bent inward and somewhat
  downward. She is wearing a camisole with spaghetti straps, leggings and
  socks.
2:12
Officer:
“Ok I got to go over a few things with you before we
  get started. The first thing is that you will be audio and video recorded
  while we are in here, at all times. Do you understand that?”
2:18
Defendant:
Officer:
Defendant:
“Yes.” (barely audible)
“Yes or no”
”Yes.” (barely audible/discernible, nodding
  yes)
2:22
Officer
“I am going to go over a few things with you, if at
  any point you don’t understand ask me to repeat it - my name is Chris - and I
  will do my best to explain it in a different manner.”
2:35
Officer:
“Let’s go over why you are here. You have been
  arrested for impaired operation of a conveyance do you understand that?”
2:40
Officer:
“Do you understand that yes or no?”
2:42
Defendant:
There is a very small sound from her that overlaps
  with the ‘yes or no’ words above.
2:47
Officer:
“Ok I just need nice clear answers for me.”
2:55
Officer:
“Do you understand you have a right to talk to any
  lawyer you wish and you also have a right to talk to duty counsel for free
  legal advice.”
3:01
Defendant:
“Yes.” The Defendant pulls her knees up toward her body
   while attempting to get feet on the chair in front of the crossed arms. She
  is unable to do this. She puts her feet down, crosses her legs keeping her
  knees somewhat elevated.
3:05
Officer:
“My understanding is you asked to talk to Jamie
  Stevenson is that correct? OK, and we left a message for her and if she calls
  back or her associate and we will stop what we are doing and put you on the
  phone with her or the associate. Do you understand?”
3:23
Defendant:
“Ok” or “yes” (very soft)
3:24
Officer:
“Is there anyone else you wanted to talk to?”
3:26
Defendant:
“No.”
3:27
Officer:
“No Duty Counsel, no other lawyers of choice?”
3:29
Defendant:
“No.”
3:30
Officer:
“Ok.”
3:32
Officer:
“I am going to read you a caution right now. You are
  being charged with the operation of a conveyance right now. You are not
  obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say may be
  given as evidence. Do you understand that?”
3:38
Defendant:
(a small sound but basically inaudible)
3:46
Officer:
“I need nice clear answers - I am going to read you a
  secondary caution now. If you have spoken to any other police officer or if
  any other person in authority has spoken to you in connection with this
  matter I want it clearly understood that I do not want it to influence you in
  making a statement - do you understand?”
4:02
Defendant:
(verbal sound cannot discern any word)
4:06
Officer:
Do you understand that the officer has demanded that a
  drug recognition evaluation be conducted?
4:14
Defendant:
“A
h yeh.” (very
faint)
4:20
Officer:
“Will you submit to the drug recognition evaluation?”
4:24
Defendant:
“I don’t even know what that means.”
4:28
Officer:
“That’s ok I will explain it to you. That is a great
  question. So, I’m just going to make notes that I’m explaining this. Ok. So,
  the drug recognition evaluation is a 12 step process, a number of tests that
  I put you through, divided attentions tests as well as clinical tests and at
  the end of it I form an opinion and if I believe the opinion is that you are
  impaired by drugs, one of the seven drug classes then I make a urine demand
  on you. The urine then gets sent away to the Centre of Forensic Science and
  tested for the presence of drugs in the form of a toxicology report. So, the
  officer believes that you are impaired, were operating a conveyance or a
  motor vehicle or a car, impaired by drugs. She made a demand, which she is
  allowed to do by law, for you to come and be put before a drug recognition
  expert, which is myself, for a drug recognition evaluation.  So she has made
  that demand, so what I am asking you is will you submit to the drug
  evaluation, and it is a yes or no, and because we live in Canada you have a
  choice to participate, or not participate, but you just need to be aware that
  if you choose not to participate there is an additional charge of fail to
  comply with demand. Does that explain ever-y-thing from start to finish?”
  (Very small pause) “Do you have any questions before I ask you a question
  again?”
6:13
Defendant:
(no sound or other response)
6:15
Officer:
“Do you have any questions before I ask you the question
  again?”
6:17
Defendant:
(no response)
6:20
Officer:
“I
  am just going to make a couple of notes that I explained this to you.”
6:36
Officer:
“So I am going to ask you again. Will you submit to
  the drug recognition evaluation?”
6:43
Defendant:
“No”
6:49
Officer:
“No, OK, I am going to read you the demand one more
  time (See note) just to give you a second to think about it but I am not
  going to force you into doing anything - So I demand that you submit to an
  evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer to determine whether your
  ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a drug or a combination of a
  drug and alcohol and that you accompany me for this purpose. Do you
  understand that demand?” (Note:  The only other demand with these words was on
  scene approx. 1.5 hours before this)
7:12
Officer:
“Yes or no?”
7:12
Defendant:
(I can only hear a very light sound that overlaps with
  the ‘yes or no’ question of the officer)
7:16
Officer:
“And again I am going to ask you one more time, I am
  not pressuring you I just want to make sure you are thinking clearly so, will
  you submit to the drug recognition evaluation?”
7:25
Defendant:
“No.”
7:27
Officer:
“Ok” - (then he is writing notes)
8:04
Officer:
“So, officer Szok is present - I am going to inform
  you in front of her that you are going to be charged with fail to comply with
  demand in addition to the impaired operation of a conveyance - ok - I will
  get your sweater back, and they will put you back in the cell and do the
  paperwork and get you out of here as quickly as we can. Any questions?”
8:38
Defendant:
(a small sound that I cannot make out)
8:40
Officer:
“No? That’s it.”
[
19
]
Note:  Total time of Evaluating Officer being
with the Defendant is slightly less than 6 minutes.
[
20
]
The Evaluating Officer
’s
testimony began with the usual exercise of ‘qualifying notes’. It became clear
that he did not attempt to begin an
evaluation,
in any way, at any time,
during his contact with the Defendant. Consistent with this his notes were on a
Hamilton Police Service form where he recorded basic information about the
Defendant, grounds, and the demand time. There was also space for Remarks where
he kept some notes.
[
21
]
The Evaluating Officer
did not in any way use the
Drug
Recognition Expert Worksheet
that is the prescribed way of recording an
evaluation
nor did he ever consider doing a
Drug Recognition Narrative Report
which is the other prescribed form in conducting an
evaluation.
(See
paragraph 65 below)
[
22
]
These two documents were not used on this occasion “because the
accused was not willing to participate”. The officer testified that these
documents did not get started because there was no cooperation from the
accused.
[
23
]
His evidence was that:
The Drug Recognition Expert Worksheet
begins upon the
Accused being willing to submit to that process. We don’t start the evaluation
for the
formal drug recognition expert evaluation until the person has said
they are willing to comply and submit to the testing - Otherwise I would be
holding somebody forcing them to do the test
. (Emphasis added)
[
24
]
This enquiry ended with:
Crown:  So, long story short you don’t actually get to do
the test in this case because there is a refusal?
Officer:  Yes, long story short.
[
25
]
Then
the video, transcribed above, was played.
[
26
]
It
was followed by:
Crown: … the audio is not perfectly loud. In terms of her
understanding when you were asking about performing the drug recognition exam
did you take it that she understood what you were explaining to her?
Officer:  It was my opinion that she was comprehending what
I was asking her.
Crown:  Did she submit to the exam?
Officer:  No.
[
27
]
The
Evaluating Officer was asked about his observations of the Defendant’s ‘state’.
He indicated:  her eyes appeared constricted without measurement; her
complexion was a flushed face; while walking she was walking very slowly; she
was speaking with a low voice when responding to questions or when asking
questions; she was shivering; she was slow to get up when leaving; and he
noticed goose bumps.
[
28
]
The
Evaluating Officer was asked some details about his observations with a focus
on the Defendant’s eyes.
Crown:  Sorry, so you didn’t really get a chance to measure
them, is that correct?
Officer:  I cannot start measurements until somebody is
willing to submit to the drug recognition evaluation and I would use then the
pupilometer,
otherwise I would be taking measurements warrantlessly.
(Emphasis
added)
[
29
]
The
Evaluating Officer then advanced an opinion about impairment and by what. I
interrupted this evidence and spoke to the Crown about an admissibility issue.
My position was that the officer was testifying as an expert in conducting an
evaluation and in this case he did not conduct one. For the officer to have an
expert opinion outside of one that was part of an
evaluation
then he
would have to be qualified in some other way. (See paragraph 65 below) The
Crown agreed and asked to include only the officer’s observations as part of
the evidence.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
[
30
]
The
officer was asked if words for the demand were part of his training.  Regarding
his DRE training he said ‘no’ because it is an international evaluation and the
demand changes by country. As far as
in
Canada
is concerned he indicated that it is through basic training and what is printed
on cards and forms from his police service.
[
31
]
The
officer was asked where the passage “because we live in Canada you have a
choice” comes from.
[
32
]
The
officer testified that this was simpler language for the question that is there
[on the form].  He also testified: “To explain on my alcohol influence form the
question that is there in a simpler language [than] ‘will you submit to the
drug evaluation?’”.
[
33
]
I
note the following exchange:
Defence Counsel:  So, that’s not part of your training to
become a Drug Recognition Expert that you should tell somebody the choice to
refuse or to agree to the demand that is being made
Officer:  In the drug recognition program, no, but as a
police officer informing somebody if they are going to be committing an offence
[
34
]
Further,
I note this exchange:
Defence Counsel:  Was there any thought, in terms of having
her start doing some steps and seeing if she agrees to doing those steps?
Officer:
No because if she doesn’t want to do it now I’m
holding her against her will to do something she didn’t want to do.
(Emphasis added)
[
35
]
The
officer agreed that he did not ask about medical conditions and he testified it
would have come up as part of the Drug Recognition Evaluation. Otherwise, he
would have asked about this if he was told something or noticed something. He
explained that, in the Drug Recognition Evaluation, part of what happens is
medical conditions can be ruled in, or out, or partially in or out, with
different tests. He was able to provide basic textbook answers as to how to
deal with a medical issue but he did not engage in this, given he did not start
an
evaluation
.
[
36
]
He
was asked about the lack of responses from the Defendant on the video tape
particularity around the six-minute mark. It was suggested that a couple of
times the Defendant did not answer. The officer said the Defendant was speaking
low and he noted this as part of his description of her. He also said that the
auditory system was not the best. He asserted that she did answer every
question.
COMMENTS
[
37
]
The
Evaluating Officer testified that the Defendant answered every question.  After
listening to, and watching the video I cannot accept this testimony, especially
as it concerns any alleged response between 6 minutes and 13 seconds up to 7
minutes and 25 seconds.  During this time the word “no” can be heard twice
(6:43 and 7:25).  Otherwise there is silence and one small sound. Further one
cannot see anything to indicate that she was speaking. (eg. one cannot see her
lips moving) The impact of this finding is that after the Defendant said “I
don’t even know what that means” at 4 minutes 24 seconds, there is no evidence
to support a suggestion that she understood the question posed: “Will you
submit to the drug recognition evaluation?”
[
38
]
The
following is clear from the Evaluating Officer’s evidence:
(a)
He was familiar with the demand used by the Arresting Officer because he
repeated the same demand at the 6:49 mark. He prefaced this demand by saying “I
am going to read you the demand one more time” when this was the first time he
had read it and this was after his 3rd repetition of “Will you submit to the
drug recognition evaluation?”, in the course of 2ish minutes.
(b)
Based upon the Hamilton Police Service form, he
would not
even
consider going forward with his role as the
evaluating officer
involved
in the case, without a statement from the Defendant, wherein she affirmatively
agreed that she would submit to an
evaluation
.
(c)
He believed that he
could not
legally go forward, with his duty
as the
evaluating officer
to conduct an
evaluation
, without a
statement from the Defendant that she agreed to submit to an
evaluation
.
(d)
In other words, if he simply went forward based on the demand used by
the Arresting Officer and that he used at 6 minute 49 second mark on the video,
without this statement from the defendant:
•
he
would be ‘holding somebody forcing them to do the test’;
•
he
would ‘be taking measurements warrantlessly’; and
•
If
she did not want to do it he would be holding her against her will to do
something she did not want to do.
(e)
He testified that the same Form is used in the case of breath demands
and as a breath technician he would ask a similar question of subjects who came
to him pursuant to a breath demand.
iii) The Defendant’s evidence
[
39
]
The
Defendant, who is 37, testified that about a week and a half before the offence
date she had gall bladder surgery. By the offence date she had just started
walking but was still having difficulty doing so. Also, she had medication for
pain and her mental health. But for the problems from the gall bladder
surgery,
she described her overall health as good.
[
40
]
During
the day that preceded her arrest in front of St. Joseph’s Hospital, she had
been driving her own vehicle, a Jeep, to go grocery shopping with her partner.
Another car swerved into her lane, and as
a result
of
this her vehicle went up on a curb and hit a pole. The air bags did not deploy
and she hit her head on the steering wheel.
[
41
]
The
police were called. A very brief police report has been filed, on consent. It
indicates a collision on February 19, 2024 at 18:23 hours where police, fire
and ambulance attended.
[
42
]
The
Defendant testified that she was briefly checked out by the ambulance. Given
all of the adrenaline she was experiencing she thought she was okay. She and
her partner took a cab home and her vehicle had to be towed, due to the damage.
[
43
]
At
home she tried to relax but in the early evening her partner had a mental health
breakdown and with the assistance of police he was taken to St. Joseph’s
Hospital. Meanwhile, she was starting to feel the impact of the accident. Her
upper incision hurt, she had a headache, and bruising was starting to show
around her eyes and her nose was swelling.
[
44
]
Around
midnight her partner called from the hospital because he was released and he
wanted a ride home.
[
45
]
The
Defendant testified that given she didn’t have her own vehicle because of the
accident, she took a car, a Chevy Cobalt, that she had purchased for
her
son when he got his G2, that she didn’t use, and
headed to St. Joseph’s to pick up her partner.
[
46
]
The
Defendant recalls being woken up by police. She recalls having what she thought
was a weed pipe in her hand that she had discovered sitting on the front
passenger seat during the drive. She had not seen it before and she was
planning to question her partner about it when he arrived in the car, as she
had seen him going out to the car previously.
[
47
]
The
Defendant testified that she did not use illegal drugs.
[
48
]
The
Defendant with regard to her contact with police recalls:  the pipe dropping;
feeling scared; asking the officer to be careful because of her surgery and
being told not to talk as there was video and audio in the cruiser; being taken
to the mountain station (i.e. Station 30); asking for a
lawyer, Ms. Stevenson, sometime
after being at the scene (time
not clear to me); and being put in a cell. I note that these were points with
little or no narrative.
[
49
]
The
Defendant testified that she does not remember any conversation with the breath
tech, even after watching the video. (Note:  Obviously this is a reference to
the Evaluating Officer)
[
50
]
The
Defendant’s next memory is the fingerprint room. It is agreed this would have
been later, at Central Station.
[
51
]
The
Defendant recalls being released from Central Station and that they (i.e. the
police) drove her home.
[
52
]
The
Defendant testified that she continued to feel unwell. She was feeling dizzy
and had a severe headache. Two days later she went to Urgent Care at St.
Joseph’s where a doctor told her that her nose was broken, she had bruised ribs
and tailbone and she had a concussion.
[
53
]
She
rested and took medical leave as she kept passing out. When she went out she
took a bus. At least one time on the bus she passed out and went far past her
stop.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
[
54
]
The
Defendant was cross-examined about finding the pipe. The Defendant explained
this and I am not going to review details further given the Crown later agreed
that it belonged to her partner and that he did not need to be called about
this or the accident earlier in the day.
[
55
]
It
also became apparent that the Defendant could not remember:  the time of the
video clip above regarding the search outside of the
cruiser;
the drive to the mountain station and the sally-port; or the trip to the
second station.
[
56
]
She
agreed that she was intelligent, educated and familiar with the justice system
and that operating a vehicle with a substance would be a criminal offence.
COMMENT
[
57
]
I
found that the Defendant was a credible witness. Her evidence was internally
consistent, is confirmed on key points and is unchallenged in other areas.
C. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES
i) Statutory Interpretation of ‘
evaluation
’
and ‘
evaluating officer’
in the Impaired by Drug provisions in the
Criminal
Code
[
58
]
In an impaired by drug case, regardless of whether alcohol may
also be involved, the demand made by a peace officer is pursuant to Section
320.28(2)(a). This demand at its core is a demand that a person submit to an
evaluation
conducted by an
evaluating officer.
[
59
]
In a recent judgment,
R. v Takov
,
2025 ONCJ 316
[1]
,
I explored the statutory interpretation of
evaluation
and
evaluating
officer
and some of the things that flow from that interpretation.
[
60
]
In
Takov
I found
that the statutory interpretation
of an
evaluation
, in Section 320.28(2)(a), and related sections, is a
very specific evaluation, and that it is the
12-Step Drug Influence
Evaluation
(
12-Step DIE
)
as determined by the
International
Association of Chiefs of Police - Drug Evaluation and Classification Program.
[2]
[
61
]
Further, an
evaluating officer
is an officer that is
a Certified Drug Recognition (DRE) expert accredited by the International
Association of Chiefs of Police.
[3]
[
62
]
The
12-Step DIE
can be found in the training manuals used
for the Certification Program for
Drug Recognition Experts
certified by
the
International Association of Chiefs of Police - Drug Evaluation and
Classification Program.
[
63
]
There
are two manuals. These manuals are the Participant Manuals for officers
enrolled in the Drug Evaluation and Classification Program, which if completed
successfully, along with completing supervised testing, results in
certification of
Drug Recognition Experts (DRE)
by the
International
Association of Chiefs of Police
. Note:   The Evaluating Officer in this case
has been certified through this process. These manuals [2023] are:
i)

Classification Program - Participant Manual (abbreviated to
‘P.S.’
in
citations below)
ii)
DRE:  Drug Recognition Expert 7-Day School — Participant Manual
(abbreviated to
‘7 Day’

of the US Department of
Transportation, at

.
[
65
]
Some
key concepts from the
12-Step DIE
are:
•
The
12-Step DIE
is more than a list of twelve steps. Each
Step
is a
very detailed and fully standardized procedure
[4]
•
These
Steps
were reviewed in detail
in
Takov
[5]
•
The
Drug Recognition Expert (DRE)
evaluating officer’s
expertise when
administering/conducting an
evaluation
is defined by the
12-Step DIE
and
they have no expertise that allows them to add, change, or ignore any part or
how it is to be conducted
[6]
•
This
includes the fact that any opinion evidence offered by an
evaluating officer
comes from the
12-Step DIE
at Step 11 – Opinion of Evaluator
[7]
•
It
follows that if any other opinion evidence is proffered it would be necessary
to have a
voir dire
to determine its admissibility
•
DRE’s
are trained to prepare two reports:  Drug Influence Evaluation; and Drug Influence
Evaluation Narrative
[8]
[
66
]
Regarding
the current case some specific points from the
12-Step DIE
include:
•
It
is
not
part of the
12-Step DIE,
to ask the subject, at any point,
anything along the lines of:  Do you agree to submit to an evaluation?
•
The
12-Step DIE
says very little about a subject ‘refusing’. It stresses
doing the standardized procedure the same way each time and basically carrying
on in that manner. Specially, the following is stated:
-
DREs should always try to conduct the 12-step process in the same manner
each time. If there is deviation from the 12-step process, it should be noted
in the narrative report. DREs should make every effort to conduct a complete
post arrest drug influence evaluation for every drug impaired driver, whether
they are the arresting officer or not. However, there may be times when DREs
begin the 12-step process, but are unable to complete it (for example,
uncooperative
subject
, equipment failure, or
refusals
). DREs should document all
available evidence and observations in their report.
[9]
(Emphasis added)
-
Whenever possible, DREs should conduct the entire drug influence
evaluation in accordance with DEC Program training.
[10]
(Emphasis in original) (Note:  DEC stands for the program’s name - Drug
Evaluation and Classification)
-
Circumstances may warrant a DRE to perform a step out of sequence or the
suspect may be unable, or
refuses
, to perform part of the evaluation. If
this occurs, the DRE should document the circumstances in their narrative
report.
[11]
(Emphasis added)
ii) Elements of Failure or Refusal
to Comply
[
67
]
The starting point is the Demand section:
Section 320.28(2)(a) - If a peace officer has reasonable
grounds to believe that a person has operated a conveyance while the person’s
ability to operate it was impaired to any degree by a drug or a by a
combination of alcohol and a drug, or has committed an offence under
paragraph
320.14(1)
(c) or (d) or subsection 320.14(4), the
peace officer may by demand
,
made as soon as practicable
require the person to comply with the
requirements of
either or both of paragraphs
(a)
and (b):
(a)
To submit
, as soon as
practicable,
to an evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer
to
determine whether the person’s ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a
drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug, and to accompany the peace
officer for that purpose.
(Emphasis added)
[
68
]
The
Failure or Refusal to Comply With Demand section is:
320.15(1) Everyone commits an offence who, knowing that a
demand has been made, fails or refuses to comply, without reasonable excuse,
with a demand made under 320.27 or 320.28.
[
69
]
As
summarized in
Impaired Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving
Offences
[12]
the elements of this offence are:  (Footnotes not reproduced)
This offence involves three elements:
i)
A
valid demand
(Emphasis added)
ii)
The
actus
reus,
which is a failure or refusal to provide the requisite sample, and
iii)
The
mens rea,
which
is either knowledge that the demand has been made or that the accused intended
to produce the failure or refusal
Where the Crown has proved all three elements, the accused
may escape liability if they have a reasonable excuse for refusing or failing
to provide the sample.
[
70
]
The
above summary is obviously constructed around the case law for Failure to Provide
Breath Sample which shares the same
Criminal Code
section. Given the
lack of case law regarding Refuse Evaluation Demand, this is a solid starting
point but some adjustments need to be made in the wording. This is also true
with what follows below. I will wait until the Analysis to make any necessary
adjustments.
[
71
]
When
doing the Analysis in this case I also found it helpful to keep first
principles in mind.
[
72
]
As
summarized in
Impaired Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences
at
page 79.
[13]
The Supreme Court of Canada, in the 2017 case of
R. v
Alex
,
concisely explained the difference in the criminal liability between
the refusal offence and other drugged driving or drinking and driving offences:
While the refusal offence is part of the same statutory
regime, it is different from other drinking and driving offences in substance. 
Culpability for the refusal offence is
based on disobedience with lawful
compulsion
, whereas culpability for an “over 80” office is based on driving
with a blood-alcohol concentration over the legal limit.
[14]
(Emphasis added)
A
VALID DEMAND
[
73
]
A
valid demand is the first element. The Crown must prove:
i)
The statutory
preconditions for the demand, and
ii)
The officer
communicated a demand to the accused
[
74
]
Regarding
i), i.e. the statutory preconditions for the demand, as summarized in
Impaired
Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences,
[15]
:
The Crown must prove that the statutory preconditions
existed for making the demand
[16]
The Supreme Court noted in
Alex
that the need to prove the preconditions
arises out of the nature of the offence rather than the text of the section:
First, the textual argument
assumes that the language of s. 254(5) requires the lawfulness of the demand to
be an element of the offence.  In my view, however, this element is better
thought of as arising from
the general nature of the refuse offence—an
offence which criminalizes disobedience in response to lawful compulsion.
Notwithstanding the words “made under” disobedience with unlawful compulsion is
simply not criminal.
[17]
(Emphasis added)
[
75
]
Regarding
ii), i.e. officer communicated a demand to accused, as summarized in
Impaired
Driving and other Criminal Code Driving Offences
[18]
:
No particular wording is required for a valid demand. The demand
must convey that the person must comply and provide the sample. This can be
accomplished through words or conduct, including the tenor of the officer’s
discussion with the accused.  …. The officer must make a “demand,” not a
“request.” Requests such as “Would you please provide a sample?” Do you wish to
take the test?” Are not unequivocal demands.  Refusing to comply with a request
isn’t an offence. ….” (Footnotes not reproduced)
D. ANALYSES
i) What is involved, from the
subject’s point of view, when submitting to an
evaluation
?
[
76
]
A breath sample demand requires 1 or 2 (depending on which
demand) suitable samples of the subject’s breath into a specific instrument.
This is a broadly understood concept. Compliance with a demand for an
evaluation
by an
evaluating officer
involves multiple things and multiple ways of
‘submitting’ to the demand. I have taken the details of what the
DRE/evaluating
officer
is expected to do in the
12-Step DIE,
that I reviewed in
Takov
,
and ‘reverse engineered’ the requirements to be from the subject’s point of
view.
[
77
]
To comply with the demand the subject must:
•
(Step 1 - Breath
Alcohol Test)
-
Submit by providing a
single breath sample
•
(Step 2 - Interview of
arresting officer)
-
No action required by
subject
•
(
Step 3 -
Preliminary Examination and first pulse)
-
Submit by answering a
series of questions dealing with possible injuries or medical problems
-
Submit by acquiescing
(as in tacitly accepting the officer’s actions) to the
evaluating officer
looking closely into the subject’s eyes to make a preliminary observation of
the pupils
-
Submit by acquiescing
to the
evaluating officer
to taking a pulse
-
Submit by following
instructions to watch the movements of a stimulus (eg. a pen) held by the
evaluating
officer
•
(Step 4 - Eye
Examinations)
-
Submit by following
instructions to watch the movements of a stimulus
i)
Side to side
ii)
Up and down
iii)
Toward the nose
•
(Step 5 - Divided
Attention Tests:  Modified Romberg Balance; Walk and Turn; One leg stand;
Finger to Nose)
-
Submit by listening to
standardized instructions and then following these instructions by:
i)
Standing
with feet together and
tilting head back slightly with eyes closed
ii)
While in this position
estimating 30 seconds and when at the 30 second estimate opening eyes, tilting
head forward and saying ‘stop’
-
Submit by listening to
standardized instructions and then following these instructions by:
i)
Standing on a line on
the floor, heel to toe, right foot in front with arms at side while receiving
standardized instructions for the next phase
ii)
Taking nine heel-to-toe
steps on the line (while watching feet) turning around keeping the front or
lead foot on the line and turning by taking a series of small steps with the
other foot, and then returning with nine heel-to-toe steps down the line
-
Submit by listening to
standardized instructions and then following these instructions by:
i)
Raising right leg
approximately 6 inches off the ground, with the right foot parallel to the
ground, then while looking at the right foot counting ‘one thousand and one,
one thousand and two etc’. (The
evaluating officer
says stop after 30
seconds have passed)
ii)
Repeating the above
with left leg (i.e. listen to instructions and follow these instructions)
-
Submit by listening to
standardized instructions and then following these instructions by:
i)
Assuming a specific
posture (re. body and arms) and closing one’s eyes and then move the tip of an
index finger to the tip of one’s nose when instructed to do so. This is done
six times (three times on each side)
•
(Step 6 - Vital Signs
and second pulse)
-
Submit by acquiescing
to the
evaluating officer
taking pulse
-
Submit by acquiescing
to the
evaluating officer
taking temperature
-
Submit by acquiescing
to the
evaluating officer
taking blood pressure
•
(Step 7 - Dark Room
Examinations)
-
Submit by sitting still
and keeping eyes open while
evaluating officer
is close enough to hold a
pupillometer to the side of the head, next to each eye separately, in three
lighting conditions:  room light; near total darkness; and direct light (i.e.
while shining a light into the eye)
•
(Step 8 - Check for
muscle tone)
-
Submit by acquiescing
to
evaluating officer
to touching forearms and pressing against muscle
in arm
•
(Step 9 - Check for
injection sties and third pulse)
-
Submit by acquiescing
to
evaluating officer
inspecting forearms
-
Submit by acquiescing
to
evaluating officer
taking pulse
•
(Step 10 -
Interrogation, statements, and other observations)
-
There
may
be an
additional questions asked at this stage. For the purposes of the current issue,
I have chosen not to review this step.
•
(Step 11 - Opinion of
Evaluator)
-
No action required by
the subject unless the opinion results in
a
urine sample demand. As this is a
separate demand I have chosen not to review it as part of the current issue.
•
(Step 12 - Toxicological
examination)
-
No action required by
the subject.
ii) Did the Crown prove the
statutory preconditions for the demand?
[
78
]
At
the time the original demand was made, by the Arresting Officer, the answer to
this question is ‘yes’. More specifically under section 320.28(2)(a) the
Arresting Officer had the grounds set out in the section and then she gave a
demand using the words of the same section.
[
79
]
However,
this does not end the matter. I find that the Evaluating Officer required  that
the Defendant make a statement affirming that she would submit to an
evaluation
by an
evaluating officer
(referred to as
statement
below), and in
so doing he was, in fact, making an additional demand.
[
80
]
The
grounds for this second demand remained the same as the original demand, but
what the second demand purported to compel, i.e. the
statement,
significantly
impacted the first demand.
[
81
]
My
reasons for finding that requiring this
statement
from the Defendant
rose to the level of being a ‘demand’ made by a police officer, as opposed to
something lesser are:
•
After going over preliminaries (i.e. Right to Counsel, cautions
and “Do you understand that the officer has demanded that a drug recognition
evaluation be conducted?), the Evaluating Officer went immediately to: “Will
you submit to the drug recognition evaluation?”
•
The Evaluating Officer basically began the substantive part of
his interaction with the Defendant with this question. He returned to the
question 3 times. Three minutes passed between the first and the last (i.e.
4th) time. Throughout the three minutes, the primary topic, directly or
indirectly, was about the Defendant providing an answer to the question.
•
The Evaluating Officer, through his words and tone, was
unequivocal about the fact that the question needed to be answered, that it was
a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, and not answering was clearly not an option.
•
The Evaluating Officer clearly communicated that answering ‘yes’
had to happen before an
evaluation
would be done.
[
82
]
Further,
there is nothing to support characterizing the Evaluating Officer’s words in
any other way, given:
•
They
are not from the
12-Step DIE
/
evaluation
(See paragraph 66 above)
•
They
are inconsistent with the instructions in the
12-Step DIE/evaluation
(See
paragraph 66 above)
•
The
Evaluating
Officer’s evidence confirms that he did not, would not, and thought he could
not, begin the
evaluation
without a statement from the Defendant
affirming that she would submit to an
evaluation
conducted by an
evaluating
officer
.
[
83
]
The
Evaluating Officer kept the two demands separate when speaking to the Defendant,
but looking at how they come together, in the circumstances of this case, his
de
facto
demand was the following:
I demand that you submit to an
evaluation conducted by an Evaluating Officer by:
(a)
Providing a statement affirming
that you will submit to an evaluation by an Evaluating Officer; and
(b)
Upon the completion of
(a) submit to an evaluation by an Evaluating Officer
in order to determine whether your ability to
operate a conveyance is impaired by a drug or a combination of a drug and
alcohol and that you accompany me for that purpose.
[
84
]
This
de facto
demand is not a section 320.28(2)(a) demand, nor is it any
other demand in the
Criminal Code
. The fact that the Evaluating Officer
delivered it in two parts does not change this conclusion.
[
85
]
Given this:
•
The Crown did not prove the first aspect of proving the ‘valid
demand’ element of the refuse offence (i.e. the Crown did not prove the
statutory conditions of the demand)
•
This demand does not amount to ‘lawful compulsion’ as referred to
in
R. v Alex
(See paragraph
72
above)
•
In the circumstances, it was ‘unlawful compulsion’
•
Disobedience with ‘unlawful compulsion’ is not a crime (See
paragraph 74 above)
[
86
]
I
find that the Evaluating Officer’s demand
completely subsumed
the
original demand made by the Arresting Officer.
[
87
]
In
light of this finding, and given my ruling about the Evaluating Officer’s
demand, this ends the case because the Crown did not prove part of an essential
element of the Refuse offence.
[
88
]
I
recognize, as submitted by the Crown, that there are cases of ‘outright
refusal’.  These cases are based on factual findings about the
actus rea
,
by a court, based upon a defendant’s words and behaviour. They are not about the
‘valid demand’ element. Further, this is not an ‘outright refusal’ case on its
facts. During the time that the Defendant was subject to the Arresting Officer’s
demand, for approximately one and a half hours, the Defendant was compliant.
The only thing that changed was her getting entangled in the Evaluating Officer’s
invalid demand.
[
89
]
Given
that the evidence suggests that what happened here is common practice, driven
by a standard form of the Hamilton Police Service, I also note that the
question of concern (i.e. will you submit to the drug recognition evaluation?),
on this form, is unfortunate for the
evaluating officers
, given it can
apparently cause them to think that they do not have authority to do what the
Criminal
Code
says they can do pursuant to Section 320.28(2)(a).
[
90
]
Further,
the question on the form is outrageously unfair to the person who is subject to
the demand. As this case illustrates the Evaluating Officer’s insistence that
he would not move forward with his lawful duties to conduct an
evaluation
,
in a bazaar twist, became the responsibility of the Defendant and that in turn
resulted in her being charged.
CONCLUSION
[
91
]
The
Crown did not prove the statutory preconditions for the demand.
iii) Did the Crown prove the officer communicated a
demand to the accused?
[
92
]
The
only way this question remains relevant is if I was wrong above, when I decided
that the Arresting Officer’s demand was completely subsumed  by the Evaluating
Officer’s
demand. If instead, the Arresting Officer’s demand remained
in place, then this question needs to be examined.
[
93
]
As
reviewed above (See paragraph 75) no particular wording is required for the
demand. The Arresting Officer used the words from her notebook and they were
basically drawn from the
Criminal Code
.
[
94
]
Generally
speaking, one would anticipate, based on case law developed through various
types of breath demand cases, that this would be sufficient to show that the
officer communicated a demand.
[
95
]
There
are a couple of major problems however. One is a general problem and the second
one is case specific.
[
96
]
The
general problem arises from the fact that case law requires that a demand be
unequivocal. In other words, it should leave no doubt,
objectively
speaking, about the ‘lawful compulsion’ involved.
[
97
]
Essentially,
a demand  communicates to the subject that he/she will be ‘
compelled
’ to
‘
do something
’. Without both parts being clear it is logically
impossible for any proposed demand to be unequivocal.
[
98
]
The
case law regarding this has focused on  the ‘
compelled
’ part. So, for
example, a ‘request’ is not a ‘demand’.
[
99
]
Case
law has not focused on the ‘
do something
’ part. Presumably, this is
because the case law has been about various breath demands and the words from
the
Criminal Code
including ‘provide a sample of your breath’. These
words are commonly understood by the public, and do not raise an issue about
what is being compelled and in turn about the demand being unequivocal.
[
100
]
In contrast, in
drug impaired cases, the words from the
Criminal Code
for the demand are
‘
submit to an evaluation
conducted by an evaluating officer’. (See paragraph
67 above)
[
101
]
I find that
realistically, on an objective basis,  the words,
‘submit to an evaluation’
,
do not
communicate what the subject is ‘compelled’ to
‘do’
.
[
102
]
It follows that
the words ‘submit to an evaluation’
do not
result in an unequivocal
demand.
[
103
]
Unlike ‘provide
a sample of your breath’, these words require a specific knowledge about what
is meant by them and it cannot be expected that they would be understood by
others who do not have the specific knowledge.
[
104
]
To say otherwise
would be dishonest, especially given:
•
There is no definition of an
evaluation
in the
Criminal
Code
and its current
Regulations
and it is only through statutory
interpretation that one can conclude that an
evaluation
is the
12-Step
DIE,
of the
International Association of Chief’s of Police
[19]
•

DRE/evaluating officer

acknowledged by the Supreme Court of Canada as being outside the experience and
knowledge of the trier of fact.
[20]
If triers of fact need this assistance, then how can a trier of fact possibly
assert that the subject of the demand that uses the words of the section can
reasonably be expected to know what they are compelled
to do
?
[
105
]
Given the above,
I am unable to find that the Arresting Officer’s demand was unequivocal.
[
106
]
This appears to
be a very unsatisfactory result, because if one stopped at this point this
ruling would have a negative implication in all cases with the same demand.
[
107
]
The way this
problem is resolved in most cases is that the demand, in effect, goes into a
holding pattern as the subject accompanies an officer(s) who essentially
delivers the subject to an
evaluating officer
.
[
108
]
During this
intervening time, a few basic additional things take place, such as search
incident to arrest, and the management of any right to counsel issues, but
there is no investigation involving the subject directly.
[
109
]
Then, when the
subject meets the
evaluating officer,
that officer begins the
evaluation.
This
evaluation,
that is sanctioned by the
Criminal Code
, as
it is administered over time, in a clear and standardized way by an
evaluating
officer
communicates to the subject the multiple things ‘compelled’ by the
words ‘
submit to an evaluation’.
[
110
]
The delay in
perfecting the demand in this way simply cannot be avoided. Realistically,
there is no obvious way to communicate the meaning of an
evaluation
in a
comprehensive, clear and understandable way to the subject. No harm comes from
the delay so long as there is no direct investigation of the subject (or
additional demands, as in this case).
[
111
]
In my view, in
the above scenario, the initial problem of the demand not being unequivocal is
cured by the standard instructions in the
evaluation
. As a result, the
Crown could prove that the officer communicated a demand to the accused.
[
112
]
This scenario
did not happen with the Defendant because an
evaluation
was never
started, much less completed. As a result, the communication of a demand was
never perfected/completed.
[
113
]
I should also
review the fact that when the Evaluating Officer asked the Defendant “Will you
submit to the drug recognition evaluation?”, she replied “I don’t even know
what that means.” This was followed by a long response from the Evaluating Officer
and the only words in that response about what an
evaluation
was were:
“So, the drug recognition evaluation is a 12-step process, a number of tests
that I put you through, divided attentions tests as well as clinical tests…”
[
114
]
Did the Evaluating
Officer’s response perfect the demand and make it unequivocal? I find that
objectively it did not. His response was incomplete, vague and used words that
one would need specialized knowledge to understand.
[
115
]
The Crown
pointed to the fact that the Evaluating Officer testified that the Defendant
understood. One cannot look at the video and agree that she spoke words to this
effect. (See paragraph 37 above) More importantly, this is a red herring. This
issue is not about the defendant’s state of mind or her
mens rea
when she
said ‘no’.
[
116
]
The issue is
whether the demand was unequivocal and given the
evaluation
that could
have perfected the Arresting Officer’s demand did not take place, the answer is
‘no’.
CONCLUSION
[
117
]
The
Crown did not prove that the officer (Arresting Officer and/or Evaluating
Officer) communicated a demand to the accused.
E. CONCLUSION
[
118
]
Given
the two conclusions in the section above, I find that the Crown did not prove a
valid demand, which is the first of the three elements of the Refuse to Comply
With Demand offence. (Note:  Either of the two conclusions alone leads to the
same outcome. They are not co-dependent)
