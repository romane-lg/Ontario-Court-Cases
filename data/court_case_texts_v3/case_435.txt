BEFORE THE
HONOURABLE JUSTICE M. HORNBLOWER
On
February 18, 2025, at SARNIA, Ontario
APPEARANCES
:
S. CARMODY
counsel
for the Crown
K. MARLEY
counsel for J.G.
HORNBLOWER, J
: (Orally)
J.G.
is the half-brother of C.W. J.G. is 5 1/2 years older than C.W. Between the
time he was 13 and 18 he committed a number of sexual assaults on C.W. These
began when W.C. was eight years of age and ended when she was 13.
The
first instance of sexual activity began when they were eight and 13 years of
age respectively. J.G. engaged in a game with C.W. whereby he would be bouncing
her up and down on his lap. This activity initially occurred in open settings.
Eventually the activities became sexual in nature and occurred in his bedroom.
On at least one instance he removed her clothing and engaged in sexual activity
with her. Thereafter he performed various sexual acts on her and forced her to
perform sexual acts on him. These activities occurred in various places in the
family home including the bedrooms of each of them. J.G. would often tell C.W.
not to tell anyone or they would both get in trouble and that he would be taken
out of the home. At times he spoke to her in a derogatory nature referring to
her as my little slut. At times C.W. resisted the activities and at other times
would go along with them simply to get them over with.
Eventually
she
went
along
with
the
activities
because
it
just
seemed
normal
to
her.
Some
of
the
incidents
were
physically
painful
for
her.
On
some
occasions
it
was
simply
a
number
of
weeks
between
the
incidents
and
at
others
a
period
of
months.
The
sexual
assaults
continued
over
a
period
of
five
years.
The
most
recent
activities
occurred
on
three
occasions
in
2020,
and
it
is
these
incidents
that
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
two
charges
to
which
he
has
pied
guilty.
The
first
was
in
the
March/April
timeframe,
the
second
in
the
month
of
August
and
the
third
in
the
August/September
timeframe.
In
October
of
2020,
C.W.
mentioned
the
incidents
to
friends
and
ultimately
to
the
police.
Following
that disclosure, J.G. was charged with various offences that occurred while he
was a young offender as well as an adult.
The
incidents
that
occurred
while
J.G.
was
under
the
age
of
18
are
all
acknowledged
as
having
occurred
and
while
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
Court
for
the
purposes
of
sentencing,
they
are
before
the
Court
as
part
of
the
context
for consideration in sentencing him as an
adult.
It is agreed that where the
facts make reference to sexual activities, they include touching and oral sex
but do not involve penetrative sex.
The
procedural
history
of
this
matter
is
of
importance.
Pleas
to
the
adult
charges
were
initially
entered
in
front
of
another
judge
to
get
a
pre-sentence
report
prepared.
The
matter
then
returned
before
me
for
sentence
on
February
12,
2024.
At
that
time,
the
Crown
read
a
set
of
facts
into
the
record,
and
they
were
agreed
to
by
counsel
for
J.G.,
and
a
finding
of
guilt
was
entered.
We
then
embarked
on
the
sentence
hearing
with
the
introduction
of
the
victim
impact
statement
from
C.W..
At
the
conclusion
of
the
statement
being
read
into
evidence,
a
brief
recess
followed.
When
court
resumed,
counsel
for
J.G.
indicated
that
he
was
now
instructed
to
take
exception
to
some
of
the
facts
that
were
placed
before
the
Court
following
the
guilty
plea.
A
very
detailed
set
of
facts
had
been
placed
before
the
Court.
In
that
recitation
of
the
facts,
some
of
the
incidents
were
described
as
including
forced
vaginal
intercourse
as
well
as
anal
intercourse.
There
were
at
least
six
acts
of
either
vaginal
or
anal
intercourse
as
well
as
acts
involving
digital
penetration.
With the facts now in dispute, the
matter was adjourned to allow counsel for the defense to consider the next
steps given the disagreement over the facts.
Ultimately,
Mr.
Marley
was
retained
as
counsel.
Various
discussions
occurred
between
Crown
and
defence
which
resulted
in
the
facts
being
altered
significantly
to
the
facts
that
are
now
before
me.
Those
facts
are
outlined
in
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
on
guilty
plea,
filed
as
Exhibit
5
on
sentencing.
That
statement
outlines
in
a
number
of
paragraphs
the
abuse
perpetrated
on
C.W.
by
her
brother
before
he
turned
18.
As
it
relates
to
the
two
charges
before
this
Court
for
sentencing,
the
agreed
statement
says
simply
this
in
paragraph
eight:
"The
most
recent
incidents
of
abuse
happened
sometime
in
March
to
April
of
2020,
in
mid-August
2020,
and
sometime
in
August
to
September
of
2020"
After
some
questioning
of
counsel
for
the
Crown
and
the
Defense
as
to
the
nature
of
the
abuse
referred
to
in
paragraph
eight
of
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
the
Court
was
directed
to
page
seven
of
the
Section
34
Assessment,
and
in
particular
the
first
sentence
under
the
heading
"Sexual
Behaviour",
as
follows:
"When
discussing
J.G.’s
sexually
harming
behaviour
that
led
to
his
charges,
he
acknowledged
engaging
in
sexual
touching
and
oral
sex
with
his
sister,
but
no
penetrative intercourse."
After
further
discussions
with
counsel,
it
was
agreed
that
the
charges
on
which
J.G.
is
to
be
sentenced
consist
of
three
acts
of
touching
and
oral
sex.
The
incidents
that
occurred
while
he
was
under
age
18
are
before
me
only
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
overall
context
in
which
the
offences
occurred.
The
factual
scenario
on
which
J.G.
is
to
be
sentenced
does
not
involve
any
instances
of
vaginal
or
anal
intercourse
or
any
instances
of
penetration.
The
original
facts
are
not
before
me
for
consideration,
and
I
have
disabused
myself
of
those
facts,
as
I
must.
It
is
the
position
of
the
Crown
given
the
facts
before
me
now,
a
period
of
incarceration
of
four
years
is
appropriate.
I
would
note
that
the
Crown's
position
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
are
no
longer
before
the
Court
and
are
far
more
egregious,
was
also
four
years.
The defense suggests taking into
account not just the facts but the unique circumstances of J.G., that a
conditional sentence is
appropriate
VICTIM IMPACT
C.W.
has
provided
two
victim
impact
statements.
The
first
is
a
recorded
statement
made
to
the
police
in
advance
of
the
pleas
being
entered.
The
second
was
given
in
court
on
February
12th,
2024,
the
date
the
pleas
were
entered.
In
each
statement,
one
can
hear
the
pain,
the
anguish,
the
confusion,
and
the
torment
that
she
has
suffered
at
the
hands
of
her
big
brother.
While
it
may
not
do
justice
to
the
entirety
of
her
statements,
it
is
important
to
try
and
capture
the
essence
of
what
she
has
described.
In
focusing
on
some
of
what
C.W.
has
described
in
her
statements,
I
do
not
do
so
to
the
exclusion
of
all
that
she
has
said
but
rather
in
an
effort
to
capture
that
essence
of
what
she
has
said.
The
following
are
some
of
her
comments:
•
Piece
by piece little parts of me died until I just didn't fight it anymore;
•
Yes
I survived, but to survive parts of me had to suffer because of what J. did to
me.
My trust, my belief in people,
my innocence was compromised, it hurt me in ways I can't describe;
•
He
made me afraid of everyone, afraid of glances and touches from everyone, even
people I should trust, especially people I should trust;
•
I
was never safe. For a long time, nearly as long as I can remember, I didn't
even know what safety felt like;
•
I
wonder what kind of monster can look at his baby sister, who loved him and
looked up to him and do that;
•
The
mere idea of intimacy still makes me sick to this day, despite the fact that
the abuse stopped years ago; and finally,
•
What
happened to me in that basement and elsewhere in the house was torture and it
will follow me for the rest of my life, and I deserve justice.
C.W.
has
described
that
she
considered
her
brother
J.
and
indeed
all
of
her
brothers
as
superheroes.
Understandably
lost
as
a
result
of
his
actions
are
some
of
the
things
that
a
sister
and
her
big
brother
would
normally
enjoy
and
the
happy
memories
that
would
have
been
created.
C.W.
has
indicated
that
she
does
miss
some
of
the
things
that
one
would
enjoy
with
a
big
brother.
C.W.
has
expressed
that
she
cannot
begin
to
understand
why
her
brother
would
do
such
things
to
her.
That
is
something
she
should
never
have
had
to
try
to
understand.
It
is
something
perhaps
that
will
never
be
understood.
She
grapples
with
many
emotions.
Most compelling perhaps is her description of her
brother
as
a
person
she
loved
so
much
and
yet
who
had
hurt
her
so
much.
There
has
been
a
betrayal
of
trust
and
the
betrayal
of
those
things
that
lie
at
the
heart
of
what
a
family
is
supposed
to
be.
C.W.
suffers
from
post-traumatic
stress
disorder.
A
touch
from
someone,
a
look
from
someone
and
even
words
said
by
someone
can
all
revisit
memories
of
what
has
occurred
to
her.
The
trauma
she
has
experienced
will
be
with
her
for
years
if
not
for
her
entire
life.
Over the period of time, she was subjected to sexually
assaultive behaviour by her brother, C.W. began to resort to self-harm.
At one point, she attempted suicide.
In
her
victim
impact
statement
C.W.
has
indicated
that
she
deserves
justice.
Indeed,
she
does.
She
has
suffered
significantly
from
the
wrongs
done
to
her
by
someone
she
was
entitled
to
believe
would
never
do
her
wrong.
The
determination
of
a
fit
sentence
requires
a
Court
to
consider
a
number
of
factors:
the
impact
on
the
victim,
sentencing
principles
as
outlined
in
the
Criminal
Code,
the
circumstances
of
the
accused,
aggravating
and
mitigating circumstances, as well as the
law.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER
At
the
time
the
offences
were
committed,
J.G.
was
18
years
of
age.
However,
the
sexual
assaults
involving
his
sister
began
at
an
earlier
age,
when
he
was
13,
and
continued
until
he
was 18.
Because
some
of
the
sexual
assaults
occurred
when
he
was
a
young
offender,
charges
were
laid
under
the
Youth
Criminal
Justice
Act
and
as
part
of
those
proceedings,
a
Section
34
Assessment
was
completed
on
July
15th,
2022.
That
assessment
is
before
the
court
as
is
a
pre-sentence
report
dated
September
6th
,
2023.
The
Section
34
Assessment
details
a
number
of
difficulties
that
J.G.
has
experienced
over
the
course
of
his
life,
and
which
he
continues
to
experience
as
an
adult.
From
a
young
age,
he
demonstrated
difficulties
with
self-regulation
including
inattention,
distractibility,
and
impulsivity.
When
he
was
in
grade
seven,
he
was
diagnosed
with
ODD,
ADHD,
disruptive
mood
dysregulation
disorder,
anxiety
disorder,
and
there
was
a
possibility
of
autism
spectrum
disorder.
It
was
noted
that
his
social skills were impaired and that he
did not have the emotional responses that were typical of a child of his age.
The report also notes that
throughout his lifetime
J.G.
has
been
easily
overwhelmed
in
environments
that
are
busy
and
have
many
people.
School
classrooms
were
given
as
an
example
of
those
types
of
environments.
As
a
result
of
that
difficulty,
small
classroom
settings
were
made
available
for
him
in
grades
10
and
11
and
in
those
settings,
he
is
reported
as
having
done
very
well.
However,
when
he
returned
to
a
regular
classroom
for
either
grade
11
or
grade
12
it
appears
the
difficulty
with
such
an
environment
surfaced
again
with
the
result
that
he
quit
school
at
age
18.
While
there
was
some
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
autism
spectrum
disorder
diagnosis,
it
appears
from
the
assessment
that
that
diagnosis
was
eventually
confirmed.
Page
11
of
the
report
notes
that
J.
demonstrates
many
features
associated
with
autism
spectrum
disorder
and
goes
on
to
list
many
of
the
deficits
he
has
experienced
all
of
which
are
consistent
with
ASD.
At
page
18,
the
report
notes
as
follows:
"[J.G.’s]
diagnosis
of
ASD
can
explain
in
part
his
difficulties
with
understanding
social
cues
and
understanding
the
impact
of
his
behaviour
on
others.
[J.G.]
also
struggles
with
social
cognition,
which
can
be
a
barrier
in
the development of
appropriate healthy sexual relationships.
Additionally,
[J.G.]
exhibits
challenges
with
executive
functioning,
which
can
play
a
role
in
difficulties
with
regulating
emotions,
acting
impulsively,
and
not
appropriately
considering
the
consequences
of
his
actions.
Moving
forward
it
will
be
important
for
him
to
have
intervention
and
support
for
his
challenges,
but
to
also
be
held
accountable
for
inappropriate
behaviour."
J.G.’s
difficulties
functioning
with
other
people
are
highlighted
in
the
report.
The
report
notes
that
when
he
was
interviewed
for
the
assessment,
he
demonstrated
an
anxious
presentation,
had
long
hair
which
he
indicated
he
sometimes
used
to
hide
behind
during
social
interactions.
He
expressed
that
being
seen
by
others
makes
him
feel
nervous.
He
shared
that
he
finds
socializing
difficult
and
needs
advanced
notice
to
prepare
for
social
interactions
with
others.
He
also
expressed
concern
that
he
requires
time,
several
days,
to
process
and
recover
from
the
interactions.
He
expressed
a
negative
view
of
people
overall.
He
conveyed
that
he
views
people
as
disgusting
like
bugs.
He
experienced
school
as
not
pleasant
due
to
the peer difficulties and overwhelming
environment.
Family members have likewise commented on his
inability
to
socialize
with
others.
His
grandmother
describes
him
as
being
nonfunctional
in
social
settings,
being
overly
shy
or
unable
to
manage
being
in
a
room
with
a
lot
of
people.
His
brother
notes
him
as
being
nonsocial.
The
Section
34
Assessment
notes
that
consistent
with
this,
has
never
been
employed
nor
does
he
have
career
goals.
It
also
notes
at
page
10,
with
respect
to
his
emotional
functioning
and
personality,
that
"results
suggested
that
[J.G.]
tends
to
act
helpless
and
seek
nurturance
from
others
in
a
childlike
and
a
passive
manner.
A
characteristically
depressive
mood
including
a
pessimistic
outlook
was
indicated.
[J.G.]
appears
to
relate
to
others
with
little
enthusiasm.
His
capacity
to
enjoy
life
appears
compromised
by
his
apathy
and
sadness.
Significant
symptoms
of
anxiety
and
somatic
complaints
were
also
in
evidence.
There
was
also
a
suggestion
of
a
recent
psychotic
episode
involving
periods
of
regressive
behavior,
physical
impassivity
and
the
suppression
of
emotional
expression
and
behavioural
initiative.
This
may
serve
to
deflect
unexpected
social
pressures
or
anxieties."
The
assessment
also
notes
frequent
suicidal
ideation
by
J.G.
which
ideation
he
explains
as
resulting
from
the
fact:
"I don't like me."
There
do
not
appear
to
be
any
concerns
with
respect
to
his
intellectual
capacity.
When
in
school,
he
demonstrated
an
aptitude
for
many
of
his
courses.
J.G.
has
acknowledged
knowing
that
what
he
did
was
wrong.
The
Section
34
Assessment
notes
that
while
he
regrets
his
harmful
behaviour
with
his
sister,
he
does
not
demonstrate
much
empathy
towards
her.
Concerns
are
expressed
that
a
risk
analysis
places
him
at
medium
risk
for
re
involvement
in
the
justice
system
for
general
offenses,
and
at
high
risk
for
sexual
offence
specific
recidivism.
The
author
of
the
pre-sentence
report
expresses
concern
that
he
has
not
engaged
in
any
type
of
assessment
to
explore
his
sexual
interests
or
any
counselling
to
mitigate
the
risk
of
sexual
offending.
THE LAW
The
approach
to
sentencing
for
offenders
who
have
sexually
assaulted
a
child
is
now
governed
by
the
principles
outlined
by
the
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
in
R.
v.
Friesen
2020
sec
9.
I
do
not
intend
to
review
these
principles
in
detail
as
part
of
these
reasons.
Suffice
it
to
say,
the
sentencing
regime
now
recognizes
that
in assessing a
fit sentence, a court needs to focus on the physical harm, as well as the
emotional and
psychological
harm
caused
to
the
child
and
recognize
that
even
a
single
instance
of
sexual
violence
can
permanently
alter
the
course
of
a
child's
life.
In
considering
the
harm
to
the
victim,
it
includes
harms
that
have
not
yet
materialized
but
are
reasonably
foreseeable.
The
principles
of
denunciation
and
deterrence
are
prioritized.
Other
sentencing
objectives
can
still
be
given
significant
weight
so
long
as
they
are
not
elevated
to
equal
or
higher
priority.
At
the
same
time,
courts
are
not
to
disregard
relevant
factors
that
may
reduce
an
offender's
moral
capability,
and
the
personal
circumstances
of
an
offender
can
still
have
a
mitigating
effect.
Sentencing
remains
a
highly
individualistic
process.
Friesen
also
speaks
to
the
range
of
sentences,
directing
that
mid-single
digit
penitentiary
terms
for
offences
of
this
nature
are
normal
and
upper
single
digit
and
double-digit
terms
should
not
be
considered
unusual
nor
are
they
reserved
for
exceptional
circumstances.
Friesen
outlines a
number of significant factors to be taken into account in determining a fit
sentence.
These factors are in
addition to other
sentencing
factors
and
include
the
likelihood
to
reoffend,
the
abuse
of
a
position
of
trust,
the
duration
and
frequency
of
the
incidents,
the
age
of
the
victim
and
the
degree
of
physical
interference.
With
respect
to
the
consideration
of
physical
interference,
courts
are
cautioned
against
minimizing
the
wrongfulness
of
the
offense
or
the
harm
to
the
victim
where
conduct
does
not
involve
penetration,
or
fellatio.
There
is
no
clear
correlation
between
the
type
of
physical
conduct
and
the
harm
to
the
victim.
As
indicated,
the
defense
is
arguing
that
a
conditional
sentence
is
appropriate.
Friesen
makes
it
clear
that
a
sentence
in
the
mid-single
digit
range
for
sexual
offenses
involving
children
is
appropriate
and
that
only
when
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
can
a
court
give
consideration
to
a
conditional
sentence,
or
any
other
sentence
for
that
matter,
outside
the
range
established
by
Friesen.
Friesen
has been considered
in a number of recent decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal, among them:
R. v. Faroughi
2024 ONCA 178 (CanLII)
,
[2024] O.J. No. 1102
;
R. v. M.M. 22 ONCA 441; R. v. B. M.
2023 ONCA 224
; R. v. A.L.
[2025] O.J. No.
86
; and R. v. Pike
2024 ONCA
608
.
I
turn
first
to
the
Ontario
Court
of
Appeal
decision
of
R.
v.
Faroughi
.
The
appellant,
Faroughi,
had
been
convicted
of
two
counts
of
child
luring
and
one
count
of
communicating
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
for
sexual
consideration
the
sexual
services
of
a
person
under
the
age
of
18.
A
sentence
of
seven
months
imprisonment
was
imposed.
It
should
be
noted
that
the
sentencing
decision
under
appeal
was
made
prior
to
the
decision
in
Friesen.
However,
the
principles
from
Faroughi
apply
in
the
post-
Friesen
era
given
that
the
appellate
decision
relies
upon
Friesen
and
its
direction
that
denunciation
and
deterrence
must
be
prioritized
when
sentencing
an
offender
for
sexual
crimes
against
children.
At
paragraph
73,
the
Court
states
as
follows:
"nevertheless,
conditional
sentences
can
be
appropriate
in
circumstances
where
denunciation
and
deterrence
are
the
predominant
sentencing
objectives
as
such
a
sentence
with
punitive
conditions
can
provide
a
significant
amount
of
denunciation
and
deterrence.
And
the
restraint
principle
continues
to
be
applicable
in
circumstances
where,
like
in
this
case,
the
primary
sentencing
principles
are
denunciation
and deterrence.
This Court has
recognized that, in some exceptional circumstances, a conditional sentence may
be fit for an offender convicted of sexual offences against children,”
referring to
R. v. M.M,
and
R. v. B.M.
as examples.
In
the
determination
of
a
fit
sentence,
the
Court
directs
at
paragraph
92:
"This
determination
starts
with
the
recognition
that
the
fundamental
sentencing
principle
is
proportionality,
requiring
sentences
to
be
proportionate
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence
and
the
offender's
degree
of
responsibility:
Friesen,
at
paragraph
30;
R.
v. Morris,
2021 ONCA 680
.
The
restraint principle operates within the boundaries of the proportionality
principle.”
At
paragraph
93,
the
Court
reemphasizes
the
direction
from
Friesen
that
"courts
must
impose
sentences
that
are
commensurate
with
the
gravity
of
sexual
offences
against
children",
and
that
"sentences
for
these
crimes
must
increase,
and
mid-single
digit
penitentiary
terms
should
be
viewed
as
normal."
The
Court
goes
on
to
reemphasize,
at
paragraph
99,
that
post-Friesen,
conditional
sentences
will
rarely
be
appropriate
for
sexual
offenses
against
children.
In considering whether a conditional sentence is
appropriate, the court in
Foroughi
followed a twostep process.
The first required a preliminary
determination
that
a
penitentiary
term
is
not
appropriate
and
that
if
the
statutory
prerequisites
in
section
742.1
are
met
the
court
must
then
determine
if
a
conditional
sentence
is
consistent
with
the
fundamental
purpose
and
principles
of
sentencing.
After
emphasizing
once
again
that
a
conditional
sentence
will
rarely
be
appropriate
for
sexual
offenses
against
children,
the
court
went
on
to
consider,
at
paragraph
105
that
since
the
appellant
was
a
first
time
offender
and
still
a
teenager
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
"the
restraint
principle,
and
the
associated
need
to
meaningfully
consider
the
objective
of
rehabilitation,
also
take
on
an
elevated
importance."
Given
the
analysis
that
the
court
took
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
Friesen
does
not
abrogate
the
principle
of
restraint.
This
is
not
to
say
that
denunciation
and
deterrence
do
not
remain
paramount.
They
do.
But
due
to
the
age
and
absence
of
a
record,
rehabilitation
takes
on
extra
weight,
and
the
principle
of
restraint
needs
to
be
considered.
The
appropriateness
of
a
conditional
sentence
for
sexual
offences
involving
children
was
most
recently
considered
by
the
Ontario
Court
of
appeal
in
R.
v.
A.L.,
involving
convictions
for
trafficking of a person under the age of 18; procuring
a
person
under
the
age
of
18;
advertising
sexual
services;
and
publishing
or
possessing
child
pornography.
After
trial,
a
conditional
sentence
of
18
months
was
imposed.
It
was
the
position
of
the
Crown
on
appeal
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
follow
the
instructions
outlined
in
R.
v.
Friesen
and
elevated
the
personal
circumstances
of
the
appellant
over
the
paramount
principles
of
denunciation
and
deterrence.
The
Court
noted
that
while
a
conditional
sentence
was
exceptional,
there
was
no
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
At
paragraph
17,
the
Court
pointed
out
that
Friesen
reiterated
the
significance
of
the
proportionality
principle
and
the
application
of
mitigating
factors
to
reduce
an
offender's
moral
culpability,
noting
from
Friesen
that
"the
personal
circumstances
of
offenders
can
have
a
mitigating
effect.
For
instance,
offenders
who
suffer
from
mental
disabilities
that
impose
serious
cognitive
limitations
will
likely
have
reduced
moral
culpability."
The court went on to emphasize its decision in
R.
v.
M.M.,
that
conditional
sentences
for
offences
of
this
nature
must
be
limited
to
exceptional
circumstances
that
render
incarceration
inappropriate,
providing
as
an
example
a
medical hardship that could
not be adequately addressed within a Correctional Facility could be an
exceptional circumstance.
There is
not a closed list of the situations that can give rise to exceptional
circumstances.
The
court
adopted
the
comments
of
Chief
Justice
Tulloch
from
R.
v.
Pike
,
explaining
that
the
use
of
the
term
"exceptional
circumstances"
in
M.M.
is
used
as
"shorthand
for
personal
circumstances
and
mitigating
factors
that
are
sufficiently
compelling
to
make
a
conditional
sentence
proportionate,
and
that
this
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
principle
that
"sentencing
must
focus
on
proportionality,
not
pigeonholing
cases
into
ill-defined
exceptional
circumstance
categories."
The
court
also
emphasized
at
paragraph
23
that
nothing
in
Friesen
changes
the
fact
that
sentencing
is
an
individualized
process
that
must
satisfy
the
fundamental
principle
of
proportionality.
I
have
also
considered
the
decision
of
Justice
Harris
of
the
Ontario
Superior
Court
of
Justice
in
R.
v.
Rytel
[2019]
O.J. No.
4856
,
primarily
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
circumstances
of
Mr.
Rytel,
and
J.G.
That
court
was sentencing an accused convicted of
the possession of
a
significant
quantity
of
images
of
child
pornography.
Although
decided
prior
to
Friesen,
Justice
Harris
placed
heavy
reliance
on
the
principles
outlined
in
R.
v.
lnksetter
2018
ONCA
474
,
itself
a
pre-
Friesen
decision,
but
which
outlined
all
of
the
principles
later
outlined
in
Friesen.
The
issue
before
Justice
Harris
was
the
balancing
of
the
seriousness
of
an
offense
which
required
a
lengthy
jail
sentence
consistent
with
the
principles
of
denunciation
and
deterrence,
with
serious
mental
health
problems
faced
by
the
accused.
The
court
found
that
Mr.
Rytel
was
profoundly
impaired
both
cognitively
and
socially.
The
deficits
under
which
he
struggled
were,
to
some
degree,
much
greater
than
those
of
J.G..
Additionally,
Justice
Harris
had
much
more
information
before
him
about
Mr.
Rytel's
mental
health
situation
and
the
impact
of
a
period
of
incarceration
on
that.
Nonetheless,
Justice
Harris'
observations
and
analysis
are
instructive.
I
would
also
note
that
Justice
Harris
found
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
offender's
mental
illnesses
and
his
possession
of
and
access
to
child
pornography.
There is no significant causal link between J.G.'s
mental health deficits and these
offenses.
In
examining
the
impact
of
mental
health
conditions
on
the
nature
and
length
of
sentence
to
be
imposed,
Justice
Harris
said
the
following
at
paragraph
55:
"the
second
method
by
which
a
sentence
can
be
reduced
by
reason
of
mental
illness
is
the
disproportionate
and
potentially
crushing
effect
of
incarceration
on
a
mentally
ill
individual."
Finding
that
Mr.
Rytel
was
so
fragile
that
he
could
not
withstand
a
jail
sentence,
Justice
Harris
observed
that
caution
is
appropriate
when
sentencing
such
an
individual.
He
also
cautioned
that
fragility
is
not
to
be
confused
with
what
he
described
as
an
overly
sensitive
psyche
which
would
not
be
a
factor
in
considering
the
length
and
nature
of
a
period
of
incarceration.
But
the
evidence
before
Justice
Harris
satisfied
him
that
he
was
not
simply
dealing
with
an
overly
sensitive
psyche
but
rather,
a
fragile
individual.
That
is
the
case
here
as
well.
Based
on
his
own
observations
of
the
accused
before
him
as
well
as
comments
from
family
members
and
the
psychiatric
evidence,
Justice
Harris
concluded
as
follows
at
paragraph
64:
"Mr.
Rytel's
vulnerability
could
not
be
more
conspicuous.
Jail
can
be
and
often
is
a
very
difficult and potentially dangerous environment to
navigate.
Mr.
Rytel
cannot
cope
with
being
around
people
and
has
no
social
skills
of
any
kind.
Furthermore,
his
very
unusual
appearance
and
his
impairments
would
make
him
prime
fodder
for
the
cruelty
which
is
a
daily
fact
of
life
in
that
environment."
Having
reached
that
conclusion,
Justice
Harris
found
that
substantial
time
in
jail
would
be
disproportionate
to
the
moral
blameworthiness
of
the
accused
before
him.
The
moral
blameworthiness
of
J.G.
is
far
higher
than
that
of
Mr.
Rytel
particularly
given
Justice
Harris'
finding
of
a
connection
between
his
mental
health
deficits
and
the
commission
of
the
offense.
Nonetheless,
the
observations
of
Justice
Harris
are
as
relevant
in
this
case
as
they
were
in
that
case.
ANALYSIS
In
assessing
the
fitness
of
a
sentence,
a
court
must
also
look
to
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
surrounding
the
offense
and
the
offender.
Paramount
among
the
aggravating
circumstances
here
is
the
age
of
the
victim.
Beyond that, while not in a caregiving role, there was a relationship of trust
to some degree.
J.G. is C.W.'s older brother and was someone that she
looked up to.
The acts themselves
were repetitive, demeaning, and persisted
over
a
period
of
years.
They
all
occurred
in
the
family
home,
the
one
place
where
C.W.
was
entitled
to
feel
safe
and
protected.
There
is
a
high
degree
of
moral
blameworthiness.
J.G.
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
that
what
he
was
doing
was
wrong.
The
mitigating
circumstances
are
but
few.
There
is
the
fact
of
a
guilty
plea.
That
plea
stands
to
some
degree
as
an
expression
of
remorse
but
more
significantly
did
save
C.W.
the
additional
trauma
of
having
to
relive
the
events
by
testifying
in
what
would
likely
have
been
a
lengthy
trial.
J.G.
is
a
first
offender
and
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offences,
was
18.
In
the
period
following
his
arrest
to
this
point,
J.G.
has
done
nothing
by
way
of
counselling.
Had
he
taken
positive
steps
in
that
direction,
that
would
have
been
a
mitigating
circumstance.
While
the
absence
of
any
initiative
on
his
part
to
seek
counselling
is
not
an
aggravating
circumstance
it
is
nonetheless
of
significant
concern.
The
Section
34
Assessment
and
the
pre-sentence
report
identify
J.G. as at a high risk for reoffending
for sexual offences.
The
issue
to
be
addressed
in
considering
all
that
I
have
outlined
in
these
reasons
is
whether
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
that
warrant
the
imposition
of
a
conditional
sentence
rather
than
a
lengthy
period
of
incarceration.
The
Section 34
Assessment
describes
a
person
with
significant
social
deficits
that
arise
from
a
variety
of
mental
illnesses
that
he
has
been
diagnosed
with.
He
is
described
by
family
members
as
being
nonsocial
and
the
history
outlined
in
the
Section 34
Assessment
bears
that
out.
J.G.
could
not
function
in
an
organized
structured
classroom
setting.
Special
accommodation
had
to
be
made
in
order
to
allow
him
to
function
in
a
school
type
setting.
Jails
are
large,
crowded
and
highly
structured
and
regulated
facilities.
They
are,
as
Justice
Harris
pointed
out,
often
violent
and
highly
perilous
for
vulnerable
people.
While
somewhat
speculative,
perhaps
given
the
somewhat
limited
information
before
me
compared
to
what
was
before
Justice
Harris,
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
J.G.
will
not
being
able
to
function
in
any
meaningful
way
in
jail,
essentially
living
isolated
in
his
cell
and
likely
being
targeted
for
physical
abuse.
Suicide
is
a
distinct
possibility.
While
there
are
programs
in
a
custodial
setting
for
offenders
such
as
J.G.,
given
his
limitations,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
he
would
even
participate
in
them
let alone
get
anything
out
of
them.
Notwithstanding
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
in
particular
the
high
degree
of
moral
blameworthiness
of
J.G.,
after
considering
all
of
the
cases
and
applying
the
principles
of
both
Friesen
and
Faroughi
I
believe
that
a
conditional
sentence
is
appropriate.
It
is
consistent
with
the
fundamental
principles
and
purposes
of
sentence
and
will
not
pose
a
danger
to
the
public. Containing
a
condition
as
it
will
requiring
the
participation
in
counselling,
there
is
a
far
greater
likelihood
that
that
counselling
will
be
successful
in
this
setting
largely
as
it
will
be
a
setting
in
which
he
is
far
more
likely
to
participate
in
counselling.
In
addressing
the
issue
of
counselling
generally
and
rehabilitation
in
particular,
I
am
not
giving
greater
weight
to
the
principle
of
rehabilitation.
Friesen,
provides
that
it
remains
a
principle
which
is
given
extra
weight
in
circumstances
such
as
these
with
a
youthful
first
offender.
These reasons to be served in the
community for two years.
The conditional
order will be followed by a period of probation of three years.
For these reasons, then, there will be a conditional
sentence imposed for a period of two years, less one day.
That will be followed by an order of
probation of three years, the maximum probation term allowed.
The terms of the conditional
sentence order as follows:
It is a reporting requirement, to
report in person today to the conditional sentence supervisor and after that as
directed by the supervisor.
The reporting requires throughout
the duration of the conditional sentence order.
You
are
to
cooperate
with
the
supervisor,
signing
any
releases
necessary
to
permit
the
supervisor
to
monitor
compliance,
and
you
must
provide
proof
of
compliance
with
any
condition
of
this
order
to
your
supervisor
on
request.
You are to reside where directed
and approved by the supervisor, so there can be no change of that address
without the consent of the supervisor in advance.
The house arrest condition is in
effect for the full duration of the sentence.
There
are
exceptions,
as
are
typically
in
such
an
order.
Medical
emergencies
involving
yourself
or
any
immediate
member
of
your
family,
going
directly
to,
from
and
being
at
court
attendances,
medical,
legal
or
dental
appointments,
for
going
directly
to
or
from
and
being
at
assessment,
treatment
or
counselling
sessions.
You
will
need
to
confirm
your
schedule
in
advance
with
the
supervisor
setting
out
the
times
for
these
activities
with
the
prior
written
approval
of
the
supervisor,
which
is
to
be
carried
on
you
at
all
times,
for
carrying
out
any
legal
obligations
regarding
compliance
with
this
order.
And
to
acquire
the
necessities
of
life
on
a
date
and
times
as
set
by
the
supervisor
in
writing.
You are not to change your place of
address without obtaining the consent supervisor.
You
are
not
to
permit
any
persons
whatsoever
into
your
residence
except
for
those
approved
in
advance
in
writing
by
the
supervisor
and
you're
to
present
yourself
with
the
doorway
upon
the
request
of
your
supervisor
or
a
peace
officer
for
the
purpose
of
verifying
your
compliance
with home confinement.
GPS provisions will apply.
You are to report to the supervisor for
the purpose of arranging enrollment in the GPS monitoring program.
After
completing
that
intake
process,
you
are
then
to
go
directly
to
your
approved
residence
and
observe
a
term
of
complete
house
arrest
until
the
GPS
unit
is
installed.
There
are
no
exceptions
to
that
term
of
house
arrest.
The GPS monitoring program is in
effect for the entire length of the sentence.
You
will
be
subject
to
the
monitoring
of
that
program
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
protocols
outlined
as
Schedule
A
to
this
conditional
sentence
order,
which
forms
a
part
of
this
conditional
sentence
order,
which
needs
to
be
followed.
You
will
follow
the
instructions
of
the
conditional
sentence
supervisor
or
representatives
with
respect
to
the
installation
of
the
GPS
monitoring
ankle
bracelet
and
any
associated
condition.
You are to have no contact, communication, or
association, directly or indirectly with C.W. or any other person named by your
supervisor to remain away from.
You are not to be within 500 metres
of any known place of residence, education, or employment of C.W. and you are
to remain at least 500 metres away from her person.
You are not to have in your
possession any weapons to defined in the
Criminal Code
.
You are not to possess, consume or
purchase alcohol or other intoxicating substances.
You are not
to possess or consume any unlawful drugs or substances under the
Controlled
Drugs and Substances A
ct.
You
will
have
to
attend
and
actively
participate
in
all
assessments,
counselling
or
rehabilitative
programs
as
directed
by
the
supervisor.
Complete
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
supervisor,
including
but
not
limited
to
psychiatric
or
psychological
issues,
stress
management,
sexual
offending,
life
skills
or
any
other
areas
identified
by
the
supervisor.
You are to sign any release of information forms as
will enable the supervisor to monitor your attendance
and
completion
of
any
assessments,
counselling
or
rehabilitative
programs
as
directed,
providing
proof
of
attendance
and
completion
of
assessments,
counselling
or
rehabilitative
programs
as
directed.
As
a
further
aspect
of
the
non-association,
no
contact,
communication,
association
directly
or
indirectly
with
any
person
under
the
age
of
by
any
means
unless
approved
in
advance
by
the
supervisor.
There may be relatives, Mr. Marley,
that can be sorted out by the supervisor.
K. MARLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour.
THE
COURT:
I
realize
you
were
not
trial
counsel,
were
there
any
other
conditions
that
the
Crown
would
suggest
as
being
appropriate?
I
think
I have
covered
about
all
that
is
part
of
the
forms.
S. CARMODY:
I believe so.
I
believe so for the CSO order, Your Honour.
Thank
you.
THE
COURT:
All
right.
J.G.,
do
you
understand
the
terms
of
that
order
that
I
just
imposed?
You
are
indicating
with
a
nod
up
and
down
you
do.
Failure
to
follow
any
of
those
terms
violates
the
order.
That
would
result
in
your
immediate
arrest
and
detention
in
a
jail
to
determine
whether
you
should
continue
to
serve
the sentence in the community or whether it should
convert
to
a
period
of
time
in
an
incarceration
facility.
There
is
a
presumption
at
law
that
people
who
violate
the
terms
of
a
conditional
sentence
order
should
serve
the
balance
of
the
sentence
in
a
custodial
facility.
That
will
be
followed
by
an
order
of
probation.
The
probation
order
is
in
effect
for
a
period
of
three
years.
It
is
a
reporting
order
of
probation
that
requires
that
you
report
to
a
probation
office
within
two
working
days
of
your
completion
of
the
conditional
sentence
order,
after
that
as
directed
by
the
probation
officer.
You are to reside where directed and approved by the
Probation Office, which means you cannot change that address without the
consent in advance of the probation officer.
You
are
to
have
no
contact,
communication,
association
directly
or
indirectly
with
C.W.
or
any
other
person
named
by
your
probation
officer,
remaining
at
least
500
metres
away
from
any
known
place
of
residence,
education,
employment
of
C.W.,
and
500
metres
away
from
her
person.
You are to have no contact, communication, association
directly or indirectly with any person under the age of 16, except with
approval in advance in writing by your supervisor.
That is contact by any means, which includes electronic means.
You
will
have
to
attend
for
any
counselling
recommended
by
the
probation
officer,
including
all
of
the
counselling
that
I
have
outlined
in
the
conditional
sentence
order,
again
providing
consent
to
release
of
information,
proof
of
attendance.
You are not to have in your
possession any weapons as defined in the
Criminal Code
.
Do
you
understand
all
the
terms
of
the
probation
order?
Again,
with
the
nod
of
the
head,
you
are
indicating
you
do.
Ms.
Carmody,
that
pretty
well
mirrors
the
terms
that
are
contained
in
the
conditional
sentence
order.
Anything
else
the
Crown
will
be
suggesting?
S. CARMODY:
Not for the probation order.
Thank
you, Your Honour.
THE
COURT:
All
right.
Thank
you.
You
indicated
you
understood
the
terms
that
the
probation
order.
It
is
an
offence
under
the
Criminal
Code
to
fail
to
comply
with
any
of
those
terms.
That
would
likely
result
in
further
criminal
proceedings.
DNA
is primary designated. There will be a DNA order. That can be taken today at
the courthouse, am I correct? Thank you.
There
will be a Section 109 order in effect for a period of ten years prohibiting you
from having in your possession any firearms, ammunition, restricted weapons,
prohibited weapons and devices.  Swara order?
S. CARMODY: Yes. The Crown is seeking a 109 order for
life. They’re further seeking a Swara order for 20 years, and a Section 116(1)
order for 20 years. I believe my colleague may have provided some case law as
per the case in
R. v. Brar 2016
Ontario Court of Appeal and the decision
in the Supreme Court of Canada and
R. v. K.R.J. 2016
. The Crown is
proposing the wording for the 116 order, prohibited from attending a public
park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years are
present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre,
school ground, playground or community centre, be within two kilometres of any
dwelling house where C.W. ordinarily resides, not to seek, obtain, or continue
any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or become a
volunteer in the capacity that involves being in a position of trust
or
authority
towards
persons
under
the
age
of
16
years.
Don't
have
any
contact,
including
communication
by
any
means
with
a
person
who
is
under
the
age
of
16
unless
the
offender
does
so
in
the
company
of
another
adult
whom
the
Court
considers
appropriate.
THE COURT:
Any comment, Mr. Marley?
K.
MARLEY:
I
think
I
heard
the
Crown
say
two
kilometres
in
terms
of
a
territorial
restriction
in
relation
to
the
complaint,
and
I
just
wonder
about
in
a
community
this
size,
whether
that
would
preclude
you
from
getting
from
a
lot
of
points
A
to
points
B.
I
would
suggest
you
consider
the
500-metre
radius
that
you
included
in
your
order.
THE COURT:
Ms. Carmody?
S. CARMODY:
I think it's appropriate, given the nature of the offences, and
it's a minor inconvenience, in the Crown’s opinion.
THE COURT:
Given the number and location of public parks, it would be very
easy to be precluded from going to many places if the area were not reduced
significantly.
So I think the 500
meters is appropriate, otherwise the wording suggested by the crown for that
order.
The Swara order in effect for
a period of 20 years.
K. MARLEY:
Yes, Your Honour.
I
would just ask that you waive the victim fine surcharge given his financial
circumstances.
THE COURT:
Yes.
Yes, that is
waived.
I believe that covers all the
ancillary orders.
K. MARLEY:
I believe so, Your Honour.
Yes,
thank you.
S. CARMODY:
Sorry, Your Honour.
You
were imposing the Swara....
THE COURT:
Pardon me?
S. CARMODY:
You're imposing the Swara order as well as the 116(1) order?
THE COURT:
Yes, I have made both.
S. CARMODY:
Thank you.
THE COURT:
Both are appropriate.
The
only concern I had with the 116(1) was the radius.
S. CARMODY:
Okay.
Thank you.
THE COURT:
All right.
K. MARLEY:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.
THE COURT:
You are welcome.
We
will take a break, and I will come back in and sign that when it is ready.
Thank you.
CLERK REGISTRAR:
All rise.
THE COURT:
Oh, the other charges are withdrawn, if they have not already
been.
S. CARMODY:
If that was the understanding, then yes.
THE COURT:
That was my understanding that everything else was to be
withdrawn.
