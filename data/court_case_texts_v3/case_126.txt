Agreed
Statement
of
Facts
[
5
]
The majority of the Crown’s case
went in through an agreed statement of facts. Contained within Exhibit #1 are
the following agreed upon facts:
(1)
On March 8, 2024, Terry Huang
attended at Chit Chats Shipping at 825 Denison Street, Unit #9, in Markham,
Ontario and dropped off two parcels. Both Parcels were addressed to:
Andrew
T
and Terry H 1306 NW 6th St Miami,
FL
33215-4722

Abie
Paul,
an
associate
at
Chit
Chats
Shipping,
inspected
the
parcels
after Terry
Huang
dropped
them
off.
Chit
Chats
Shipping
has
a
policy
to
screen
the
first three
packages
being
shipped
by
new
customers.
Terry
Huang
created
an
account on February 25,
2024, and his client history had one earlier shipped parcel on February 26,
2024.
(3)
On March 11, 2024, Jason Walker,
the district manager of Chit Chats Shipping, reported the packages that Terry
Huang dropped off on March 8, 2024 to the police. PC Ho and PC Patel were
dispatched to Chit Chats Shipping to respond to the call.

At
13:06,
PC
Ho
and
PC
Patel
arrived
at
Chit
Chats
Shipping
and
spoke
to Kohilavani
Thivagaran,
one
of
the
shipping
clerks.
Kohilavani
Thivagaran
provided the officers with the two packages that were dropped
off by Mr. Huang on March 8, 2024. Officers seized the packages and attended at
York Regional Police - 5 District to process the contents of the packages.
(5)
One package contained a VLONE
shirt with “FRIENDS” on it, in orange writing. Tucked inside was a silver
Ziploc baggie that contained white pills and another vacuum sealed bag with
multiple small baggies with substances inside.
(6)
One package contained a black
AMIRI t-shirt. Tucked inside was a silver Ziploc bag containing several
individual baggies inside of it.

The
agreed
statement
of
fact
continues:
(7)
On March 12, 2024, Mr. Huang
attended at Chit Chats Shipping to follow up on the packages he dropped off on
March 8, 2024. A Chit Chats Shipping employee directed Terry Huang to contact
Chit Chats support and US Customs.

On March 29, 2024, DC Hatzes began
drafting a
Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act
search
warrant
for
123
White
Lotus
Circle,
Markham,
Ontario
and the black 2013 BMW X6, Licence Plate:
(Ontario) BVWL056. This is the address on
file
with
Chit
Chats
Shipping
for
Mr.
Huang.
The
warrants
were
approved
on
the
same day.
(9)
On April 3, 2024, police attended
at 123 White Lotus Circle, Markham, Ontario to execute the search warrant and
they made entry at 18:35 hours. Mr. Huang
met
officers,
unlocked
the
door
and
had
a
cellphone
in
his
hand.
DC
Hatzes arrested Mr. Huang and provided
him with his rights to counsel and caution.
(10)
During
a
search
of
Mr.
Huang’s
bedroom
at
123
White
Lotus
Circle,
DC
Meli
located
a
brown
cardboard
box
in
the
closet.
Inside
the
box,
was
a
black
dime
bag with
white
powder,
a
clear
dime
bag
with
powder,
cigarettes,
a
grinder,
a
pipe,
and supplements. Next to the brown
cardboard box, DC Meli located an Ontario Driver’s licence in Terry Huang’s
name.
(11)
DC Meli located various parcels
and stickers with Terry Huang’s name on them in the closet, and a “drug testing
kit” on the closet floor. On the upper shelf of the closet, a “capsule filler
device” was located.
(12)
On
the
upper
shelf
of
the
closet,
DC
Meli
located
a
black
“Supreme”
satchel,
that
contained
various
packaged
substances.
Located
also
were
many
items
which contained
the
name
and
picture
of
Mr.
Huang
on
them.
DC
Hatzes
located
a
digital scale with white residue, a red
supreme box, and metal tools with residue on top of
the
yellow
bin
beside
the
bed.
DC
Hatzes
located
various
substances
inside
the red supreme box.
(13)
A
search
of
another
room
in
the
house
was
conducted
as
well.
DC
Azoulay
located a small baggie with a white substance in a black Dior
satchel that was
on the floor, under the desk. DC Azoulay also located a white
powder substance on the desk with a “T” on it, orange/yellow pills on the desk
in a Ziploc bag, and in a black backpack on the floor, he located a large
number of baggies and empty pill
capsules.
(14)
On a Christmas card contained
within that same room, someone named “Kendrick”
appears
to
have
written:
“Teerrryyy!!
Thx

all
the
hookups

Kevin

[

]
As their sole
viva voce
witness
on the trial the Crown called Det. Kevin Selwood. After
going
through
his
CV,
and
his
testimony
about
his
experience
with
the
York
Regional
Police Service, his education, and his participation in conferences and
continuing education,
on
consent
of
both
parties
I
qualified
Det.
Selwood
to
provide
expert
evidence
in the area of drug subculture, drug pricing, and drug distribution of
ketamine, cocaine and MDMA.
[

In his expert opinion report,
tendered as Exhibit #9, Det. Selwood outlines the quantities of drugs seized
during the investigation:
•
36.13 grams of MDMA in 7 separate
packages (9.81g + 1.9g + 0.52g + 2.21g + 4.79g + 0.07g + 15.08g)

[

]
In
his
examination
in
chief,
and
consistent
with
the
evidence
contained
in
his
expert
opinion
report,
Det.
Selwood
provided
an
overview
of
the
effect
of
each
of
these
drugs
on the
body
and
their
typical
pricing.
He
also
included
evidence
about
the
subculture
of
each of the drugs
involved, the typical “scene” these drugs are used in, and usual individual
doses vs. amounts for the purpose of trafficking.
[
12
]
Det.
Selwood
testified
about
varying
indicia
of
trafficking
with
respect
to
drugs
like cocaine, ketamine and MDMA, as well
as the presence of items that could lead to an inference of trafficking
– cutting agents, multiple cell
phones, large
amounts
of currency.
The
presence
of
packing
materials can
also
lead
to
an
inference
of
trafficking
–
baggies, empty capsules, weigh scales.
[
13
]
At
the
conclusion
of
his
examination-in-chief,
Det.
Selwood
stated:
“In my
experience, the sheer volume of these substances on their own, in my
experience, is more than a, even a heavy sustained user would have in their
possession. The presence of the other indicia of, packaging, currency, multiple
phones, scale, that enhances that opinion because those are commonly found
with, with someone who is trafficking these substances versus someone who's
using them. I haven't seen these amounts, in my experience, for personal use.
Also,
the
presence
of
multiple
substances
allows
for
increase
in
profit
margin.
If,
in fact, the, the
individual was using one of these substances, it allows them to support their
habit.
[
14
]
With respect to indicia of
trafficking, Det. Selwood agreed in cross-examination that there is nothing
rather exceptional about having $395 in cash in one’s possession (like
Mr.
Huang
did).
Similarly
to
his
knowledge
there
were
no
known
cutting
agents
found during the search.
[
15
]
Det.
Selwood
testified
that
in
his
experience
he
has
never
come
across
a
personal user of any of
these drugs “buy in bulk” to avoid security risks of continually buying from a
sketchy or unsafe drug dealer. He allowed for the possibility that it could
happen.
Evidence
of
Terry
Huang
[
16
]
Mr. Huang testified that he is 26
years old, and currently lives in Markham. He graduated
high
school,
and
then
went
to
the
University
of
Waterloo
and
got
his
bachelor’s
degree in science and business. Following graduation, he went to work for
Deloitte, but now works for Salesforce in business development.
[
17
]
Mr. Huang and his friends (a large
group of about 15 friends) are very much into the electronic dance music (EDM)
scene. Their hobby is going to raves, attending concerts and music festivals.
[
18
]
Mr. Huang testified that they go
to festivals or concerts quite often. On average, according
to
Mr.
Huang,
they
would
go
to
10
or
so
festivals
a
year,
and
maybe
somewhere between 15 to 20 or more
individual concerts per year.
[
19
]
Throughout
his
testimony,
Mr.
Huang
was
not
shy
in
talking
about
his
involvement with
various
“party
drugs”.
Mr.
Huang
testified
that
“(a)ll
of
the
substances
that
were
found in my house would have been consumed
at these events”.
[
20
]
Mr. Huang admitted that he attended at
the Chit Chats Shipping in Markham to drop the packages off. He testified that
the destination was an Airbnb in Miami that he and
his
friends
were
going
to
stay
at
for
the
Ultra
Music
Festival
in
Miami
from
March
22
nd
to March 24
th
, 2024. Even though the package destined for Miami
never made it, Mr. Huang and his friends
still
went to the festival in Miami. At one point Mr. Huang reached out to the
shipping company and was told that it was still in transit.
[
21
]
Mr.
Huang
then
testified
as
to
the
following:
Q. All right.
So, Terry, the drugs that were found in that package that was intercepted at
Chit Chats, is there a relationship between those substances and what was found
at your house?
A. Yes. The
package from Chit Chats was, or, sorry. The substances from the package from
Chit Chats were all, all came from the substances that were found at my house.
[
22
]
Mr. Huang testified that the
substances found at his house, and by extension the ones
also
that
were
found
in
the
Chit
Chats
packages
were
all
purchased
in
one
big
order,
or all at once to be more specific. Mr. Huang testified that he purchased a
quantity of MDMA, ketamine, LSD and cocaine, as well as several pressed pills
of MDMA.
[
23
]
I will admit that when Mr. Huang
testified so freely and openly about purchasing large quantities of various
drugs, I was a little taken aback. I interrupted Mr. Huang’s
examination-in-chief to ask Mr. Rechtshaffen to clarify the defence position.
Mr. Huang was clearly testifying that he was in possession of the drugs –
simple possession only according to him.
[
24
]
With reference to various mandates
(of which I know nothing) or directions to federal prosecutors with respect to
the prosecution of offences of simple possession, counsel for Mr. Huang stated:
“Obviously, I'm not trying to put my friend in an awkward position, but
legally, on the strict interpretation of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act
, my client will be admitting that he was in possession of these drugs.
Simple
possession.”
[
25
]
Mr.
Huang
testified
that
the
MDMA
he
received
was
in
rock
form
as
well
as
pressed
pills, and the ketamine that he received was in two forms also – S-type and
R-type. The S-type looks like a rock, and the R-type looks like crystalline
shards.
[
26
]
Mr. Huang testified that he and
his main group of friends that he attends the festivals with – 15 of them – were
all party to this purchase.
[
27
]
This purchase all came about when
Mr. Huang and his friends were at the VELD music festival in Toronto, and they
were testing out a new supply of drugs. He and his friends thought that it was
a good supply, so they discussed how they should pick up a large quantity so
that they had a supply for the upcoming festival season.
[
28
]
Factors
in
favour
of
their
decision
to
buy
in
bulk
were
that
they
liked
the
product,
it was safe (given the ongoing fentanyl
crisis) and the supplier maintained a safe supply, the
availability
of
the
dealer,
and
it
was
simply
economical
to
buy
in
bulk.
This
latter
point is consistent with the testimony of
Det. Selwood.
[
29
]
Despite the fact that all
15 of
his
friends were
in on the decision to
make this
bulk purchase, Mr. Huang
went by himself to make the purchase.
[
30
]
The
original
order
was
2
ounces
of
cocaine, 1.5 ounces
of
MDMA (moonrock
and champagne),
1
ounce
of
ketamine,
250
single
doses
of
LSD,
and
then
75
pressed
MDMA pills. The total
cost
was
about
$7000. Everyone contributed roughly
the
same amount
of money ($500 each).
Almost everyone paid Mr. Huang in advance.
[
31
]
The
quantity
contained
within
the
bulk
order
as
outlined
by
Mr.
Huang
is
consistent with the
amounts
seized as
referenced in Det.
Selwood’s
report.
The
amount
seized
is
a
little less than the bulk order, but this makes sense given the passage of
time, and the testimony of Mr. Huang.
[
32
]
Mr. Huang kept
all the
drugs at his
house. He
recognized that
he
assumed all the
risk, and that he did so because his parents aren’t as “snoopy” as his friends’
parents, and his parents would not go through his belongings and his room. Mr.
Huang admitted that assuming all the risk, keeping the drugs at his house, and using
his real name and real information to ship the drugs to Miami was not a wise
decision.
[
33
]
The initial discussion with his
friends about the purchase happened at the VELD music festival in early August
2023. A week or so later they further discussed what they wanted
to
buy
and
put
together
a
rough
estimate
of
the
quantities.
The
bulk
purchase
was supposed to take them through to at
least the end of the festival season in 2024. The actual bulk purchase was made
in late August 2023.
[
34
]
As part of his
examination-in-chief, Mr. Huang put in a number of charts and spreadsheets into
evidence. It is clear that he and his friends are a close knit, and very
organized group. They keep track of expenses, ticket sales, hotel bookings, and
even grocery lists on various shared spreadsheets. They love going to EDM
festivals and meticulously keep track of their expenses and costs.
[
35
]
Mr.
Huang
testified
that
the
one
or
two
people
who
did
not
pay
their
$500
share
for
the bulk purchase were prohibited from accessing the drugs until they paid. It
was Mr. Huang who asserted this control – he wanted to make it fair for
everyone.
[
36
]
With
respect
to
how
people
would
access
the
drugs,
and
the
“ownership”
of
these
drugs, Mr. Huang testified to the following in his examination-in-chief:
D.
RECHTSHAFFEN:
Q.
And,
I
guess
that
brings
me
to
my
next
point.
In
terms
of anyone who had joint ownership in these
drugs, you described keeping them in your house
and
you
said
that
part of
the
issue
was
that
people
lived
at
home,
and they might have nosy parents. But if
someone wanted to access their share of these drugs, was there, like, did you
exercise control over them over and above their ability to access them?
A. No. Oh.
Sorry. No. Not at all. Since they
had
their own equal ownership, and it was simply being stored at my house, if they
wanted to access them at any time, they were more than welcome to.
Q. Okay. Did
you ever run into any kind of issues with that, any conflict over that between
you and any of the other parties?
A.
No.
I
would
say
that
me
and
my
friend
group
are
very
close
and
we're
very
tight-
knit, and we have a good level of trust between all of us that, you know,
nobody
would
ever
try
to
cheat
the
system
or,
you
know,
like
take
more
than
they're
allowed
to share.
Q.
Okay.
And,
how
did
you
keep
track
of
what
was
being
used
by
everyone?
A. Primarily,
there was a, I guess there was a sheet in the house that, you know, like if you
took something, you would have marked down, for example, if I came and I
grabbed like two grams of cocaine or whatever, I would say, I would mark down
on the paper two grams of coke.
…
Q.
So,
these
bags,
these
are
all
taken
from
the
Chit
Chats
package?
A.
Correct.
Q.
What
do
the
names
on
these
packages
correspond
to?
A.
These
correspond
to
my
friends
that
also
went
to
Ultra
Music
Festival
with
me.
Q.
Okay. And, so
do
all
of these, is
each
one
bag
assigned
to
a
particular
person, or how does this work?
A.
For
the
most
part,
all
the
bags
are
assigned
to
a
particular
person.
There
is
two extra bags, I believe. One of them
should say extra on it, and the other one has my name on it. Those are
basically just because at these festivals, it's very unpredictable how much
substances you're planning to do. And, the way that we thought about it was
that it was always better to have too much rather than too
little.
Q.
Okay.
And,
so,
for
example,
there's
one
bag
here
that's
just
labelled
K.
Can
you tell us about that bag?
A.
Yes.
So,
again,
with
these
kinds
of
powders,
especially
since
we're
hanging
out all together as a group, it doesn't
really make much sense to split it into like, you know, like five different
bags of like 0.3 grams or anything. Since we're all pretty much together the
whole time, it makes sense to just keep it in kind of like one communal
bag. Since nobody really takes more than
another person, or we have like a good level of trust that nobody would try to,
it's, it’s easier just to have like one
communal
bag
and
if
you
want
one,
you
know,
just
come
over,
ask
for
a
bump.
…
Q. Okay. And,
so if we see a particular person's name on a bag of powder, for example,
Bobby...
A.
Correct.
Q.
...or Safe
or
whatever...
A.
Mm-
hmm.
Q. ...does that
mean that that person just consumes that for themselves or is it possible that
there's some other kind of usage?
A. Yeah. So,
the reason
for that is because those
people had specific sets or like portions of days
that, where
they would
not be
with the
group. For example, if the
majority of
us wanted to see one DJ, but, you know, like I guess Bobby, for example,
said,
hey,
I'm
going
to
go
see
this
guy
for
a
closing
instead,
can
you,
you know, make sure I have my own bag for that
festival, or, sorry, that DJ.
THE
COURT:
Sorry.
Go
back
to
that
picture
if
you
don't
mind.
D.
RECHTSHAFFEN:
Sure.
THE
COURT:
Who
did
the
divvying
up
of
substances
into
those
bags? THE WITNESS: That would have been
me.
THE
COURT:
Who
wrote
the
names
on
the
bags?
THE WITNESS: That would have also been me. THE COURT: Okay. Thanks.
D.
RECHTSHAFFEN: Q. Just on that point though, is there a limitation on how much
anyone could have asked for up to their share of, you know, one 15th of
whatever the total was?
A.
Um....
Q.
Like
did
you
decide?
Were
you
the....
A. No,
no, no. Everyone
told me
exactly what
they wanted. Again,
this is like their own portion. All I
really did was, because it was already at my house, I just put it into bags for
them.
[
37
]
Mr.
Huang
was
the
one
who,
because
it
was
stored
at
his
house,
put
the
bulk
order into
individual
baggies
or
capsules,
wrote
names
on
the
bags,
and
prepared
the
individual amounts for his
friends.
[
38
]
Mr. Huang was taken through the
chart contained within the agreed statement of facts
and
testified
–
consistent
with
his
earlier
position
–
that
all
the
drugs
seized
from
his house
came
from
the
group
buy.
Some
of
the
drugs
came
in
various
forms
-rock,
powder, pills. When taken to a
picture of some MDMA in rock form, I had
the following exchange with Mr. Huang:
THE
COURT:
Can
I
ask
one
question
since
you're
on
that
picture?
D.
RECHTSHAFFEN:
Sure.
THE
COURT:
When
you
bought
it... THE WITNESS: Yes.
THE
COURT:
...like
from
the,
when
you
bought
kind
of
the
bulk
purchase... THE WITNESS: Yes.
THE
COURT:
...some
of
it
came
to
you
like
that,
like
kind
of
in
a
rock.
Right?
THE
WITNESS:
Primarily,
primarily
a
rock.
Yes.
THE
COURT:
But
in
order
to
get
it
into
the
capsules,
if
somebody
wanted
capsules...
THE
WITNESS:
Correct.
THE
COURT:
...you
got
to
grind
it. THE WITNESS: Correct.
THE
COURT:
Or
you
got
to
shave
it
or
put
it
through
a
sieve
or
something.
Correct? THE WITNESS: Correct.
THE
COURT:
Who
did
that?
THE
WITNESS: That would have also been me,
simply due to
the
fact
that
it was at my house and I didn't mind helping my friends, I guess.
[
39
]
Mr. Huang testified throughout his
examination in chief that he was the one who manipulated the bulk product into
smaller portions for him and his friends – either by dividing it up into
smaller baggies or putting the broken-down powder into gel capsules.
[
40
]
None
of
the
drugs
from
this
bulk
purchase
were
ever
intended
to
be
sold
to
anyone either inside or outside the friend
group.
[
41
]
If ever
there
was
a communal
bag,
presumably
used
by
all
the
friend
group
at
the
festival, or leftover drugs from a rave or festival, Mr. Huang would store that
bag at his house with the remainder of the bulk order.
[
42
]
In cross-examination Mr. Huang reiterated
that the reason the drugs were stored at
his
place
was
because his
parents
would
not
snoop
through
his
room. He
lived
at
123
White Lotus Circle
with his mother, father and his sister.
[
43
]
Again, with respect to accessing
the drugs, Mr. Huang testified to the following in
cross-examination:
Q. … And you
also mentioned that your friends, there was never an issue with them having
access to that communal drugs?
A.
Correct.
Q. So,
practically, how do they get there? Do they just walk in the front door, upstairs
to your room, and grab drugs?
A.
No.
They
would
let
me
know,
say,
hey,
I
have
so-and-so
coming
up,
can
I
grab, you
know,
like,
some
“M?”
And
I
would
say,
sure.
Like,
I’m
home
between
so-and- so. Just let me know when you’re here.
Q.
And
they’d
come
to
your
house?
A. Yes.
Yeah.
Q. And,
before they get there, you’d have everything kind of packaged out for
them?
A. Not
always. Depending if, depending what I was doing at the time. Sometimes if I
was, if I had time or if I was feeling nice I could but they would also do it
themselves sometimes.
Q. And what
about the pills? They would do the pills themselves too, like, the capsules, I
mean?
A.
Sometimes.
Yes.
It
is
time
consuming
and
sometimes
I
just,
yeah.
Q.
How
would
they
get
the
drugs
into
the
capsules?
Did
they
know
where
the...
A. Yes.
They....
Q
pill
machine
was?
A. Yes. Yes.
They knew, yes, they knew about the pill machine and, yes,
and the
spoons.
…
Q.
And
so,
did
your
friends
know
where
you
were
keeping
the
drugs
in
your
house?
A. Some
of
them
knew,
not all
of
them. Sometimes
like
if, sometimes
I would
just, if I knew
they
were coming over I would just take
it out and, like, put it on, like, on my
table or whatever, like, the box I mean.
[
44
]
When it was put to Mr. Huang in
cross-examination that because of his testing of the supply, and his dividing
up of the bulk order, he is essentially a “drug dealer”, Mr. Huang said the
following:
Q. And
so, while you
have your day
job,
I’ll suggest that you
also
have
a
side
gig, that sometimes you sell some drugs to make a bit of extra money?
A.
No.
I
would
say
that
I
don’t.
Again,
I
don’t
really
have
any
expenses.
While
I
am, you know,
maybe a bit reckless, spending on random things, like, the
drugs have never been about the money. It’s always been about making sure that
me and friends are able to have a good time, stay safe, you know, and, you
know, really live life to the fullest. It’s never really, it’s never been about
the money.
Q.
Making
sure
that
you
and
your
friends
have
a
good
time?
Making
sure
that
they have access to a safe drug supply?
A.
Correct.
That
we
stay
safe.
Analysis
[
45
]
There is one
overriding issue in this,
and in
all criminal trials that come
before
the Court – has the Crown proven the guilt of Mr. Huang beyond a reasonable
doubt? This burden of proof always rests with the Crown. The burden of proof
must be met with respect to each of the offence's essential elements, and this
burden is a heavy one. A reasonable
doubt
must
be
a
doubt
based
on
reason
and
common
sense.
It
is
a
doubt
that logically
arises
from
the
evidence,
or
the
absence
of
evidence.
See:
R.
v.
Lifchus
,
[1997]
S.C.J.
No.
77.
[
46
]
In
order
to
determine
this
issue,
I
must
keep
a number
of
things
in
mind:
(1)
Mr. Huang began this trial with
the presumption of innocence. That presumption
remains
with
him
throughout
the
trial
and
is
only
overcome
if
there
is admissible and properly used evidence
that satisfies me beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt.
(2)
Reasonable doubt is not something
that is imaginary or frivolous, nor is it based
on
sympathy
for
or
prejudice
against
any
of
the
parties.
It
must
be
something
that logically arises from the evidence, or lack thereof. If I am only
satisfied that Mr. Huang is probably guilty, I must acquit him of these
charges.
[
47
]
Mr. Huang testified. When an
accused person testifies at their trial, the Supreme Court of Canada in
R.
v. W.(D.)
,
1991 CanLII 93 (SCC)
,
[1991] S.C.J. No. 26
tells me that first, if I believe the
evidence
of Mr.
Huang, obviously
I
must
acquit him
of the
offences
charged.
Second,
if
I do not believe the testimony of Mr.
Huang but I am left in reasonable doubt by it, I must acquit him. Third, even
if I am not left in doubt by the evidence of Mr. Huang, I must ask myself
whether, based on the evidence which I do accept, I am convinced beyond a
reasonable
doubt
by
that
evidence
of
the
guilt
of
Mr.
Huang.
If
I
am
convinced
of
his
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then I
must convict.
[
48
]
I
must
also
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
Crown
to
prove
anything to
an
absolute
certainty,
nor
is
the
Crown
required
to
do
so
–
this
would
be
an
impossibly high standard. However, it is
trite law that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
falls
much
closer
to
absolute
certainty
than
to
probable
guilt.
It
is
not
enough
for
me to believe that Mr.
Huang is likely or probably guilty.
[
49
]
Throughout
the
course
of
his
testimony
Mr.
Huang
frankly
testified
about
the
initial
purchase of the drugs
from the
“trusted” drug dealer. Mr. Huang testified that as a result of his family
circumstance – i.e. that he has a degree of autonomy over the contents of his
bedroom within his home and his parents did not search his room or go through
his belongings – he was the one that held on to all the drugs for his friends.
[
50
]
At one point during his
examination-in-chief, after a question from me, it became apparent
that
Mr.
Huang
was
testifying
in
such
a
manner
that
amounted
to
an
admission of at least simple possession.
Mr. Huang fully admitted that he bought these drugs from the dealer, he held
them in his room, and he took the drugs to the Chit Chats store.
[
51
]
There
is
no
question,
and
I
have
no
difficulty
finding
as
fact
on
the
evidence
before the
court
–
inclusive
of
his
own
testimony
– that
Mr.
Huang
was
in
possession
of
cocaine, LSD,
MDMA and ketamine. The next issue is what if any other purpose Mr. Huang was in
possession of those drugs for.
Overview
of
the
Law
Exporting
[
52
]
At
the
outset,
I
note
that
during
submissions
counsel
for
Mr.
Huang
took
issue
with the fact that Mr. Huang was formally
arraigned on count #8 and count #10 relating to section 6(3)(a) of the
CDSA
–
this is the punishment section of the exporting offence. Essentially Mr. Rechtshaffen
submits that Mr. Huang was arraigned under the wrong
section.
[
53
]
I disagree. Arraigning an accused
person under the punishment section of an offence
is
routinely
done
and
happens
all
the
time.
This
does
not
render
for
some
reason the
charge
or
the
arraignment
a
nullity.
Mr.
Huang
was
in
no
way
prejudiced,
nor
is
he
left
at a disadvantage, or with some confusion, as to the case against him following
his arraignment under the punishment section.
[
54
]
In
fact,
the
first
words
of
section
6(3)(a)
are
“if
the
subject
matter
of
the
offence
…”, referencing of course the offence in
section 6(1). I reject completely the notion that by virtue of his arraignment
under the punishment section there is any kind or error.
[
55
]
Section
6(1)
of
the
Controlled
Drugs
and
Substances
Act
reads
as
follows:
Importing
and
exporting
6(1) Except as
authorized under the regulations, no person shall import into Canada or
export
from
Canada a
substance
included in
Schedule
I,
II,
III,
IV,
V
or
VI.
[
56
]
Neither the term “importing” nor
“exporting” is defined within the
CDSA
. Courts have routinely given a
plain meaning to these terms, meaning simply to cause to bring into, or cause
to be sent out of the country.
See:
R. v. Bell
,
1983 CanLII 166 (SCC)
,
[1983] S.C.J. No.
83
.
[
57
]
Much of the jurisprudence deals
with the offence of importing. This is likely so because when a substance is
imported, the importing country is the one that deals with the prosecution of
that offence. Conversely, when the offence is exporting (i.e. causing the substance
to leave the country) the country from which the substance is exported does not
have much interaction once the substance has left the country.
[
58
]
Much of the analysis with respect
to the
actus reus
of exporting offences can be taken from the caselaw
dealing with importing offences.
[
59
]
It is often important for accused
persons, when charged with a criminal offence, and
when
defining
the
case
to
be
met,
for
individuals
to
know
when
a
particular
offence
starts
and ends. Put another way, is the particular offence a continuing offence, or
is it complete upon certain action?
[
60
]
The best example of this is of
course the offence of kidnapping. The initial confinement
of
an
individual,
coupled
with
further
detention,
potential
transportation
of
the victim, and
completion when a victim is released is an example of an offence that is
characterized as a continuing offence.
See
R. v. Vu
,
2012 SCC 40 (CanLII)
,
[2012]
S.C.J. No. 40
at paragraph
6
: “Therefore, while the crime of kidnapping may be
complete in law when the victim is initially apprehended and moved, the crime
will not be complete in fact until the victim is
freed.”
[
61
]
The same “continuing offence”
analysis holds true for importing and exporting offences.
The
Ontario
Court
of
Appeal
delt
with
this
issue
in
R.
v.
Foster
,
[2018]
O.J.
No.
488.
Justice
Watt
cites
R.
v. Bell
as
follows
at paragraph
64
and
65:
[64]
The
majority
rejected
the
submission
that
importing
was
a
continuing
offence. McIntyre J. expressed his conclusion in this way:
It is
apparent, in my view, that importing a narcotic cannot be a continuing offence.
I do not
find it necessary
to
make
extensive
reference
to dictionaries in order
to define the word "import". In my view, since the
Narcotic Control Act
does
not
give
a
special
definition
of
the
word,
its
ordinary
meaning
should apply
and
that
ordinary
meaning
is
simply
to
bring
into
the
country
or
to
cause to be brought into the country.
With the utmost respect for judges who have taken
a
different
view,
I
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
characterization
of
importing a
narcotic as a continuing offence is misconceived. The offence is complete when
the
goods
enter
the
country.
Thereafter
the
possessor
or
owner
may
be
guilty of other offences, such as possession, possession for the purpose of
trafficking, or even trafficking itself, but the offence of importing has been
completed
and
the
importer
in
keeping
or
disposing
of
the
drug
has
embarked on a new criminal venture.

Later,
McIntyre

added:
The
Narcotic
Control
Act
forbids
the
importation
of
narcotics
into
Canada.
The offence of importation may be
committed anywhere in Canada and one offence
may
occur
in
whole
or
in
part
at
more
than
one
location
in
Canada.
As in the case of the honest merchant, the
drug importer may from one part of Canada make all the arrangements and do all
the acts necessary to bring about
the
importation
of
narcotics
at
another
point.
In
so
doing,
it
may
be
said he has committed an offence which has
occurred at two places, or commenced in one
jurisdiction and completed in another. Either
the
courts
of the jurisdiction where the goods
entered the country or those of the province where the acts or arrangement
leading to the importation occurred will have jurisdiction to deal with the
case: see

Still
with
reference
to
the
offence
of
importing,
Justice
Zarnett
of
the
Ontario
Court of Appeal in
R. v. Dhatt
,
[2023] O.J. No. 4740
states the following at paragraphs 12 through 14:
[12]
The
appellant
also
argues
that
the
conviction
for
importing
was
unreasonable
because the cocaine did not clear customs and was never released from the
control
of
the
authorities.
He
submits
that
the
decision
of
a
five-judge
panel
of
this
court
in
R.
v.

(3d)

No.
113
stands
for
the
proposition that
the
offence
of
importing
is not complete, and therefore has not
been committed, until these events occur.
[13]
I do not interpret
Okojie
as compelling the far-reaching
conclusion that a person, like the appellant, who intends to import cocaine and
physically brings it with them into Canada does not commit the offence of
importing if the person is caught by customs authorities having cocaine at the
point of entry into Canada, and is thereupon arrested, and the drugs are
seized.
[14]
First,
such
a
conclusion
is
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
in
which
this
court
has affirmed convictions for importing where drugs were detected by customs
authorities at the accused's point of entry into Canada in a suitcase the
accused was
travelling
with,
or
on
their
person,
the
drugs
were
seized
and
the
accused
was thereupon arrested: see for example

]
If the offence of importing is
complete when the goods enter the country, then it stands to reason, and I have
no difficulty in so finding, that the offence of exporting is complete when the
goods leave the country.
[
64
]
Mr. Huang knowingly put the drugs
in the packages, and knowingly took them to the
Chit
Chats
Shipping
company
in
order
to
have
the
drugs
sent
to
Miami
so
that
he
and
his friends could use them at their Airbnb and while attending a music festival
in Miami.
[
65
]
Pursuant to their internal policy,
Chit Chats Shipping search every package sent by a new customer until that
customer has shipped three packages with them. This was Mr. Huang’s
second shipment. His packages
were searched, and the drugs
were found. Mr.
Huang’s
packages
never
left
the
country.
They
stayed
in
Canada
and
made
their
way
into the possession of the police.
[
66
]
Given that the goods never left
the country, the
actus reus
of the offence of exporting is
not complete. Mr. Huang’s
attendance at and the dropping off the
packages at Chit Chats Shipping is not enough to complete the offence. Like the
offence of importing,
the
drugs
needed
to
have
left
the
country
for
the
offence
to
be
complete.

as

(2)
Except as authorized under the regulations, no person shall
possess a substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, V or VI for the

[
68
]
Again,
as
Mr.
Huang
was
arraigned
on
the
punishment
section
with
respect
to
this offence, counsel made
the argument that Mr. Huang was arraigned under the wrong section
and
the
charges
ought
to
be
dismissed.
Based
on
the
above
analysis, I
disagree with
counsel
and
reject
the
argument.
There
is
nothing
wrong
with
arraigning
an
individual on the
punishment section of the charge, especially when on plain reading – like this
section – the offence is referenced in that punishment section.
[

Section 2 of the CDSA incorporated
the definition of possession found in
section 4(3)
of the
Criminal Code of
Canada
which reads as follows:
Possession
(3)
For
the
purposes
of
this
Act,
(a)
a person has anything in possession when he has it in his
personal possession or knowingly
(i)

Knowledge
of
a
drug
can

inferred

Justice
Baltman
of
the
Ontario
Superior
Court
of
Justice
in
R.
v.
Dufort
,
[2024]
O.J.
No.
1659
made
the
following
comment:
[24]
Where
an
accused
possesses
a
controlled
substance
with
a
significant
value, as is the case here, a trier of
fact may infer both knowledge of the nature of the substance
and
knowledge
of
the
substance
itself.
These
inferences
"may
be
available from
the objective improbability that such a valuable quantity of drugs would be
entrusted to anyone who did not know the nature of the contents in the means of
transport": Burnett, at para. 64;
R. v. Bains
,
2015 ONCA 677
, at
para.
157
, leave to appeal refused, [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 478.
[
73
]
Fortunately, here, no such
inference needs resorting to for the purposes of knowledge
of
the
drugs
found
in
relation
to
Mr.
Huang.
There
is
direct
evidence
from
Mr. Huang that he
purchased the drugs along with a number of friends of his, and it was his role
within the friend group to keep possession of the drugs so that they would
avoid detection by any of his friends’ parents.
[
74
]
For the Crown to prove the offence
in section 6(2) of the
CDSA
, the Crown must first prove possession.
Given the manner in which Mr. Huang testified, and the admissions
made
by
both
he
and
his
counsel,
there
is
no
question
that
Mr.
Huang
was
in possession
of
these
drugs.
In
his
possession
he
exercised
both
knowledge
of
the
drugs, and control over the drugs.
[
75
]
Mr. Huang testified that he was
the one who conducted the initial bulk purchase because he was the one who had
contact with the drug dealer. Mr. Huang was the one that kept the drugs at his
house because his parents respected his privacy and did not “snoop” through his
belongings. Mr. Huang was the one who at times divided the bulk purchase up
into smaller amounts for his friends, and even wrote their names on the baggies
for them. Mr. Huang at times created capsules for his friends. Mr. Huang would
at
times
get
smaller
portions
of
the
bulk
purchase
ready
for
his
friends
to
come
pick
up
at his house when they wanted a portion of
the supply.
[
76
]
The
agreed
statement
of
fact,
the
video
evidence,
and
Mr.
Huang’s
own
testimony prove that he
was the one that packaged up the drugs into the shipping packages and took
them
to
Chit
Chats
Shipping
so
that
they
could
be
mailed
to
the
Airbnb
in
Miami.
Mr.
Huang used his own name on the account with the shipping company. Mr. Huang
used his name on the address label.
[
77
]
I have no difficulty finding that
for the offences in counts #11 and #13, as well as the offences in counts #1,
#2, #5 and #6 the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Huang was
in possession of the drugs listed in those counts.
[
78
]
The law
with respect to the
offence
of
exporting
is
outlined
above
and is
relatively straightforward. At this
stage, having proven possession, the Crown must prove that Mr. Huang’s
possession of the drugs was for the purpose of exporting.
[
79
]
There is no question that when Mr.
Huang packaged the drugs (inclusive of LSD and MDMA in a quantity less than one
kilogram), put them in a shipping package, went to the Chit Chats
Shipping company, put his
name and
the
Miami
Airbnb address
on
the package, and
dropped the package off at Chit Chats Shipping, his intent was to export the
drugs to Miami.
[
80
]
Mr
Huang
in
fact
testified
that
he
attempted
to
send
the
drugs
to
Miami
so
that
they could be consumed at a Miami music
festival. His intent and purpose was clear.
[
81
]
There
does
not
need
to
be
the
completed
act
of
exporting
in
order
for this
offence to be proven. The
simple question to be asked – which reflects both the
actus reus
and the
mens rea
of this offence – is when Mr. Huang was in possession of those
drugs, in that
package,
that
he
dropped
off
at
Chit
Chats
Shipping,
did
he
intend
for
those
drugs
to
be sent (or exported) to
Miami? It can only be answered in the affirmative.
Possession
for
the
Purpose
of
Trafficking
[
82
]
Section
5(2)
of
the
Controlled
Drugs
and
Substances
Act
reads
as
follows:
Possession
for
purpose
of

(2)
No
person
shall,
for
the
purpose
of
trafficking,
possess
a
substance
included
in Schedule I, II, III, IV or V.
[
83
]
Similar to the offence of
possession for the purpose of exporting, the Crown, in order to prove
possession for the purpose of trafficking must first prove possession. Based
o
the
analysis
above,
and
Mr.
Huang’s
own
testimony
possession
is
clearly
made
out.
[
84
]
The
Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act
defines “traffic” in section 2(1) as
follows:
traffic
means,
in
respect
of
a
substance
included
in
any
of
Schedules
I
to
V,
(a)
to
sell,
administer,
give,
transfer,
transport,
send
or
deliver
the
substance,
(b)
to
sell
an
authorization
to
obtain
the
substance,
or
(c)
to
offer
to
do
anything
mentioned
in
paragraph
(a)
or
(b), otherwise than under the authority of
the regulations.
(trafic)
[
85
]
Simply
put, trafficking
means
to sell, administer, give, transfer,
transport, send, or deliver
the
substance.
As
well,
an
offer
to
do
any
of
these
things
also
constitutes
trafficking under the CDSA.
[
86
]
To prove the offence of possession
for the purpose of trafficking the Crown must prove both elements of the
offence beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Mr. Huang was in
possession
of
the
drugs,
and
(2)
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
drugs
for
the
purpose
of trafficking.
[
87
]
While I have outlined above how
possession was proven by the Crown, counsel for
Mr
Huang
raised
the
issue
of
joint
possession
and
joint
ownership
of
the
drugs
as
if
it
were a defence to the charge as alleged. The argument distilled down is that
given that Mr. Huang’s other friends all had an equal ownership interest in the
drugs, Mr. Huang cannot have trafficked the drugs to someone who had an
ownership interest in those
drugs.
[
88
]
I
disagree
with
this
argument.
[
89
]
In
support
of
their
position,
counsel
relied
on
R.
v.
Haddock
,
[2014]
O.J.
No.
6625
a
decision
of
Bigelow
J.
of
the
Ontario
Court
of
Justice.
This
case
dealt
primarily
with
the
joint production of marijuana by three individuals, an endeavour which evolved
over several seasons for Mr. Haddock. While this case is easily distinguishable
on its facts – primarily that all individuals involved had the same level of
activity in the production and cultivation of the plants, the following
comments at paragraph 41 and 42:
[41]
In
my
view,
the
admissions
with
respect
to
trafficking
referred
to
above
do
not
change
the
purpose
for
which
the
plants
were
grown.
The
defence
evidence,
which I am unable to
reject,
is
that the
purpose
of
the grow op was
to
provide
marijuana for the consumption of the joint
owners of the plants. The type of trafficking admitted was clearly only
incidental to the production, and not the reason that it was being produced.
[42]
In
R
v
Gardiner
,
[1987]
O.J.
No.
411
our
Court
of
Appeal
considered
the
issue of joint
ownership of marijuana and found, as stated in the headnote: "Where all
persons alleged to be sharing joint ownership are together and could all be
charged with possession the appropriate charge is possession." In my view,
that statement
applies
to
this
case
before
the
court.
The
three
defence
witnesses
were jointly
producing and possessing the marijuana which was being grown.
[
90

Counsel
similarly
relies
on
R.
v.
Gardiner
,
[1987]
O.J.
No.
411
(CA)
,
but
this
case too is distinguishable on the facts.
Paragraph 13 of
Gardiner
is however instructive:
[13]
The
practical
distinction,
as
I
see
it,
between
Young
,
Taylor
and
O'Connor
,
on the one hand, and
Harrington
,
Binkley
, and this
case, on the other, is that in the latter cases, all persons alleged to be
sharing ownership and possession were together and could all be charged with
possession. The claim of joint Possession is,
therefore,
more
credible.
In
the
former
cases,
the
persons
alleged
to
be
sharing
possession were
not
present
and
might
not
have
been.
successfully charged with possession. The consequences of the claim for
joint possession in those cases are practically less credible. This case falls
within the category of
Harrington
and
Binkley
, and I so decide.

R. v. Neal

,
[2010] O.J. No. 1518 (CA)
(
sub nom
.
R.
v. Sansalone
)
is one of the leading cases on the definition of
trafficking. Delivering judgment for the Court, Justice LaForme found:
[25]
…
Parliament
has
determined
that
the
traffic
in
narcotics
such
as
GHB
poses
a significant risk to society. They have therefore enacted wide ranging
legislation to prohibit this trade. I agree with the reasons of Dubé J.A. in
R.
v. Rousseau
, (1992),
1991 CanLII 3345 (QC CA)
, 70
C.C.C.
(3d)

at
451
(Que.
C.A.),
leave
ref'd,
[1992]
S.C.C.A.
No.
394, that the
intention of Parliament was to "prohibit all forms of action which
encompass the circulation of narcotics."
[26]
The
definitions
of
"sell"
and
"traffic"
in
the
CDSA
,
in
my
view,
cast
a
very
wide net,
the
goal
of
which
is
to
facilitate
prosecution
of
individuals
who
participate
in
or
contribute to the trafficking of narcotics.
[27]
The appellant proposes a definition of "sell" and
"traffic" that, when read with the
Criminal
Code
provisions
on
conspiracy,
would
limit
criminal
liability
to
actions taken
up
to
the
point
at
which
drugs
are
delivered.
In
my
view,
such
a
narrow
view
of
drug
transactions
is
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
CDSA
and
Criminal
Code
.
[28]
Indeed, the appellant's view is that by enacting a wide
definition of "sell" that creates
liability
for
people
participating
in
various
aspects
of
drug
transactions
such as
delivery
under
the
CDSA
,
Parliament
simultaneously
truncated
the
applicability of
the
Criminal Code
's
conspiracy provisions to these same transactions. If
this were correct, the
CDSA
and
Criminal Code
would be working at
cross purposes.
[29]
The
appellant
is
however
correct
to
note
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
Crown to prove that payment has been made
in order to establish that a drug was sold. Nevertheless,
this
does
not
make
the
payment
of
money
irrelevant
to,
or
separate from, the drug transaction. The
definition of sell includes distributing, "whether or not the distribution
is made for consideration." I read this as meaning that distributing
without
receiving
consideration
is
selling,
as
is
distributing
in
exchange for
consideration.

Mr. Huang and the other members of
his friend group who contributed to the purchase
of
the

buy
were
not

joint

drugs.
There
may
have
been joint ownership, but there was
no joint possession. Joint ownership of a
substance does not prohibit the “trafficking” of the substance from one owner
to another.

is
almost
directly
on
point:
[16]
The words which I have underlined indicate what the appellant
could well be found to have been doing with the bulk hashish on the night in
question; the purpose
for
which
it
was
in
his
possession.
These
words
have
been
defined
by
the Oxford Universal
Dictionary as follows:
"give"
--
to
bestow
gratuitously;
to
render
without
payment;
to
deliver;
to
hand over; to allot; to
apportion; and to yield.
"deliver" -- to hand over to another's possession or keeping;
to give or distribute to the proper person or quarter; to present.
"distribute" -- to deal out or bestow in portions or shares
among many or a number of recipients; to allot or apportion as his share to
each person of a number; to spread.
[17]
In each case the word contemplates a physical act involving two
or more persons and it is important to note that these verbs can operate
independently of and
without
reference
to
the
ownership
or
change
of
ownership
of
the
object
given, delivered or distributed.
In
other words, one can "give", "deliver" or
"distribute" an object
to
another or others
regardless
of
whether
that object is
owned
by
the one, another
or
others
or
all
or
none
of
them.
Here
there
was
ample
evidence,
including the
testimony
of
the
appellant,
that
the
appellant's
purpose
in
bringing
the
hashish to
his
home
on
the
day
in
question
was
to
"give",
"deliver"
or
"distribute"
it
to
some or all of the others, as well as to
take some for his own use.
[18]
The gravamen of the charge of trafficking is possession plus the
intent or purpose of physically making the hashish available to others,
regardless of ownership. The simple fact that it was economic for the purchase
price to be collected in advance from the potential users of the narcotic and a
bulk purchase made, thereby vesting in such users some claim to ownership and
title and even a deemed joint possession by them, does not alter the nature of
the physical act of giving, delivering or distributing
the narcotic to
another
or others,
which in itself
constitutes the offence.
[

Despite the fact that Mr. Huang
and all his friends may have been joint owners of the
bulk
purchase,
it
is
Mr.
Huang
that
had
possession
of
the
bulk
purchase.
He
kept
it
at
his house, he had control over the supply, he manipulated that supply such that
it could be
transformed
from
rock
form
into
powder
or
capsules,
he
put
portions
of
the
supply
into baggies
for
his
friends
to
consume,
he
got
the
drugs
ready
for
his
friends
when
they
called him
and
told
him
they
were
ready
to
pick
it
up,
he
put
the
drugs
in
the
packages
destined for Miami, he wrote the names on the baggies, he was the one
who on his own went to the dealer and made the bulk purchase.
[

Mr. Huang’s actions clearly fit
within the wide definition of trafficking. He had possession of the bulk
supply, together with intent to traffic in that supply to his friends.
