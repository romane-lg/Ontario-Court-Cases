WEINSTEIN
J.:
[
1
]
Mr.
Idoko
is
alleged
to
have
sexually
assaulted
G.B.
on
May
5,
2023.
[
2
]
G.B.
and
Mr.
Idoko
were
friends
attending
the
same
university.
They
spent
the evening
of
May
4
th
and
early
morning
of
May
5
th
,
2023,
celebrating
G.B.’s
birthday
with
a group
of
friends.
The
celebration
started
at
G.B.’s
apartment
before
the
group
boarded
a party bus to go to a bar. The events
giving rise to these allegations occurred when G.B. and Mr. Idoko returned to
her apartment at the end of the night.
[
3
]
It is not disputed that G.B. and
Mr. Idoko engaged in consensual sexual activity while at
the
apartment.
What
is
in
dispute
is whether
this
sexual
activity included
vaginal intercourse. On this point, there
are two competing and markedly different accounts of what took place. G.B.
alleges that there was sexual intercourse while Mr. Idoko claims there was not.
[
4
]
G.B.
testified that
she
clearly
felt
Mr.
Idoko
put
his
penis
into
her
vagina.
She
said it
lasted
for
about
30
seconds
and
that
she
had
to
push
him
off
her
to
get
him
to
stop.
G.B.
testified
that
afterward,
Mr.
Idoko
admitted
that
he
had
put
his
penis
inside
her.
She then ran out of her
room crying, woke up her roommate and kicked Mr. Idoko out of the apartment.
The police were called almost immediately after he left.
NOTE:
This judgment is under a publication ban
described in the WARNING page at
the start of this document.
If
the WARNING page is missing, please contact the court office.
[
5
]
Mr. Idoko testified that there was
never any penile penetration. He claims that although he was interested in
having sex with G.B., he respected her wishes when she said no. To the extent
G.B. felt anything in her vagina, it was his fingers. Mr. Idoko acknowledges
telling
G.B.
that
he
had
put
his
penis
inside
of
her.
He
maintains,
however, that he was joking.
[
6
]
This
was
a
short
trial
with
the
evidence
completed
in
one
day.
The
Crown
called
G.B.
and
her
roommate, W.M.
Mr.
Idoko
testified
in
his
own
defence.
[
7
]
The critical issue in this case is
whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable
doubt
that
Mr.
Idoko
engaged
in
non-consensual
sexual
intercourse
with
G.B.
Resolving this issue requires an assessment of the credibility and reliability
of G.B. and Mr. Idoko.
[
8
]
The Crown submits
that G.B. was an entirely
credible and reliable witness whose
evidence
should
be
accepted.
Moreover,
Mr.
Idoko’s
suggestion
that
he
was
joking
when he
told
G.B.
that
he
engaged
in
sexual
intercourse
should
be
rejected.
Rather,
the
Crown argues that his statement should be
recognized for what it was, an admission to the alleged act. Alternatively, the
Crown submits that Mr. Idoko’s testimony established that he failed to take
reasonable steps to ascertain G.B.’s consent to the digital penetration and
other sexual activity.
[
9
]
The
defence
submits
that
Mr.
Idoko’s
evidence
should
be
accepted
or
at
least
raise
a reasonable doubt. Counsel argues that there were material inconsistencies in
G.B.’s account that casts doubt on her credibility. Moreover, counsel maintains
that G.B. misperceived what happened. This confusion manifested itself when
G.B. asked Mr. Idoko
whether
he
had
put
his
penis
inside
her. Further, she
expressed
uncertainty
about what happened when she spoke to the
police and paramedics later that evening. It is the position of the defence,
that this uncertainty should raise a reasonable doubt as to whether penile
penetration took place. Finally, counsel submits that by her words and actions,
G.B. provided her communicated consent to the other sexual activity.
The
Elements
of
the
Offence
[
10
]
To
establish
the
offence
charged,
the
Crown
must
prove
that
Mr.
Idoko
intentionally touched G.B. in circumstances of a sexual nature without
her consent and knowing that she did not consent to the touching.
[
11
]
Consent involves G.B.’s state of
mind at the relevant time. It relates to her conscious
agreement
to
take
part
in
every
sexual
act
in
the
encounter.
Her
consent
must have been freely given at the time
each specific sexual act occurred. G.B. can withdraw or
limit
her
consent
at
any
time.
Moreover,
an
agreement
to
take
part
in
one
sexual
act
is
not an agreement to all other specific physical sexual acts. An agreement to
touching of one kind, or of one part of the body, is not an agreement to
touching of all kinds, or to another
part
of
the
body.:
R.
v.
J.A.,
2011
SCC
28
,
at
para.
34
;
R.
v.
Ewanchuk
,
[1999]
1
S.C.R.
330.
[
12
]
To prove the requisite
mens rea
,
an accused must have known that the complainant was not consenting to the
sexual act or was reckless or willfully blind to the absence
of
consent.
In
other
words,
the
Crown
must
prove
either
that
Mr.
Idoko
knew
that
G.B. was not consenting to sexual
intercourse; that he knew there was a risk that she was not consenting but went
ahead anyway; or was wilfully blind to the absence of consent:
R. v. J.A
.,
at para.
24
.
The
principles to
be
Applied
[
13
]
Mr. Idoko is presumed innocent.
There is no obligation on him to do anything to establish
his
innocence.
The
presumption
of
innocence
remains
in
place
unless
and
until the Crown has proven
each essential element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.
[
14
]
Reasonable doubt is based upon
reason and common sense. It is logically connected
to
the
evidence,
or
the
lack
of
evidence.
Reasonable
doubt
requires
more
than mere probability.
Although it cannot be described with mathematical precision, reasonable doubt
is a high standard consistent with its role as a safeguard against wrongful
convictions.
At
the
same
time,
reasonable
doubt
does
not
require
proof
beyond all
doubt
nor
is
it proved to an absolute certainty. Based on the totality of the evidence, I
must be sure of guilt before I convict.
Anything
less must result in an acquittal.
[
15
]
A verdict of guilt may, in appropriate cases, be
safely founded on the evidence of a single witness. This principle applies with
equal force in cases of sexual assault, for which
the
corroboration
rules
were
abolished
by
both
Parliament
and the
Supreme
Court several decades ago.
[
16
]
As stated, the Crown’s case stands
or falls on my findings of credibility and reliability
of
G.B.
and
Mr.
Idoko.
Credibility
relates
to
the
honesty
of
the
witness
including whether the witness was trying
to tell the truth and if the witness was candid, sincere, biased, or prone to
exaggeration or minimization. Reliability relates to the accuracy of a
witness’s testimony and involves a consideration of the person's ability to
accurately observe, recall and describe the events in issue. Any witness whose
evidence is not credible
cannot
give
reliable
evidence
on
the
same
point.
However,
credibility
alone
does not establish reliability as a
truthful witness may not give reliable evidence.
[
17
]
In assessing a witness’s
credibility and/or reliability, judges may consider the presence or absence of
inconsistencies in a witnesses’ evidence. What weight a trial judge will place
on an inconsistency will depend on the nature of the inconsistency.
[
18
]
In assessing the evidence, I may
accept all, some, or none of a witness’s testimony. However, I must ensure that
I do not apply different standards of scrutiny to the
evidence
of
the
Crown
and
the
defence:
R.
v.
Phan
,
2013
ONCA
787
,
at
paras.
29
-
34.
I
must
also
avoid
a
piecemeal
approach
to
the
evidence.
The
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
does
not
apply
to
individual
items
of
evidence,
but
only
to
the
court’s final determination as to guilt
based on the essential features of the offences charged.
[
19
]
I
must
also
caution
myself
concerning
the
demeanour
of
witnesses.
Although
I
am permitted
to
consider
a
witness’s
demeanour
in
assessing
credibility,
I
must
not
place
undue weight
on
it
or
permit
it
to
be
a
determining
factor
in
my
analysis:
R. v.
E.H
.,
2020 ONCA
405
,
at
para.
91
.
I
should
be
particularly
cautious
about
relying
on
emotional
upset as
an
indicator
of
truthfulness,
given
that
emotional
presentation
varies
by
witness,
and
I
lack a baseline for evaluation:
R. v. Reimer
,
2024 ONCA 519
, at para.
93
.
[
20
]
The Supreme Court recently made
clear
in
R. v. Kruk,
2024 SCC 7
that, so long as
a
trial
judge
does
not
engage
in
prohibited
reasoning
based
on
myths
and
stereotypes, trial
judges
are
expected
to
rely
on
common
sense
and
experience
in
determining
issues of
credibility
and
reliability.
In
doing
so,
however,
I
should
exercise
caution
about
making ungrounded assumptions that are
not based on the evidence.
[
21
]
Although
this
trial
primarily
involved
the
testimony
from
Mr.
Idoko
and
G.B.,
it
is
not
a contest to determine who I believe. Our law mandates that a criminal trial is
not a credibility contest and can never be resolved by a judge simply selecting
whose version of
events
they
prefer.
Lack
of
credibility
on
the
accused’s
part
does
not
equate
to
proof
of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt:
R.
v. J.H.S.,
2008 SCC 30
, at para.
13
. Rather, I must be
guided
by
the
principles
articulated
in
R.
v.
W.(D
.),
1991
CanLII
93
(SCC)
:
(i)
if
I
accept
the evidence upon which the defence relies, I must acquit; (ii) if I do not
accept that evidence, but it leaves me in a state of reasonable doubt, I must
acquit; (iii) I must nonetheless
acquit
unless
I
am
satisfied
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
based
on
the
evidence I do accept, considered in the context of the evidence as a whole.
[
22
]
In
assessing
whether
to
accept
the
defendant’s
evidence
the
Court
must
consider
all the evidence, including the evidence of the complainant. A considered and
reasoned acceptance
of a
complainant’s evidence beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is a
sufficient
basis to reject the testimony of the
defendant:
R. v. J.J.R.D.
,
2006 CanLII 40088 (ON CA)
,
[2006]
O.J. No. 4749 (C.A.)
at paragraph
53
.
[
23
]
While it is open to reject the
evidence of the accused if the Court accepts the evidence of the complainant,
there may be occasions where the Court believes both the accused
and
the
complainant.
In
such
a
case,
the
Court
will
be
left
in
a
reasonable
doubt.
Summary
of
the
Relevant
Facts
[
24
]
I will provide a summary of each witness’s
testimony and refer to the salient features of their evidence as it relates to
the relevant issues.
Evidence
of
G.B.
[
25
]
G.B.
was
celebrating
her
20
th
birthday
with
Mr.
Idoko
and
other
friends.
The
group first gathered
at her apartment for a pre-party. They then boarded a
party bus to go to Grace O’Malley’s bar. G.B. remained at Grace O’Malley’s
until approximately 2:30 a.m. when she, Mr. Idoko and two others, T. and M.,
went back to G.B.’s apartment.
[
26
]
G.B. consumed a significant amount
of alcohol that evening. She had a double vodka with dinner and Jello shots at
her apartment. She also recalls sharing a Sprite bottle mixed
with
vodka
while
on
the
party
bus
and
having
a
shot at
Grace
O’Malley’s. G.B.
described that she was intoxicated when she returned to her apartment. She
explained that she was aware of her surroundings but her reaction times were
slower.
[
27
]
When they returned to the
apartment, Mr. Idoko went into her
bedroom
to charge his
phone while G.B.
stayed
in
the
living
room with
T.
and
M.
At
some
point
her roommate,
W.M.,
texted
G.B.
to
say
it
was
too
loud.
Not
long
after,
T.
and
M.
left to
go
home.
However,
Mr.
Idoko
said
he
was
unable
to
leave
because
his
roommate
had a girl over.
[
28
]
G.B.
was
tired
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed.
She
told
Mr.
Idoko
that
he
could
sleep
on the
living
room
couch.
However,
he
did
not
leave
the
room
and
instead
kept
laying
on
the
bed. G.B. said that she just wanted to go sleep and so she laid down next to
Mr. Idoko.
[
29
]
Not long after, Mr. Idoko laid on
top of G.B. and started to kiss her. He then proceeded to take off G.B.’s dress
before undressing himself. After they were both underdressed Mr. Idoko touched
her breasts and put his fingers into her vagina. However, at one-point
G.B. put
her
hand
over
her
vagina to
signify
that she
did
not
want to have sexual intercourse. G.B. claimed that Mr. Idoko
proceeded to remove her hand and place his penis inside of her without a
condom. G.B. acknowledged that she never saw Mr. Idoko put his penis inside of
her. However, she maintained that she knew the difference between the feeling
of a finger and penis. She was certain it was Mr. Idoko’s penis that she felt.
[
30
]
In her examination in-chief, G.B.
testified that except for the kissing, all sexual activity leading up to the
penile penetration was non-consensual. However, when she was taken to her
police statement in cross-examination, G.B. corrected herself and said that
only the penile penetration was without her consent. When asked about this
discrepancy,
G.B.
said
she
misspoke
in
examination-in-chief
and
apologized
for
creating
confusion. G.B. maintained that she was not trying to misrepresent what had
happened.
[
31
]
G.B. testified that she
recalled Mr.
Idoko thrusting his
penis,
causing her
to flinch or jump back
into the mattress. After about 30 seconds, G.B. pushed Mr. Idoko in the chest
and he then stopped. G.B. said that she then asked him “what did you do? and
“why
did
you
do
that…you
knew
I
was
a
virgin”.
G.B.
testified
that
Mr.
Idoko
admitted
that he had sex with her and then said
“well, you are not a virgin anymore.”
[
32
]
G.B. then ran out of the room
naked and crying hysterically. She first went to the bathroom
and
saw
that
she
was
bleeding
from
her
vagina.
G.B.
then
woke
up
W.M.
to
tell her
what
happened.
W.M.
confirmed
that
G.B.
came
in
naked,
panicking
and
crying.
[
33
]
G.B. and W.M. then devised a plan to get Mr. Idoko out
of the apartment. They went back into G.B.’s bedroom and told him that he had
to leave because it was getting too loud. He then packed his stuff and left the
apartment. G.B. and W.M. both testified that G.B. was still crying at this
point.
[
34
]
G.B.
called
911
after
Mr.
Idoko
left
the
apartment.
The
entirety
of
the
911
call
was played in court. G.B. is crying
hysterically throughout the call. She told the operator that she thought that
she had been raped but refused to provide Mr. Idoko’s name. Instead, she said
that she first wanted “to see what the test says”. She also said that Mr. Idoko
told her that he “put it in” but that she did not remember all of it. G.B.
denied defence counsel’s suggestion that she was unsure whether in fact Mr.
Idoko had penetrated her. Rather,
she
explained
that
she
was
in
shock
and
wanted
to
make
sure
that
she
was
safe before she gave details. She also
said that she was in disbelief that someone who she considered a friend had
done that to her.

When
emergency
personnel
arrived,
she
told
the
paramedic
“I
don’t
remember
all of it…I don’t want to get him in trouble if maybe…” She never
completed her thought to the paramedic. However, G.B. denied that she was
intending to say, “if maybe he never penetrated
me”.
She
maintained
that
she
intended
to
say
that
she
did
not
want
to
get
Mr.
Idoko in trouble because he was one of her friends.
Mr.
Idoko’s
Evidence
[
36
]
Mr.
Idoko
testified
that
about
an
hour
after
arriving
back
at
the
apartment,
G.B.
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
bed
and
offered for
him
to
sleep
on
the
couch.
He told
her
that he would
leave but
was waiting
for
roommate
to
message
him
telling
him
he
could come home. He then remained in the bed while G.B. laid
down. Not long after, they began
kissing.
[
37
]
Mr.
Idoko
testified
that
his
motive
that
night was
to
have
sex
with
G.B.
He
said that he twice asked whether she
wanted to have sex and both times she said ‘no’. Mr. Idoko
removed
his
shirt
and
pants
as
he
and
G.B.
were
kissing.
He
said
that
she
removed her
clothes,
initially
keeping
on
her
bra
and
underwear
but
that
she
later
took
off
her
bra.
Mr. Idoko then pulled down G.B.’s underwear and took off his pants. When he
did, G.B. covered her vagina. He said that he understood that to mean that she
did not want to have sex and that she also told him “don’t put it in.” He then
kept going and continued kissing G.B.
[
38
]
Mr. Idoko claims
that G.B. eventually removed her
hand from her vagina and that he then
began fingering her.
He said that he
used as
many as three
fingers and that he was switching levels
of intensity as he was doing so. He claimed that he never saw her jump
or
flinch.
Instead,
Mr.
Idoko
claims
that
G.B.
was
moaning
and
making
sounds
which he interpreted to mean that she was consenting.
[
39
]
Mr. Idoko testified that despite
her
earlier refusals, his goal
remained to have sex with G.B. He
thought
that if
he “warmed her
up a
bit,
it will
change
her
position”.
He said that he asked her again and that she again said ‘no’. He then said that
he kept fingering
her
but
that
G.B.
eventually
stopped
giving
feedback.
He
then
stopped
because he realized that he was wasting his time. Mr. Idoko denied that
G.B pushed him off. However, he did agree that her demeanour had changed
completely at that point.
[
40
]
Mr. Idoko said that there was no
point where there could have been penile penetration.
He
said
that
based
on
how
he
was
positioned,
it
would
have
been
impossible for
him
to
insert
his
penis
into
her
vagina.
Rather
than
being
in
the
missionary
position
as described by G.B., Mr. Idoko claims
that he was laying on his side
with
one hand on her side and one hand near the vagina.
[
41
]
Mr.
Idoko
testified
that after
the
sexual
activity stopped, G.B.
remained
quiet. She eventually asked whether he
had put in his penis. He claimed that he did not take the question seriously
and that he said ‘yes’ because there was no way it could have happened.
Mr.
Idoko
said
that
G.B.
became
quiet
again
before
saying
“you knew
I
was
a
virgin”. He admitted that he then
said “too bad you are not a virgin” anymore. He maintained that he did not
think it was a serious question so he gave a joking response. He also said that
he was hoping that if she thought intercourse had already happened, she would
be more inclined to have sex with him again. She did not. Instead, she kept
asking questions. At that point, he said that he gave up on intercourse
happening and then told her that they did not have sex.
[
42
]
Mr. Idoko testified that G.B. then
left the bedroom. She and her roommate came back
a
short
time
later
and
kicked
him
out
of
the
apartment.
Mr.
Idoko
said
that
he
did
not think
anything
of
the
fact
that
he
was
being
asked
to
leave.
Rather,
he
believed
that
G.B.
was tired and wanted to go to bed. He then gathered his belongings and left. He
claims that
he
did
not
notice
if
G.B.
was
upset
when
she
returned
to
the
bedroom.
Indeed,
at
no point did he see her crying or appear
to be upset.
Analysis
[
43
]
The main question to be resolved
in this case is whether the Crown has proved beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
Mr.
Idoko
engaged
in
non-consensual
sexual
intercourse
with G.B. The answer to this question must begin with an examination of Mr.
Idoko’s evidence. If I accept his testimony or if it leaves me in a reasonable
doubt, I must acquit
him.
[
44
]
An assessment of Mr. Idoko’s denials must begin with
his admission to G.B. that he put his penis inside her.
[
45
]
I reject his evidence that this
comment was a joke. It simply makes
no
sense that Mr. Idoko would
have
joked about
engaging in sexual intercourse. There was absolutely nothing in
the leadup to this
discussion
that
suggested G.B. was joking or
was
not being serious
when
she
asked
him
if
he
put
his
penis
inside.
G.B.
was
not
smiling
or
asking
the questions in a playful manner.
[
46
]
Mr.
Idoko
knew
G.B.
did
not
want
to
have
sexual
intercourse.
She
was
also
clearly
upset
after
Mr.
Idoko
first
told
her
that
he
had
put
his
penis
inside.
She
asked
him
why
he
would do it knowing that she was a virgin. This is not the sign of someone who
was treating
this
like a
joke.
Once
it was
obvious that she was upset, it
does
not
make sense that
Mr.
Idoko
would
then
double
down
by
telling
her
again
that
he
had
sexual
intercourse. It certainly did not invite a callous response of words
along the lines of “I guess you are no longer a virgin.” This was not a joke.
It was a rude insensitive response by someone who was clearly upset that G.B.
did not want to have sex with him.
[
47
]
The credibility of Mr. Idoko’s
evidence is further undermined when examined through
the
lens
of
the
other
explanation
he
provided
for
saying
what
he
said.
Rather
than it being a joke,
Mr. Idoko said that he had an insidious motive behind his comments. He said
that he believed that if he told G.B. that they had sexual intercourse, she
would be more
inclined
to
do
it
again.
This
explanation
is
troubling
on
several
fronts.
Firstly,
the
fact that Mr. Idoko would lie and resort
to trickery to convince her to have sex suggests that he
is
someone
who
really
does
not
care
about
a
woman’s
choice
on
whether
to
have
sex or
not.
More
significantly,
it
is
totally
illogical
to suggest
that G.B.
would
be
more
likely
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse
after
being
told
that
her
earlier
refusals
were
ignored. In
my view, Mr. Idoko’s evidence on this
issue was a futile attempt to cover up the fact that he had admitted engaging
in the alleged acts.
[
48
]
There
were
other
aspects
of
Mr.
Idoko’s
evidence
that
did
not
make
sense
or
was highly improbable. For example, his
assertion that sexual intercourse would have been impossible because of the way
he was positioned is simply not sustainable.
Firstly, Mr. Idoko’s evidence on his positioning evolved between
examination in-chief and cross- examination. Initially, Mr. Idoko testified
that he was on top of G.B. but leaning towards his
side
as
he
fingered
her.
Perhaps
realizing
that
it
would
not
take
much
of
an
adjustment to
penetrate
her
with
his
penis,
Mr.
Idoko
changed
his
evidence
in
cross-examination.
He then
claimed
that
he
was
laying
on
his
side.
In
my
view,
Mr.
Idoko’s
inconsistency
on
this point and his ultimate evidence that
he was at her side rather than in the missionary position
was
a
feigned
attempt
to
double
down
on
his
claim
that
G.B.
could
only
have
felt his fingers inside of her.
[
49
]
Further,
Mr.
Idoko’s
evidence
about
G.B.’s
demeanour
after
the
fact
is
not
credible.
Having regard to the unchallenged evidence that G.B. was panicking and crying
hysterically until the police arrived as well as her demeanour on the 911 call,
I find it unlikely, if not impossible, that Mr. Idoko would not have noticed
that she was crying or upset when she kicked him out of the apartment.
[
50
]
In
short,
I
find
that
much
of
Mr.
Idoko’s
account
was
contrived.
I
reject
his
account
that
there
was
no
penile
penetration
and
his
evidence
does
not
raise
a
reasonable
doubt.
[
51
]
Before
examining
G.B.’s
evidence,
I
wish
to
address
an
issue
I
raised
with
counsel
in submissions. I was concerned that although defence counsel put Mr. Idoko’s
position to
G.B.
in
broad
strokes,
there
were
many
aspects
of
Mr.
Idoko’s
evidence
that
was
never
put to G.B. in cross-examination. I was concerned that the defence had failed
to comply with
the rule of
Browne v. Dunn
,
1893 CanLII 65 (FOREP)
,
6 R.
67 (H.L.)
.
[
52
]
While
the rule in
Browne v.
Dunn
is not an absolute rule, it is a rule about fairness. In my view, G.B.
had no opportunity to respond to much of the conflicting evidence presented by
the defence. This was clearly a breach of the rule. The breach is somewhat
muted, however, because G.B. was clear and unequivocal in her evidence about
what had occurred. Further, the Crown did not seek a remedy concerning these
breaches. Accordingly, having regard to the Crown’s position, I have not drawn
an adverse inference from the failure to put the defence position to G.B.
[
53
]
Having rejected Mr. Idoko’s
testimony, I must now assess the totality of the evidence to determine
whether
on the evidence I do accept, the Crown has satisfied me of Mr. Idoko’s
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
54
]
I find that G.B. was a credible witness. She testified
in a manner that was clear, compelling, and persuasive. She was consistent and
unshaken on the key elements of her
evidence
as
they
related
to
the
sexual
assault
and
her
communicated
lack
of
consent.
[
55
]
G.B.’s
evidence
was
not,
however,
without
its
issues.
She
did
not
recall
all
details
from
that
evening.
More
significantly,
she
was
inconsistent
about
which
of
the
sexual
acts
prior
to
intercourse
were
consensual.
During
examination
in-chief
she
said
that
other
than the
kissing,
all
the
sexual
activity
prior
to
the
penetration
was
not
consensual.
After
being presented
with her police statement in cross-examination, G.B. corrected herself and
acknowledged that except for the sexual intercourse, all the sexual activity
was
consensual.
[
56
]
Having reviewed the entirety of her
evidence, I accept G.B.’s explanation for the discrepancy. Listening again to
the audio of her testimony, I believe that she was genuinely surprised by what
had been misunderstood in her testimony. When the discrepancy was presented to
her, G.B. clarified that it was Mr. Idoko moving her hand and penile
penetration that were not consensual. Having experienced a traumatic event
coupled with the challenges of testifying in court, it is understandable that
G.B. did not recall
all
the
details
or
was
mistaken
in
aspects
of
her
recollection,
especially
when
those details did not relate to the
alleged criminal offence. I reject the defence suggestion that these
inconsistencies are because G.B. had fabricated the allegations.
[
57
]
The
defence
also suggests
that
G.B.’s
questions
to Mr.
Idoko in the
bedroom
and her
comments to the paramedic reveal that she was unsure whether intercourse had in
fact
taken
place.
G.B.
explained
that
her
questions
and
comments
were
not
because
she was unsure about what had happened. Rather, she was in shock that
someone she thought of as a friend would violate her. G.B.’s
sense of shock is entirely reasonable in
the circumstances. Moreover, given the hysterical state G.B. was
in
when
speaking with the
police,
her
use
of
the
words
“I
think”
or
her
not
remembering
all
the
surrounding
details do not unduly impact her credibility or reliability. To
the extent that there were memory gaps, they do not reflect adversely on G.B.’s
credibility or reliability.
[
58
]
I
have
considered
G.B.’s
evidence
carefully,
particularly
considering
the
concerns raised about her credibility and
reliability. Looking at the whole of the evidence, the inconsistencies and
other concerns expressed about G.B.’s account do not cast doubt about
the
credibility
or
reliability of
the core
aspects
of
her
account
that
Mr.
Idoko
put
his penis in her vagina without her consent.
[
59
]
That, however, does not end the analysis. A
determination of whether there was penile penetration depends upon G.B.’s core
assertion that she felt Mr. Idoko’s penis inside
her
vagina.
It
is
true,
as
the
defence
argues,
that
G.B.
did
not
see
Mr.
Idoko
put
his penis
in
and
that
her
conclusion
that
it
was a
penis
was
based
on
feeling.
However,
G.B. was
adamant
that
she
felt
Mr.
Idoko
put
his
penis
inside.
She
was
clear
and
unequivocal that she knew the difference
between a finger and penis. She was certain that what she felt was his penis.
G.B. provided a detailed account of what it felt like and how she distinguished
it from a finger. G.B. explained her feeling in this way:
Cross-examination
Q.
Okay.
So
you
didn't
actually
see
any
penetration?
It's,
it's,
it's
tactile?

the
difference
between
a
finger
and
a
penis.
Yes.
Q.
Okay.
No.
So,
so
you
didn't
see
it,

Correct.
The
covers
were
over
top
of
him.
Q.
Okay.

what you're saying is completely based on tactile sensation, is that correct?
That – tactile means touch.

was
thrusting
as

Q.
When
my
friend
asked
you
whether
you
saw
the
vaginal
penetration
or
just felt it, you
indicated that you can feel the difference between a finger and a penis.
Is there any further description that you
can give to that?
A.
I jumped and you can feel the size difference, the, the width,
the, the thrusting motion.
That's all
tactile things that you can feel.
And
even when covers are on top of you you know when someone's inserting themself
into your vagina, I say.
…
Q.
What
about
Mr.
Idoko's
positioning
in
respect
of
your
body
indicated
to
you
that he was using his penis not his hand?
A.
His hips were on top of my hips.
Like, where his penis was was lined up with where my vagina was
in terms of height and – like if I'm lying down, he's on
top
of
me,
his
–
our
–
like
his
penis
was
at
the
same
position
as
my
vagina.
[
60
]
I accept that G.B. was able to
reliably determine that there was penile-vaginal penetration.
In
doing
so,
I
am
reminded
of
the
following
comments
of
Justice
Martin
in
R.
v.
Kruk
at
para.
109
:
Where
a
person
with
a
vagina
testifies
credibly
and
with
certainty
that
they
felt penile
‑
vaginal
penetration, a trial judge must be entitled to conclude that they are
unlikely
to
be
mistaken.
While
the
choice
of
the
trial
judge
to
use
the
words “a
woman”
may
have
been
unfortunate
and
engendered
confusion,
in
context, it is
clear the judge was reasoning that it was extremely unlikely that the
complainant
would
be
mistaken
about
the
feeling
of
penile
‑
vaginal
penetration because people generally,
even if intoxicated, are not mistaken about that sensation. In other words, the
judge’s conclusion was grounded in his assessment of the complainant’s
testimony.
[
61
]
G.B.’s
credibility
and
reliability
is
also
enhanced by
several
pieces
of
confirmatory
evidence.
Indeed,
Mr.
Idoko
confirms
many
aspects
of
G.B.’s
narrative.
He
confirmed
that
G.B. covered her vagina with her
hand to indicate that she did not
want
to have sex. He also confirmed that G.B.’s demeanour changed after the sexual
activity ended. Most significantly, Mr. Idoko confirmed that he told G.B. that
he put his penis inside her and that she was no longer a virgin.
[
62
]
G.B.’s demeanour following the
alleged sexual assault serves as additional circumstantial
evidence
supporting
her
account. Post-event
demeanour
evidence,
or
the emotional
state
of
a
sexual
assault
complainant,
may
be
used
as
circumstantial
evidence to
support
an
allegation
of
sexual
assault:

[
63

G.B.’s
demeanour
during
the
911
call
is
one
of
severe
emotional
trauma.
The
audio
recording
reveals
G.B.
in
obvious
distress;
an
emotional
state
that
stands
in
stark
contrast to Mr. Idoko’s description of
her in the moments after he said their sexual activity came to an end. He
claims he saw no signs of distress. However, W.M. confirmed that G.B. was
highly emotional. She was crying hysterically when she first entered the
bedroom until after the police and paramedics arrived. W.M. was never
challenged on any observations and I find as a fact that G.B. was distraught as
she left the bedroom.
[
64
]
I accept both the credibility and
reliability of G.B.’s evidence completely.
I
find that
G.B.
made
it
clear
to
Mr.
Idoko
that
she
did
not
want
to
have
sex.
Her
subjective
lack of consent would have been apparent
to Mr. Idoko. On his own evidence, Mr. Idoko confirms
that
she
twice
said
no
to
sex.
Moreover,
she
was
covering
her
vagina
which
was
further unequivocal evidence of her non-consent. From her words and actions I
am satisfied that Mr. Idoko knew G.B. was not consenting to sexual intercourse.
[
65
]
The courts
have long
acknowledged
that “no” does
not mean keep
trying.
This is a reality that Mr. Idoko would have done well to acknowledge and
accept.
He did not. Instead, Mr.
Idoko launched himself
on a course
of unwanted sexual
conduct to
achieve his stated goal of having sexual intercourse with G.B. that evening.
[
66
]
As I am satisfied that there was
penile penetration, I do not need to address the alternate route of liability
advanced by the Crown, namely that Mr. Idoko failed to take reasonable steps to
ascertain consent.
[
67
]
I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Idoko sexually assaulted G.B. as alleged.
