on November 20, 2024
Reasons
for Decision on s. 11(b)
Charter
Application released on January 15,
2025
GOHER IRFAN….…………..…………….………………………….Counsel for the Crown
DAWN
DICKINSON…………….….………………...………………Counsel for the Accused
March, M.G., J. :
Introduction:
1
.
This is a case about the propriety and timing of
a section 11(b) application under the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(“the
Charter
”) post-verdict.  Following two days of hearing of a prior
sexual history, pre-trial application under
s. 276
of the
Criminal Code of
Canada
(the “
Code
”), and a seven-day trial, I found the offender, B.S.
guilty on June 12, 2024 in respect of eight of the eighteen offences with which
he was charged.  All of the crimes committed by him were of a sexual nature. 
His main victim was his cousin, E.W., his junior by some ten years.
2
.
On July 17, 2024, B.S. first notified the Court through
his new counsel of his intention to bring a
s. 11(b)
Charter
application
alleging that his right to be tried within a reasonable time had been infringed
or denied. To that point in time, no whisper of complaint by the defence had
been made about the pace of his proceedings.
3
.
At considerable expense to the publicly funded
legal aid system, B.S. retained new counsel to argue this application before me,
and transcripts were ordered of numerous appearances B.S. made in this Court to
chronicle how his charges proceeded through to the end of trial.
4
.
B.S.’s counsel on the application, not his trial
counsel, urged me to undertake a close examination of the
Jordan
factors
to determine its outcome, and to refuse to summarily dismiss the application as
requested by the Crown.
5
.
At first blush, the argument made by B.S.’s new counsel
appeared compelling.  The Information (“Info. No. 1”) alleging the first set of
charges against him was sworn on March 5, 2021. However, two additional sets of
charges were laid against B.S. complicating somewhat his combined trial on two
of those sets, which ultimately ended on January 15, 2024.
6
.
While it is true his trial took over 34 months,
or more precisely 1046 days, to complete in provincial court and therefore
exceeded the presumptive ceiling of 18 months established by the Supreme Court
of Canada (“SCC”) in its benchmark decision of
R. v. Jordan
,
2016 SCC
27
, upon closer analysis, it is readily apparent that much of the delay was
caused by the defence, or implicitly waived by the defence.
7
.
For the following reasons, I am compelled to
dismiss this application primarily based on the principles of law articulated by
the SCC in its decision of
R. v. J.F
.
2022 SCC 17
.
8
.
In my view, post-verdict 11(b)
Charter
applications ought to be carefully considered by the defence and brought only
in rare and exceptional circumstances. They cannot be concealed in defence
counsel’s back pocket only to be resorted to at the 11
th
hour to
attempt to avoid the consequences of their client’s criminal conviction.
Position of
the Applicant
9
.
The defence submitted that one of the greatest
factors causing B.S.’s trial to be delayed was the late disclosure of crucial
materials to the defence, and Court unavailability.
10
.
The defence contended that B.S. did not waive
his rights under
section 11(b)
of the
Charter
, either explicitly or
implicitly.
11
.
Further, the defence argued that there were no
exceptional circumstances, to which the Crown can point, to justify a refusal
to stay the proceedings against B.S.
12
.
The Crown, it is advanced, failed to mitigate
the delay it witnessed accruing, and B.S.’s trial became a symptom of “the
complacency of delay” as referred to in
Jordan
. Accordingly, a stay is
the only appropriate remedy to address the breach of B.S.’s right to trial
within a reasonable time.
13
.
Regarding the failure by the defence to bring
its 11(b)
Charter
application 60 days in advance of the trial date as
required by the Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice, the defence submits that
the rules are procedural in nature, meant to facilitate a fair and expeditious
determination of
Charter
issues, by ensuring all parties have adequate
notice of intended applications. Noncompliance with the Rules is not fatal. Rules
are meant to be flexible.
14
.
Furthermore, the
s. 11(b)
Charter
right
is dynamic in nature.  The Court must assess whether noncompliance with the
Rules offends fairness, or unjustly disadvantages one party to the point of
insurmountable prejudice.
15
.
Put otherwise, the failure to adhere to a
procedural rule is not ideal; however, it cannot extinguish the importance of upholding
a constitutional right.
16
.
This application, defence counsel submits,
deserves consideration and determination in accordance with the factors specified
for analyzing delay as set out in
Jordan
, and expounded upon by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in
R. v. Coulter
,
2016 ONCA 704
.
Position of
the Respondent
17
.
Crown counsel countered that while there were no
specific waivers of B.S.’s rights under
section 11(b)
of the
Charter
,
there were periods of delay specifically caused or contributed to by the
defence, or delay that was implicitly waived by the defence, as follows:
a)
275 days between September 15, 2021 and June 17,
2022 on account of the defence failure to set trial dates,
b)
102 days between June 17, 2022 and September 27,
2022 attributable to defence counsel’s consent to join previous charges with
more recent ones in a new Information, and
c)
226 days between December 16, 2022 and August 8,
2023 owing to defence counsel’s unavailability for the first date offered to
try this case when the Crown and the Court were ready to commence.
18
.
Crown counsel further contended that two distinct
periods of time were the result of exceptional circumstances causing delay,
namely:
a)
the Covid 19 pandemic (which locally, the Crown submitted was worthy
of a 180 day deduction), and
b)
Crown counsel’s illness on December 20, 2023, preventing oral
submissions from being made at the conclusion of the hearing of trial evidence
until January 15, 2024 (26 days).
19
.
Fatal to the application, the Crown argued, was
the failure by B.S. through his counsel to raise the purported unreasonableness
of the delays engendered in bringing his matters to trial until after his
conviction on June 12, 2024. No exceptional circumstances existed to justify
the application having been brought so late in the day.
20
.
Clearly, trial judges have the power to
summarily dismiss
Charter
applications including those brought under
section 11(b).  The broader interests of justice are not solely informed by those
of the accused’s. They include the need to conduct “all litigation in a fair,
orderly and efficient manner” (see
R. v Cody,
2017 SCC 31
at paras.
201
;
R. v. Allison
2022 ONCA 329
at paras.
57 – 70
).
21
.
An accused is obliged to raise the
unreasonableness of trial delay in a timely manner. When the anticipated end of
trial is known and trial dates are set, the accused has a duty to raise the
issue and bring the application
before the trial
.
22
.
The accused must act diligently. As was made
clear by the SCC in
J.F.
, “While an accused has no legal obligation to
assert their right to be tried within a reasonable time in order for that right
to exist, this does not entitle the accused to do nothing when they believe
that their section 11(b) right is not being or will not be respected.
The Court’s teachings are clear on this point: s. 11(b) does not allow an accused to benefit
unduly from the lengthening of delay, notwithstanding the fact that it is the
Crown that has a constitutional obligation to bring the accused to trial.
” (see
R. v. J.F
, supra,
at para.
58
).
23
.
Inaction on the part of the defence does not
constitute waiver of the period of delay in all instances; however, it is a
relevant factor as to whether delay was indeed waived.
24
.
Further, delay caused as a result of a late
s. 11(b)
Charter
application need not be classified as waiver, since in such
circumstances, delay is more properly attributable to defence caused delay
under the
Jordan
analysis.
25
.
As expressed by the SCC in
J.F.
as well,
“as a general rule, in the context of a single trial, an accused who believes
that the right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed must act
diligently and apply for a remedy before the trial is held (see
R. v. J.F.
,
supra,
at para.
3
).
26
.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances
justifying it, the application must be brought prior to the trial or prior to
the trial’s end where the delay issue crystallized mid-trial. Failure to do so
should be fatal to the claim (see
R. v. Rabba
,
1991 CanLII 7073
(ONCA)
at para.
5
;
R. v. Cortes-Rivera
,
2019 ABCA 62
at para.
3 -7
,
R. v. Yizhak
,
2022 ONCJ 476
at paras.
16 – 35
).
27
.
A failure to express any concern about delay on
the record can lead to a finding that there was a consistent pattern of
complacency on the part of the defence, depriving both the Crown and the Court
from proactively addressing any such concern (see
R. v. Kandeh
[2023]
O.J. No. 5000 (ONCJ) at paras. 36 – 47
).
28
.
Again, in
J.F.
, the SCC was unequivocal
as to the appropriate timing of a
s. 11(b)
Charter
application.  It
ought to be brought
pre-trial
to allow the parties to know in advance
the bounds of reasonableness, so proactive measures can be taken to remedy any delay
(see
R. v. J.F.
,
supra
at para.
35
).
29
.
If the accused does not bring the application under
section 11(b)
of the
Charter
prior to trial, simply put, it is late.
Flowing from its tardiness, the Court must then determine the following two issues:
a)
Are there circumstances in the case that justify the late
application?
b)
If not, what are the consequences of the
lateness?
(see
R. v. Europe
,
2024 ONSC 4867
at paras.
18 - 41
)
30
.
Crown counsel argues that the defence in this
case cannot point to any circumstances to justify its late application.  Consequently,
the Crown and Court were completely deprived of the opportunity to take
immediate steps to remedy the delay.

Some twenty-five transcripts of B.S.’s
appearances before this Court were filed in support of his
s. 11(b)
Charter
application.  Upon my review of them, the written facta prepared by, and oral submissions
made by Crown and defence counsel, I find I need only consider the following

ISSUES
32
.
The history of the proceedings and counsel submissions raise the
following issues for resolution:
a)
Are there legitimate circumstances in this case
that justify the late date upon which the s. 11(b) application was brought?
b)
If not, what are the consequences of the
lateness?
c)
Should the application be summarily dismissed
?
The Law
33
.
In
J.F
., the SCC was dealing with an
accused who was acquitted on all charges at his first trial.  The Crown
successfully appealed, and a re-trial was ordered.  Only at the second trial
did the accused raise the argument that his
s. 11(b)
Charter
rights were
violated.
34
.
Notwithstanding B.S. has only had one trial thus
far, the general principles articulated by the SCC in
J.F.
are more than
simply helpful and instructive to me in my deliberation over B.S.’s application
before me, they guide me almost completely in my determination of its outcome.
35
.
As pointed out by Wagner C.J. in
J.F
.:
[30]        While
Jordan
does
not indicate the point in time when an accused must bring a s. 11(b)
motion, the Court has nonetheless been clear about how it wishes all
participants in the criminal justice system to act: at all stages of the trial
process, everyone must take proactive measures to remedy any delay and to
ensure that the accused is tried in a timely manner (
Jordan
, at
paras.
137‑39
;
R.
v. Thanabalasingham
,
2020 SCC 18
, [2020] 2
S.C.R. 413, at para.
9
).
36
.
Further, the Chief Justice explained:
[33]        Defence
conduct is considered under the
Jordan
framework, since the
delay attributable to the defence is subtracted from the gross total delay
(para. 60). Defence delay has two components: (1) delay waived by the
defence, and (2) delay caused solely or directly by the defence (
Jordan
,
at paras.
61 and 63
;
Cody
,
at para.
26
). Inaction may
amount to illegitimate conduct on the part of the defence, because “[i]llegitimacy
may extend to omissions as well as acts” (
Cody
, at para.
33
). As this Court
said in Cody, the defence may not benefit from its own inaction or
lateness in taking action; it must act proactively:
Accused persons must
bear in mind that a corollary of the s. 11
(b)
right “to be tried
within a reasonable time” is the responsibility to avoid causing unreasonable
delay. Defence counsel are therefore expected to “actively advanc[e] their
clients’ right to a trial within a reasonable time, collaborat[e] with Crown
counsel when appropriate and . . . us[e] court time efficiently” (
Jordan
,
at para.
138
). [para. 33]
[34]        An accused
who sees delay lengthening must therefore respond in a proactive manner. Being
proactive may mean filing a s. 11(b) motion where the accused believes
that their right to be tried within a reasonable time is not being or will not
be respected (
Jordan
, at para.
85
). Like any other
application made by an accused, a motion of this kind must be brought
“reasonably and expeditiously” (para. 85). Lateness in raising delay is
contrary to the proper administration of justice, because such a practice
serves to waste judicial resources. Indeed, the
Jordan
framework
is specifically designed to eliminate inefficient practices that impact on the
justice system (paras. 41 and 116). Bringing a s. 11(b) motion before
the end of the trial allows the accused to alert the Crown and the court to
their concerns about delay. As a result, all parties can take proactive measures
and cooperate to expedite the proceedings.
[35]        It
is generally recognized that an accused who raises the unreasonableness of
delay after trial (
R. v. Rabba
(1991),
1991 CanLII 7073 (ON CA)
, 64
C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.)), and particularly after conviction (
R. v.
Warring
,
2017 ABCA 128
, 347
C.C.C. (3d) 391, at para.
11
;
R. v. C.D.
,
2014 ABCA 392
, 588
A.R. 82), is not acting in a timely manner. In
K.G.K.
, Moldaver J.
interpreted the prospective approach adopted in
Jordan
as
“encourag[ing] pre‑trial s. 11
(b)
applications”
(para. 43 (emphasis added)). The defence is in fact encouraged to act
before the start of the trial, since the
Jordan
framework
allows “the parties to know ‘
in advance
, the bounds of reasonableness so
proactive measures can be taken to remedy any delay’” (
K.G.K.
, at
para.
43
, quoting
Jordan
,
at para.
108
(emphasis in
original)).
[36]        In
short, a duty to act proactively also rests on the accused. As a result, the
accused must indicate that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has
not been respected and, where the circumstances require, bring a motion for a
stay of proceedings in a timely manner. As a general rule, this means before
the trial is held. By the time the trial dates are set, the parties are
generally in a position to know whether the trial delay will exceed the
applicable presumptive ceiling, and the defence can raise any concerns it may
have. However, it is not out of the question that, exceptionally, an
infringement of the s. 11(b) right will reveal itself only once the trial
has begun. In such a case, the accused must also act proactively.
37
.
The SCC was careful to emphasize how mere
silence on the part of the accused does not constitute waiver of his or her
s.
11(b)
Charter
right.  As stated by Wagner C.J. at para. 52:
An accused’s silence or
inaction cannot in itself give rise to an inference that the accused has waived
delay, although it may be a relevant and important factor in the waiver
inquiry. This conclusion is an obvious one given the fact that any person
charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a reasonable time
without having to explicitly state their wish to be protected by this right (
Rabba
;
see also
Morin
, at p. 802). An accused nonetheless has a duty
to raise an infringement of their right to be tried within a reasonable time in
a timely manner. At the risk of repeating myself, an accused may not benefit
from their own inaction or lateness in taking action. The new
framework sanctions an accused’s inaction or lateness in taking action.
Inaction may be considered illegitimate conduct, and the delay associated with
it may be attributed to the defence when the unreasonableness of delay is being
determined (
Jordan
, at paras.
63, 113 and 121
;
Cody
,
at para.
33
).
38
.
Further, at para. 58, the Chief Justice added:
While an accused has no
legal obligation to assert their right to be tried within a reasonable time in
order for that right to exist (
Morin
, at p. 802, cited by the Court
of Appeal, at para. 60), this does not entitle the accused to do nothing
when they believe that their s. 11(b) right is not being or will not
be respected. The Court’s teachings are clear on this point: s. 11(b)
does not allow an accused to benefit unduly from the lengthening of delay,
notwithstanding the fact that it is the Crown that has a constitutional obligation
to bring the accused to trial.
39
.
In
Yizhak
,
supra
, my colleague,
Band J. interpreted and synopsized some of these salient principles as follows:
[27]  
      In
J.F.
,
supra
, the
Supreme Court addressed the timing of s. 11(b) applications. While
Jordan
did
not indicate the point in time when a s. 11(b) application must be brought,
“the [Supreme] Court has nonetheless been clear about how it wishes all
participants in the criminal justice system to act: at all stages of the trial
process, everyone must take proactive measures to remedy any delay and to
ensure that the accused is tried in a timely manner” (para. 30). When an
accused sees delay lengthening, they must “respond in a proactive manner” and
bring a motion “reasonably and expeditiously” (para. 34). The Court accepted
that “it is not out of the question that
exceptionally
, an
infringement of the s. 11(b) right will reveal itself once the trial has begun”
yet, even in such a case, “the accused must also act proactively.” (Para. 36.
Emphasis added.) The accused’s duty to act proactively means that they “must
indicate that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has not been
respected”…. (
Ibid
.)
40
.
The facts in
Yizhak
, supra
were similar
to those in the case before me.  Mr. Yizhak, like B.S., did not bring his
s.
11(b)
Charter
application until after he was found guilty at the
conclusion of his trial.  Only then did Mr. Yizhak announce his intention to
proceed with the application.  He did so despite knowing his trial date was set
with the assistance of his lawyer on February 21, 2021, and with an anticipated
end date of September 9, 2021.  His charges were sworn to in the Information upon
which he was tried before Band J. on September 25, 2019.  Mr. Yizhak, through
his counsel, accepted a trial date 17 months past the date the Information was
sworn.
41
.
In B.S.’s case, the delay was even worse when
the trial was set for him on November 1, 2022.  His first set of charges were
already 20 months old by that point (i.e. the sworn date for Info. No. 1 was
March 5, 2021).  Not a peep was heard from him or his counsel that his trial would
take too long if it was not going to end until November 2023, in other words, a
further year into the future.
42
.
Under the circumstances where the delay was certainly
not waived by the defence explicitly, but at a minimum, acquiesced to, Band J. went
on to dismiss Mr. Yizhak’s s. 11(b) application as follows:
[34]  
      The defence failed to exercise its duty to raise
concerns and to act proactively in February 2021, when the bounds of the trial
became known. That failure prevented all parties from cooperating and taking
steps to remedy the situation. Such inaction constituted
illegitimate
defence conduct
in this case. The accused must not be permitted to run out
the clock in silence, and then be rewarded for doing so after trial.
[35]  
      This application should have been brought in the
spring of 2021, not after trial when nothing could be done to ameliorate the
delay. In the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the defence conduct in
regard to this application is fatal because it is contrary to the proper
administration of justice.
43
.
Later, in emphasizing the
illegitimacy
of
the defence inaction, and using it as a basis for a ‘defence caused delay’ deduction
under the usual
Jordan
rubric for calculating net delay, Band J. stated
at para. 38:
[A]s the Supreme Court
explained at para. 32 of
Cody
,
supra
, “[i]irrespective
of merit, a defence action may be deemed not legitimate in the context of a s.
11(b) application if it is designed to delay
or if it exhibits marked
inefficiency or marked indifference toward delay.
(Emphasis added.)
44
.
In
Kandeh, supra
, my colleague, Webber J.
was faced with a
s. 11(b)
Charter
application post-conviction as well. 
Mr. Kandeh, like B.S., was found guilty of serious offences.  The findings of
guilt following trial were made on July 21, 2022.  On October 25, 2022, the day
before sentencing was to proceed, the defence filed the application.
45
.
The defence argued that the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling of 18 months in provincial court had been exceeded.  22.66
months had elapsed between the swearing of the Information and the submissions
of counsel made on the last day of the trial.
46
.
In stern language, Webber J. summarily dismissed
the application as follows:
19  The
application was not brought in a timely fashion. It was brought
post-conviction. To complicate matters, the trial record is quite literally
devoid of any expression of concern on the part of the applicant that delay was
or was becoming a problem. While clearly an accused is not permitted to sit on
his hands and do or say nothing about accruing delay until the ceiling has been
breached, that is exactly what happened here. To be clear, I do not believe this
to be a result of any subterfuge on the part of the Defence, but I do conclude
that the Defence was quite content with, and at times endorsed, some of the
delay that occurred, and that such behaviour amounted to at best a consistent
pattern of complacency.
20  I have no
reason to believe that a complaint of delay was even on the Applicant's radar
until soon before sentencing submissions were to commence, months after
convictions had been registered. If it was, he did not say or do anything to
communicate as much to the Crown or Court.
21  The
recognised problem with this behaviour is that it can understandably lead other
players in the case to proceed on the basis that delay was not a concern. Thus,
at the very least, the Crown, and for that matter the Court as well, were
deprived of any right to proactively address the issue.
47
.
Webber J. also provided a succinct, but thorough
review of the authorities allowing him to arrive at the conclusion he did.  He
stated:
33  As well,
when I was initially asked or originally asked to summarily dismiss the 11(b)
application, I did not have the benefit of the supporting jurisprudence that I
do now. Firstly, I will refer to the Court of Appeal's decision in
R.
v. Kazman
(2020) O.J. No. 136
, Ontario Court of Appeal, there at
paragraph 14 the Court wrote:
There can be no doubt
that a trial judge has the authority to summarily dismiss motions brought at
trial, including s. 11(b) motions. That power is recognized in Rule 34.03 of
the Criminal Proceedings Rules for the Superior Court of Justice ...The case
law from this court also acknowledges a trial judge's power to summarily
dismiss motions. Without that power, trial judges could not properly control
the proceedings before them..."
34  Justice
Doherty thereafter cites
R. v. Imola
(2019) ONCA 556 at
paragraph 17.
35  The Court
also noted, at paragraph 15, that a trial judge, when asked to summarily
dismiss a motion, must consider broader administration of justice concerns,
including the need to conduct all litigation, including criminal litigation, in
a fair, orderly and efficient manner. It falls to trial judges to decide where
the interests of justice lie in a specific case.
36  When an
11(b) motion such as the one in this case is brought after a conviction, and
the record is all but silent from the Applicant before such date, and thus has
not highlighted 11(b) concerns, the administration of justice is done a
disservice. The Crown and Court have been deprived their post-
Jordan/Cody
entitlement
to timely notice of such grievance, and as well of their right to attempt to
rectify the problem.
37  An
untimely 11(b) application brought postconviction does not ptomote the fair,
orderly, or efficient nature of the litigation, and can attract summary
dismissal.
38
In
R.
v. J.F
., the Supreme Court noted as follows, paragraph 31:
"The
predictability of the new framework makes the parties more accountable and
encourages them to be proactive about delay (
Jordan
, at para.
112
;
R. v. Cody
,
2017 SCC 31
,
[2017] 1 S.C.R. 659
, at para.
36
)."
39  The
decision goes on at paragraph 34:
"An accused who
sees delay lengthening must [I emphasise must] therefore respond in a proactive
manner. Being proactive may mean filing a s. 11(b) motion...Like any other
application made by an accused, a motion of this kind must be brought
'reasonably and expeditiously'... Lateness in raising delay is contrary to the
proper administration of justice, because such a practice serves to waste
judicial resources. Indeed, the
Jordan
framework is
specifically designed to eliminate inefficient practices that impact on the
justice system... Bringing a s. 11(b) motion before the end of the trial allows
the accused to alert the Crown and the court to their concerns about delay. As
a result, all parties can take proactive measures and co operate to expedite
the proceedings."
40  The Crown
and Court have clearly been deprived of this opportunity by the Applicant's
inaction in this case.
41  Paragraph
35:
"It is generally
recognized that an accused who raises the unreasonableness of delay after
trial (
R. v. Rabba
(1991),
1991 CanLII 7073 (ON CA)
,
64 C.C.C. (3d) 445
(Ont. C.A.)), and particularly
after conviction (
R. v. Warring
,
2017 ABCA 128
,
347 C.C.C. (3d) 391
...[that] accused is not acting in a timely
manner."
42  The Court
emphasised that the accused must bring S.11(b) motions in a timely manner, but
perhaps more to the point, the Court stressed that the current 11(b) culture
demands timely proactiveness from the accused. It is an obligation that must be
satisfied.
43  Obviously,
there is nothing about the Applicant's motion here that could possibly satisfy
the expectation that such applications be brought in a timely manner, nor that
the Applicant displayed even an iota of proactivity.
44  Viewing
expectations of the accused from another perspective, the Court noted
specifically that an accused is simply not entitled to do nothing in the face
of impugned delay. The Court further noted, at paragraph 58, as follows:
"While an accused
has no legal obligation to assert their right to be tried within a reasonable
time in order for that right to exist...this does not entitle the accused to do
nothing when they believe that their s. 11(b) right is not being or will not be
respected...s. 11(b) does not allow an accused to benefit unduly from the
lengthening of delay..."
45  Contrary
to this clearly stated expectation of the Supreme Court of Canada, the
Applicant in this case did absolutely nothing about 11(b) until postconviction.
**********************
48  As I turn
to the conclusion, I want to briefly return to the language of Justice Doherty
in
Kazman
, at paragraph 15, where the Court said:
"When asked to
summarily dismiss a motion, a Court must consider broader administration of
justice concerns, including the need to conduct all litigation, including
criminal litigation, in a fair, orderly, and efficient manner. It falls to
trial judges to decide where the interests of justice lie in each specific
case."
49  A
post-trial S.11(b) application, such as we have in this case, threatens to
frustrate each of the broader administration of justice concerns articulated in
this passage. I believe that the interests of justice favour summarily
dismissing this application.
48
.
I was, of course, guided by the decisions of the
SCC and my colleagues as I come to my own conclusions on the application before
me.
Analysis
Do any legitimate
circumstances exist for the failure to bring the s. 11(b) Charter Application until
more than five months post-verdict (June 12, 2024 – November 20, 2024),
thirteen months following the setting of the
s. 276
pre-trial application and
trial dates (November 1, 2022 – November 27, 2023) and twenty-six months after
the Court directed Crown and defence counsel to secure pre-trial application
and trial dates (September 15, 2021 – November 27, 2023)?:
49
.
On a careful review of the transcripts, I cannot
conceive of a legitimate reason why the defence did not put the Crown and Court
on notice of its intention to bring a
section 11(b)
Charter
application
before the conclusion of the trial, if this was a legitimate concern for the
accused.  When the trial dates were finally set on November 1, 2022, the bounds
were certainly set, and in large part, adhered to.
50
.
Additionally, on November 1, 2022 when the
s.
276
Code
application hearing and trial dates were set, one very good,
legitimate reason existed for why trial counsel remained silent as to B.S.’s
s.
11(b)
Charter
rights.  He kept getting charged making her task of
defending him all the more difficult.
51
.
Over the span of his accruing charges, B.S.’s
trial counsel agreed with Crown counsel that it made sense to have the
allegations in Infos. No. 1 and No. 3 tried together.  They involved one of the
same complainants, the main one, B.S.’s younger cousin, E.W.  It was a
sensible, fair concession made by trial counsel for B.S.  It allowed him to
have one trial, not two.
52
.
B.S.’s counsel on the
s. 11(b)
Charter
application
ignores completely the effect B.S.’s accruing charges had on the intricacies of
his case.
53
.
It must be remembered that after B.S. was
originally charged on March 5, 2021, he was arrested and charged again on
October 29, 2021 with offences involving the same complainant, E.W.
54
.
On April 13, 2022, he was charged yet a further
time with more offences relating to E.W. and another complainant.
55
.
In an Agreed Statement of Facts filed on the
hearing of that application, B.S.’s trial counsel and Crown counsel decided it
would be “efficient” to proceed on one replacement Information joining the
allegations set out in Infos. No. 1 and No. 3.  To do so would save court
resources, and the complainant, E.W., would only have to testify once.
56
.
The consequence of the agreement between counsel
meant the trial on the replacement Information would take longer.  It would
require more witnesses to be called, and more issues to be resolved.
57
.
I can safely infer that experienced trial
counsel, who has appeared before me on many occasions and from whose assistance
B.S. greatly benefitted, would have discharged her ethical obligation to share
those pros and cons of joinder with her client, B.S.
58
.
Ultimately, the point is . . . trial dates were
agreed to by Crown and defence over a year into the future beyond their set
date on November 1, 2022.  The presumptive
Jordan
ceiling of 18 months
had already been exceeded in respect of B.S.’s first set of charges.  Yet the
defence stood mute on the issue of delay.  If the time was ripe to ever
complain about that fact the trial would not start until over a year later, it
was then and there.
What are the real
consequences of the late
s. 11(b)
Charter
application brought by the defence?
59
.
In answer to the question posed directly above,
in my humble view, I would say the Court and Crown were literally hogtied by
the defence when the complaint was only raised at the completion of trial. 
There were no means left to address the accused’s concern over delay.  That
ship had veritably sailed.
60
.
In a case I decided some eighteen months ago,
R.
v. K.D
.,
2023 ONCJ 252
, I had this to say about the efforts I am prepared
to go to in order to offer early trial time to those accused who truly desire
it.  I wrote:
63.      As the local administrative judge,
and taking a “bird’s-eye view” I have little hope of ever attempting to meet
the demands placed on scarce judicial resources unless I direct my Trial
Co-ordinator to double-book, triple-book and quadruple-book trial upon trial,
each and every available, Court sitting day. I venture I give up more Chambers
days than the vast majority of trial judges in the OCJ simply in an attempt to
meet the ever-increasing demands for trial time.
61
.
I could have and would have given up Chambers
days to have B.S.’s trial heard earlier if that is what he actually wanted.  My
colleague, Richardson J., would have done likewise, if the matter could have
been brought on before him more quickly.  I have seen him do so on numerous
occasions in the past.
62
.
Later in
K.D
., I went on to say:
106.   K.D.’s case was not an island. It was one of the
many demanding the Court’s attention. The Court did what it could.
107.   Had defence counsel drawn to the Court’s
attention that K.D. was insisting on having his trial completed by April 20,
2022, the date upon which the presumptive ceiling was attained, I have no doubt
whatsoever that the Court and the Crown would have made greater efforts to
attempt to meet his wish.
108.   To the contrary, it is clear to me that counsel
for K.D. had his eye on the ball for when his charges would reach their
supposed, ‘drop dead’ date. He was looking to use his
section 11(b)
Charter
right
as a positive defence. To do so was never the spirit or intent of the accused’s
section 11(b) right. As explained by Moldaver J in
Jordan
:
[21]             At the
same time, we recognize that some accused persons who are in fact guilty of
their charges are content to see their trials delayed for as long as possible.
Indeed, there are incentives for them to remain passive in the face of delay.
Accused persons may seek to avoid responsibility for their crimes by embracing
delay, in the hope that the case against them will fall apart or they
will obtain a stay of proceedings. This operates to the detriment of the public
and of the system of justice as a whole. Section 11
(b
) was not intended
to be a sword to frustrate the ends of justice (
Morin
, at pp. 801-2).
109
.
While I accept that there were reasons why
defence counsel could not have brought the section 11(b) application earlier
than he did, given the nature of
K.D.’s
retainer and
the
need to seek the
approval of Legal Aid Ontario to order transcripts of the proceedings, I find
that he could have and should have said more about the intention to bring an
11(b) application before he agreed to seven days of trial in April 2022. On May
21, 2021, he accepted those dates. Further, on June 15, 2021, he was
specifically informed that April 19, 20, 21 would be the first three dates
reserved for
K.D.’s
trial.  If he was so incensed with those dates
being set that far into the future, he ought to have said so unequivocally,
forcefully and loudly.  That is the type of rancor I expect defence
counsel to raise when asserting the
s. 11(b)
Charter
right of a client.  They are not to
sit on their hands or lay in the weeds.
110
.
Instead, in this case on June 15, 2021,
defence counsel stood mute regarding the
proximity
of
the
conclusion date for the trial to the
presumptive ceiling. In my view, he ought to have spoken up. He did not.
111
.
This Court definitely would have done more to
bring the trial to its conclusion, if properly
placed
on notice, that
K.D.
was insisting on
strict adherence to the 18 month presumptive ceiling. Unfortunately, the Court
received no clear warning the time allotted for completing the trial was taking
too long.
63
.
If I did not state it plainly enough in
K.D.
,
I will now.  Defence counsel cannot use
s. 11(b)
of the
Charter
like an
ace up their sleeve or a secreted dagger under their robes.  They cannot behave
like a cheater at the poker table or a silent assassin.
64
.
The time is not to complain when the trial has
ended.  It is far too late.
65
.
Like Schreck J. in
Europe
, supra
, at paras.
32 - 41
, I would infer that the entire period:
a)
from when trial dates are set,
b)
to the point the trial is anticipated to end,
is a span of time
implicitly waived by the defence.  It is, or ought to be, apparent to the
defence when trial dates are accepted beyond the
Jordan
presumptive limits
in either provincial or superior court, when the bounds are known without a
whisper of objection, it loses its right of complaint over that tract of time.
66
.
In B.S.’s case, with the assistance of counsel,
he set trial dates into the future (i.e. Nov. 1, 2022) knowing his trial would
not end for over a year (i.e. anticipated to be Nov. 23, 2023).  I find he implicitly
waived this period, when neither his counsel, nor he himself chose to voice any
opposition to the wait.  Alternatively, it must constitute defence caused
delay.
Should this
s. 11(b)
Charter
application be summarily dismissed?
:
67
.
It should.  When one takes a holistic view of
what happened in B.S.’s case, the answer is plain.  His accruing charges added
a layer of complexity to the proceedings.  To be clear, none of what he faced
in the way of charges involved intense rumination by the Court over complex
legal issues.  Like so many criminal trials, his turned on issues of
credibility and reliability.  Now, his new counsel on this application wants
those findings brushed aside and his imminent sentencing halted on account of a
purported
s. 11(b)
Charter
violation.
68
.
On my watch, I cannot allow this to occur.  I do
not want to see, as my colleague Webber J. observed in
Kandeh
at para.
36, “the administration of justice . . .done a disservice”.  Long ago, the barn
doors were opened on this case.  The horses were let out.  It is far too late
now to have them rounded up and put back in their stalls to start the day afresh. 
To permit the bringing of
s. 11(b)
Charter
applications post-trial,
except in rare and exceptional circumstances, condones illegitimate defence
conduct.
69
.
Under the circumstances of this case, I must
summarily dismiss this 11(b)
Charter
application brough by B.S.
Non-Standard or
Modified Jordan Calculus:
70
.
In the event I am wrong about my power to
summarily dismiss this 11(b)
Charter
application, I will briefly consider
the required
Jordan
timeline analysis with necessary modifications, as
urged upon me by B.S.’s counsel on the application.
Clearly,
this
case does not lend itself well to standard
Jordan
calculations to
determine delay because of the three different sets of charges B.S. faced
. 
Neither Crown nor defence counsel have assisted me with how I am to do the math
in such a case.
71
.
Suffice to say, it is my view the
Jordan
timelines must be expanded where Crown and defence counsel have agreed, as they
did here, that the allegations for the first and third sets of B.S.’s charges ought
to be tried in the same proceeding.  Given my finding that this application must
be summarily dismissed for the reason I have earlier given, I need not turn my
mind to exactly how much the timelines ought to be extended.
72
.
As far as the two prongs of complaint go (Crown
and Court delay), as made by defence counsel on this application, I can offer
that I am not at all pleased with the amount of time it took for the Crown to
disclose the cell phone extractions.  Their contents contained critical pieces
of evidence, which greatly assisted me in making findings of fact and
credibility at his trial.  They included key electronic exchanges (e.g. texts
and photos) shared between the accused and the complainants.  More must be done
to speed up this forensic disclosure process.

I am given to understand from other cases I have
heard that most of these ‘cell phone dump’ requests, as they have colloquially
become known, are handled at headquarters for the Ontario Provincial Police in
Orillia.  These requests end up in a queue to wait for those with the technical
expertise and ‘know how’ to extract what is stored in the memories of the
various devices they are asked to examine, once they have time to do so.
74
.
Clearly to my mind, more resources are needed to
handle the demands placed on the ‘techies’.  Perhaps more staff has to be
hired.  Or maybe both.
75
.
The fact is . . . so many criminal cases now
turn on exchanges between the accused and the complainant, often over text, as
was the case here.  The police and Crown must be ever mindful of
Jordan
timelines.  The delivery of this type of extraction disclosure has to happen
far more quickly than it is occurring at present.
76
.
It took a long time for disclosure to be made by
the Crown to the defence of the following items:
a)
initial disclosure on the first set of charges
(Mar. 11 – May 18, 2021, 68 days),
b)
cell phone dumps (Dec. 14, 2021 – Mar. 25, 2022,
91 days), and
c)
initial disclosure including cell phone dumps on
the third set of charges (Apr. 13 – Aug. 23, 2022, 132 days).
77
.
I therefore arrive at the sum of 191 days, which
I would characterize as Crown delay in getting disclosure out to the defence.
78
.
Turning my mind to Court delay, the Court took
some time, it appears, to provide a JPT date to Crown and defence counsel in
the first instance (May 18 – August 13, 2021, 87 days).  I offer this
explanation as no excuse, but I note that in this period when the Court was
emerging from the backlog caused by Covid, our ‘two judge jurisdiction’ could
no longer afford ‘burning’ one of its judges by having him do a JPT and having
the other do the trial.  Justice Richardson and I had to seek outside help from
mostly ‘per diem’ judges to handle our JPTs for us.  All of our time as local
Renfrew County provincial court judges was dedicated to doing trial after
trial.
79
.
There were other delays owing to Court unavailability
as well:
a)
May 18 – Aug. 13, 2021 – 87 days (i.e. to obtain
a JPT, assuming one was requested by either Crown or defence at the earliest
opportunity following the CPT; Crown and defence counsel directed to do certain
things, e.g. police to interview secondary witness, Crown to provide position
on early resolution offer, defence to confirm whether
s. 276
application would
be brought), and
b)
Aug. 13 - Sept. 15, 2021 – 33 days (i.e. to
obtain 2
nd
JPT, Crown and defence counsel directed to secure
s. 276
application and trial dates which both ignored.
80
.
I was the judge presiding on September 15,
2021.  When I told counsel to secure pre-trial application and trial dates, I
expected my direction to be acted upon.  It was not.  By that point, I was
alive to the fact that B.S.’s first set of charges were 194 days, or six and a
half months old.  I ordered the matter to be moved along.  That did not happen.
81
.
While I appreciate that B.S.’s matter was then
complicated by a second set of charges laid against him on October 29, 2021,
the problem of delay could have been nipped
in the bud and avoided, if counsel had
heeded what I told them to do.  They did not.  Counsel unilaterally took the
matter off my radar.
82
.
More frustrating still is that as early as May
19, 2021, I was expecting counsel to set JPT and trial dates.
83
.
The sad reality is that after September 15,
2021, B.S.’s charges then went into a churn for an inordinately long period of
time, which on my assessment, Crown and defence counsel share equal
responsibility for.  Ultimately, trial dates were not set until over a year
later on November 1, 2022.  I will attribute the delay engendered between September
15, 2021 to November 1, 2022 (412 days) as 206 days of
defence caused delay
,
and 206 days as Crown caused delay.
84
.
I have already found that the period between
November 1, 2022, the set date for the trial, and November 23, 2023, the
anticipated end date for the trial, (i.e. 388 days) as a period
implicitly
waived or caused by the defence
, when the defence failed to raise any
complaint about the time it would take to conclude B.S.’s trial.
85
.
There was a further delay from November 23, 2023
to January 15, 2024 when the trial did not end on time as expected.  I will characterize
as Court delay the period of November 23 to December 20, 2023 (27 days).
86
.
The period of delay between December 20 and
January 15, 2024 (26 days) arose due to an exceptional circumstance.  Crown
counsel fell ill with Covid.
87
.
Accordingly, under my
Jordan
calculus,
without modification, total delay (sworn date of Info. No. 1, Mar. 5, 2021, to
actual end date of trial, January 15, 2024) amounts to 1046 days.
88
.
Total delay (1046 days) minus defence caused
delay (206 days), minus further delay implicitly waived or caused by the
defence (388 days), leaves a net delay of 352 days.
89
.
Net delay (352 days) minus exceptional circumstance/discrete
event delay (26 days) equates to 326 days.  Those 326 days is just under 11
months on B.S.’s first set of charges.  It does not exceed the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling for provincial court of 18 months.  His s. 11(b)
Charter
application must therefore fail.
Conclusion
90
.
For the reasons above stated, I must deny the
application brought on behalf of B.S. seeking the rare remedy of a stay of
proceedings.
91
.
I find his right under
s.11(b)
of the
Charter
to trial within a reasonable time has not been infringed or denied, when all
periods of delay are analyzed in accordance with the principles established in both
J.F.
and
Jordan.
