J.:
INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
The defendant is charged with sexual assault and forcible
confinement with respect to two young women.  A trial is scheduled before me in
February 2026.  The Defence brought a severance motion, seeking separate trials
with respect to each complainant. The Crown brought a
cross-count
similar fact evidence application
.
[
2
]
The Crown’s position is that the accused engaged in a pattern of
similar behaviour that confirms each complainant’s account of the events. The
Defence argues that the Crown cannot meet the test for admission of the
proposed evidence.  The parties agree that I should hear argument on the Crown
motion and that my ruling will determine the result in the Defence
severance motion. If the Crown motion succeeds, there will be one trial with
cross-count evidence.  If not, there will be two trials without cross-count
evidence.
[
3
]
I find that the Crown motion succeeds.
ANTICIPATED EVIDENCE
[
4
]
The two complainants are M.A. and K.B.  Both provided statements to
police, several months apart. There is no suggestion that M.A. and K.B. know
each other.
[
5
]
This is a summary of the allegations M.A. reported to the police:
1)
M.A. placed a
Snapchat story [a ride share procedure] requesting a ride for herself and her female
friend. M.A. and her friend are in school together and have known each other
since the age of 13.
2)
A man, unknown
to them, responded to this story indicating he could pick them up.
3)
M.A. provided a
description of this man.
4)
Instead of
transporting the two women to Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls, as requested, he
drove them to his home.
5)
At the home,
another male joined the group.
6)
M.A. consumed drinks
prepared by the man and became intoxicated.
7)
M.A. asked to go
to the bathroom but ended up in a bedroom. She remembers sitting on a bed and
having her pants removed by the man. She said “no”.
8)
Although M.A. has
no memory of this, she was later told by her female friend that after she found
herself in the bedroom with the man, the friend banged on the locked door and
tried unsuccessfully to gain entry to the bedroom.
9)
M.A’ s only
memory after having her clothes removed is arriving at her home. Within a day
or two of this incident, M.A. and the man exchanged Snapchat messages.  The man
told M.A. she had arrived home at 9:30 PM.  M.A. does not accept this as her
mother told her she had arrived home after her curfew.
10)
After arrival at home, M.A.
realized she had physical signs of sexually activity, went to the hospital, and
consented to a sexual assault kit.
[
6
]
This is a summary of the allegations K. B. reported to the police:
1)
K.B. went to a
bar and was introduced to “David”, a stranger, by the through a mutual male friend.
2)
K.B. and her
male friend went outside to smoke marijuana.  They were followed by the accused,
and all went to his motor vehicle.  K.B. felt comfortable doing so as she was
with a friend.  She did not realize that going for a smoke in this car would
mean leaving the area.
3)
David transported
the group to his home.  He gave them a tour of this home. During the tour the
three people went into a bedroom.  David told K.B.’s friend to go get
something.  David then locked the bedroom door.
4)
David told K.B.
to sit down and take off her clothes. Instead, she stood up but was pushed back
onto the bed.
5)
K.B. was
confused.  She said “no” and began to resist as David removed her clothes.
6)
K.B.’s male
friend tried unsuccessfully to gain entry to the bedroom
7)
David had sexual
intercourse with K.B.
8)
David
transported K.B. and her friend back to the bar.
9)
At the time of
these events, K.B. was 18 years old
10)
David looked to be in his early
thirties.
11)
K.B. provided a description of
David.  This description is like the one provided to the police by M.A. about
the man who responded to the share ride request.
[
7
]
As a result of swabbing M.A.’s internal and external vaginal, a DNA hit
matched the profile of the accused. Based on this test result, as well as other
evidence, the Crown alleges that the accused is the one who sexually assaulted
both complainants.
[

LEGAL PRINCIPLES
[
9
]
Evidence of prior or other bad conduct, or
criminal acts, by an accused is presumptively in admissible.  It can only be
admitted if it relates to an issue other than general disposition.  The onus is
on the Crown to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the probative
value of the evidence in relation to a particular issue outweighs its potential
prejudice and thereby justifies its reception. This is sometimes called similar
fact evidence.  This test applies where the similar fact evidence is
extrinsic (evidence that falls outside the counts before the court) or count to
count (evidence that is already admissible for specific counts but may be
relied upon, as similar fact evidence, in relation to other counts on a
multi-count indictment). The present motion deals with count to count.  If the
test is not met, evidence can only be used on the count to which it relates.
[
10
]
The leading case is
R. v. Handy
,
2002 SCC
56
.  The Supreme Court noted that the probative value of the similar
fact evidence arises because it supports double inferences; namely that the
accused has a particular propensity to engage certain conduct and that the
accused engaged in that very conduct in the alleged offence(s).  This evidence is
admissible because the force of similar circumstances defies coincidence or
other innocent explanation. The inferences sought must accord with common
sense, intuitive notions of probability and the unlikelihood of coincidence. Admissibility
is determined by a consideration of the relevance and probative value of the
evidence, the potential for “moral” or “reasoning” prejudice, and whether the
probative value outweighs the potentially prejudicial effects having regard to
all the circumstances. See: paragraphs 26-29, 42, 47.
[
11
]
In this assessment the purpose for which the evidence is being
proffered is critical.  The probative force of similar fact evidence is its
ability to advance or refute a particular issue at trial; that is, its
relevance. Whether a piece of evidence will be relevant depends upon the facts
alleged and the defences advanced or reasonably anticipated. Probative value,
like relevance, cannot be assessed in the abstract. See:
Handy
at
paragraphs
69-70, 73-74
and
R. v. MacDonald
,
2017 ONCA 568
at paragraphs
66
, 80
[
12
]
The connectedness or nexus between the similar act(s) and the
conduct for which the accused stands charged is central to the analysis.  At
paragraph 82 in
Handy
the Supreme Court referred to the following
factors:
1)
The nature and
strength of the similar fact evidence;
2)
Proximity in
time of the similar acts (a greater lapse of time tends to undermine the
premise of continuity of character or disposition; remoteness in time may also
affect relevance and reliability);
3)
Extent to which
the other acts are similar to the complainant’s allegations;
4)
The objective improbability of coincidence;
5)
Number of occurrences of the similar acts;
6)
Circumstances surrounding or relating to the similar acts;
7)
Any distinctive features unifying the incidents;
8)
Intervening events;
9)
The relative importance of the issue to which the evidence relates; and
10)
Any other factors which would tend to support or rebut the underlying
unity of the similar acts.
[
13
]
The analysis must also consider dissimilarities between the acts.
This is not a counting exercise. Rather, it is an assessment of the persuasive
degree of connection between the similar fact evidence and the offence charged.
See
Handy
at paragraph
123
[
14
]
Prejudice refers to impermissible reasoning. The dangers have
been framed this way: Moral prejudice – The risk that the trier will engage in
the forbidden chain of reasoning, relying on the accused’s general disposition
or bad character to support an inference of guilt – and Reasoning prejudice – the
risk that the trier of fact will be confused, or distracted, by the
multiplicity of incidents. See:
Handy
at paragraphs
31, 56, 71, 100, 139
and
MacDonald
at paragraph
83
.
SUBMISSIONS
[
15
]
In written submissions, the Crown argues that
the similar fact evidence is relevant to these issues:
1)
To
prove the
actus reus
occurred, including through a pattern of behaviour
on the part of the accused based on
R. v. Handy
’s “double inferences” or
through motive:
R. v. T.C.
,
2005 CanLII 371 (ON CA)
, [2005] O.J. No. 24 (C.A.);
R. v. Finelli
,
[2008] O.J. No. 2242 (S.C.J.)
;
R. v. Morin
,
[2005] O.J. No. 4402 (C.A.)
;
R. v. S.C.
,
2018 ONCA 454
;
R. v. C.K.C.
,
2008 ONCJ 513
;
R. v.
Brown
,
[2006] O.J. No. 5276 (C.A.)
;
R. v. P.S
.,
2007 ONCA 299
;
R.
v. D.S.F
.,
1999 CanLII 3704 (ON CA)
, [1999] O.J. No. 688 (C.A.).
2)
To
prove the accused had the requisite
mens rea
, including through proof of
motive and/or animus towards the complainant:
R. v. C.K.C
.,
2008 ONCJ
513
;
R. v. Stubbs
,
2013 ONCA 514
;
R. v. Carroll
,
2014 ONCA 2
;
R.
v. Moo
,
2009 ONCA 645
.
3)
To
negate the defence of innocent association or accident. When the accused admits
that the alleged act occurred but claims that he acted with innocent intent,
evidence that other persons allege similar impropriety may be admissible to
rebut that position, based on
R. v. Handy
’s “double inferences”:
R.
v. F.F.B.,
1993 CanLII 167 (SCC)
, [1993] S.C.J. No. 21;
R. v. Moore
,
1994 CanLII 8730 (ON CA)
, [1994] O.J. No. 1685
(C.A.);
R. v. MacDonald
,
2017 ONCA 568
;
R. v. W.S.,
2004 CanLII 33348 (ON CA)
, [2004] O.J.
No. 4164 (C.A.);
R. v. Brown
,
[2006] O.J. No. 5276 (C.A.)
.
4)
To
rebut recent fabrication or implausibility of acts. Where the defence points to
a triggering event to say that the complainant fabricated the complaint (in
response to that event), similar fact evidence (of similar conduct by the
accused toward the same complainant) may be admitted in order to refute this
claim. Similarly, where the defence attacks the credibility of the complainants
on the basis that the allegations are implausible (e.g. that the accused would
never commit these offences in circumstances where people were nearby), other
discreditable conduct may be relied on to dispute this (e.g. by showing that he
routinely exposed himself in circumstances where others may have seen him):
R.
v. G.R.,
[1993] O.J. No. 600 (C.A.)
;
R. v. C.J.P
.,
[2004] O.J. No.
1531 (C.A.)
.
[
16
]
The Defence points out that probative
value goes to proof of an issue; prejudice goes to fairness of the trial. Where
probative value proceeds, prejudice does not recede.  Counsel brought several
decisions to my attention in support of the argument that the Crown motion
should fail.  The Defence position is this: The link between
the proposed similar fact evidence is weak.  Moreover, while this evidence may
be probative but it does not establish a unique pattern.  It is generic.  The only
inference is one of general disposition.  There is a danger of moral and
reasoning prejudice.
ANALYSIS
[
17
]
The DNA results leaves little doubt that sexual
activity occurred between the accused and one of the complainants.  The Crown has
persuaded me that the proposed similar fact evidence reveals distinctive
features that demonstrate a common pattern, making coincidence objectively improbable.
There is no risk of collusion.
The evidence is
relevant to the issues of identity, consent,
actus reus
and
mens rea.
Concerns about prejudice relate to impermissible reasoning and trial
distraction. In judge-alone trials, these risks are reduced.  In any event, the
proposed evidence is more probative than prejudicial.
[
18
]
In coming to my conclusion, I note that the following
similarities and unique features in the proposed evidence can support these
inferences:
1)
The accused, a man in his early thirties, is a stranger to the complainants.
2)
The complainants were both young women at time: K.B. was 18 years
old.  M.A. was in school and subject to a parental curfew.
3)
The accused transported the complainants to his home under false
pretences (a ride share to Niagara Falls/smoking marihuana in his motor vehicle).
4)
The accused also brought a friend of each complainant to his home.
This gave comfort to the complainants.
5)
Once in the home, the accused isolated the complainants in a
bedroom.
6)
The respective friends of the complainants were unsuccessful in
rescuing them because the accused had locked the door.
7)
The accused removed the complainant’s clothing and engaged in sexual
activity with them.
8)
After the sexual activity the accused transported the parties back
to the place where he had first met the complainants.
[
19
]
There are dissimilarities to consider.  The
method of contact is not the same; snapchat vs meeting in a bar.  More
significant is that there is a gap in time between the allegations; March 2022
with respect to K.B. and May 2024 in the case of M.A.  These considerations do
not undermine the nature of the evidence that may prove a core pattern of
opportunistic isolation and sexual assault.
RESULT
[
20
]
The motion by the Crown with respect to
cross-count similar fact evidence is allowed. The severance motion is
dismissed.  There will be one trial with respect to both complainants.
[
21
]
I close on an obvious point:  I have found that
the similar fact evidence is relevant to the issues of identity, consent,
actus
reus
and
mens rea.
It does not follow that this evidence is
dispositive of those issues.  That decision is the subject of a nine-day trial
at which the Crown carries a greater burden of proof.
