J.:
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
1.0:  INTRODUCTION
[
1
.]
On May 5,
2025, the Offender, Maxwell Carveth, entered pleas of guilty to two offences:  making
child pornography available and possession of child pornography, contrary to sections
161.1(3) and 161.1(4) of the
Criminal Code
.
[
2
.]
On
September 8, 2025, a sentencing hearing took place.  The Crown seeks a concurrent
term of imprisonment of 18 months followed by probation and several ancillary
orders.  The offender urges that a Conditional Sentence Order (CSO) is
reasonable together with some, but not all, of the ancillary orders sought by
the prosecution.
[
3
.]
What
follows are my reasons for sentence.
2.0: 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES
[
4
.]
Between
December 27 and 28, 2022 the offender uploaded 59 files (images and videos) of
child pornography to a chat platform called KIK .  The files exploited infants
and girls under 13 years of age.  Most of the files depicted female children masturbating
or otherwise engaged in acts of digital, vaginal, and anal penetration by
adults.  Others showed children performing cunnilingus of other children as
well as performing fellatio on men.
[
5
.]
In February
2023, the police seized three devices from the offender and searched them.  24
videos and 50 images of child pornography were seized and categorized.  The
police also found 24 other videos and 19 other images that were identified as
images of child nudity, or images of individuals whose ages could not be
ascertained with accuracy.
3.0:  CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER
[
6
.]
The
offender was born on July 15, 1994, making him 28 years of age at the time of
the offences.  At the time of sentencing, he was 31 years old.
[
7
.]
He has no
prior criminal record.
[
8
.]
Upon
arrest, the offender was held for bail.  He was released on bail on conditions,
none which were onerous or interfered with his day to day living or work.  The
offender has been fully compliant with his bail order for over 24 months prior
to sentencing.
[
9
.]
The
offender lives with his parents who have always attended court with him.  He
had a healthy and positive childhood.  He enjoys very strong support from his
family and friends.
[
10
.]
While the
offender has enjoyed a supportive family, he experienced bullying and prejudice
in high school for being gay, resulting in considerable anguish.
[
11
.]
The
offender has completed two-years of college education and, until these charges,
worked full time as a cook.
[
12
.]
The
offender does not suffer from any addictions or substance abuse.
[
13
.]
Until
this incident, the offender could fairly be described as a model citizen.
[
14
.]
Upon his
arrest, the offender was fully cooperative with police.  He spoke candidly to Leanna
Esposito, the probation officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report, and to Dr.
Tania Stirpe, a forensic psychologist, who prepared an Assessment Report.  Both
documents were filed at the time of sentencing.  Each report states that the
offender is genuinely remorseful and has real insight into the harm caused by
his crimes.  At no time did he try to justify or minimize his behaviour to
either author.
[
15
.]
The
offender’s motive for sharing these materials was to attract attention of other
men on KIK as potential sexual partners by impressing them with these images
because other users had posted similar materials.
[
16
.]
He
stressed that he was, and is, not sexually attracted to children.  This
assertion was confirmed by Dr. Stirpe after conducting a wide range of tests
and assessments.  Dr. Stirpe opined that the offender is a low risk to reoffend
sexually, nor does he demonstrate antisocial tendencies or negative attitudes.
[
17
.]
The
offender has expressed willingness to participate in counselling to address the
factors that led him to commit these crimes.  Dr. Stirpe believed that Mr.
Carveth’s prospects for rehabilitation are very good.
4.0:  MITIGATING, AGGRAVATING, AND OTHER
RELEVANT FACTORS
4.1:  Mitigating Factors
[
18
.]
The
following mitigating factors are present in this case:
(a)
There
were pleas of guilty in the face of triable issues;
(b)
The
offender was fully cooperative with investigators;
(c)
He has no
prior criminal record;
(d)
The
offender demonstrated genuine remorse;
(e)
He has
real insight into the harm he caused by these crimes;
(f)
The
offences took place over a very short period, being hours;
(g)
He was
motivated by a misguided means of attracting a sexual partner online and not
for prurient reasons;
(h)
There was
no effort to monetize the child pornography;
(i)
He did
not create any of the images;
(j)
The
offender is neither a pedophile nor predatory;
(k)
He is at
a low risk of recidivism;
(l)
He was
fully compliant with his modest bail for nearly two years;
(m)
The offender is employable; and
(n)
The
offender is amenable to rehabilitation which has reasonable prospects of
success.
4.2:  Aggravating Factors
[
19
.]
There
several aggravating factors including:
(a)
There
were 74 images and videos seized. One is too many;
(b)
The
nature of the shared images is sickening with a maximum level of intrusiveness
and depravity;
(c)
The
collection involves numerous children of varying ages, including infants;
(d)
The
offender treated victimized children as objects and chattel without care for
their dignity;
(e)
While he did
not create or monetize the images, the offender intentionally sought out,
obtained, stored, then freely shared images of significant sexual violence
towards the most vulnerable members of society to use them as a means to
attract a partner.  Consequently, his motivation was calculated and callous;
(f)
The
nature of the offences is grave; and
(g)
His moral
responsibility could not be higher.
4.3:  Other Relevant Sentencing Factors
[
20
.]
The
offender was arrested on August 25, 2023, and released on bail that day.  None
of the bail conditions were unduly restrictive by nature given the offences and
there is no suggestion that any of the bail conditions materially interfered
with his liberty interests.
[
21
.]
The
offender does not suffer from any significant physical or mental health issues,
nor did he at the time of the offences.
5.0:  APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES
[
22
.]
The Ontario Court of
Appeal
in
R. v. Pike
,
2024 ONCA 608
,
at para.
7
, emphasized the child-centered approach to sentencing that must
be taken in child pornography cases post-
Friesen
(in reference
to
R. v. Friesen
,
2020 SCC 9
):
A child-centered approach to
sentencing requires judges to consider child victims and the wrongs and harms
that people who possess child pornography inflict on them, to reject myths that
minimize the perpetrator’s responsibility and, finally, to apply a denunciatory
sentencing range that reflects the abhorrent and harmful nature of these
offences and their long-term negative impacts on children.
[
23
.]
Denunciation and
deterrence must be prioritized:
R. v. Inksetter
,
2018
ONCA 474
;
Pike
at para.
159
; s. 718.01 CCC.
[
24
.]
R. v. Friesen
states
that penitentiary sentences for
sex crimes against children should be the norm.  Conditional sentences for
sexual offences against children will only rarely be appropriate:
R. v.
Doucette
,
2021 ONSC 371
at para.
53
. Their availability must be
limited to exceptional circumstances that render incarceration inappropriate:
R.
v. M.M
.,
2022 ONCA 441
at para
16
;
R. v. B.M.
2023 ONCA 224
;
Pike
, supra at para
179 to 182
;
R. v. Henry
,
2024 ONCA 797
at para.
29 to 30
;
R. v. A.L.,
2025 ONCA 9
at para.
16 to
21
.
[
25
.]
The phrase “exceptional circumstances”
is shorthand for personal circumstances and mitigating factors that are
sufficiently compelling to make a conditional sentence proportionate:
Pike
at para.
182
. Multiple seemingly non-exceptional factors taken together
can collectively render a conditional sentence proportionate:
Pike
,
at para.
182
. Some exceptional circumstances include medical hardship
that could not adequately be addressed within the correctional facility (
M.M.
,
supra), age or other infirmity, or a causally connected mental or developmental
condition that can reduce the offender’s moral blameworthiness (
R. v. Rytel
,
2019 ONSC 5541
;
R. v. Fulford
,
2024 ONSC 4901
).
6.0:  PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO THIS CASE
[
26
.]
Both
parties submit that a sentence of under two years is appropriate.  I agree.
Consequently, a conditional sentence is legally available in this case.
[
27
.]
In this case, the
collection of child pornography possessed by the offender is modest in
comparison with others; however, the contents of the collection are evil. 
His offences involve a single day, yet the offender was organized and
persistent.  His offences were deliberate and considered.  They
constitute a callous disregard for the harm being caused to children that must
be denounced in the clearest of terms.
[
28
.]
The
offender’s contrition, low risk of recidivism, and his excellent prospects for
rehabilitation are significant mitigating factors.  However, when assessing the
case as a whole, these factors speak less to whether a conditional sentence is
appropriate than to the length of the sentence.  Put differently,
notwithstanding the able submissions on behalf of Mr. Carveth, this is not an
exceptional case sufficiently compelling to justify a conditional sentence. 
However, these factors do make a sentence of 18 months reasonable.
[
29
.]
Mr.
Carveth made a conscious and considered decision to access, select then share
these images.  He went for the worst possible sort of exploitation for his own
selfish purpose.  Even when he committed these crimes, he understood the
wrongful and harmful nature of his actions yet followed through, thereby
showing a shocking indifference to the victims’ suffering.  I agree with the
submission of Crown counsel that cases like this are a vivid illustration of
the corrosive and radioactive impact on the victims and society alike, in that
these images last forever and are repeatedly used to unravel the fabric of
safety for all children.
[
30
.]
Considering
the matrix of multiple
mitigating, aggravating, and other relevant factors present in this case
collectively, I find that a conditional sentence would be inconsistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing including the overarching need
to denounce and deter his ghastly crime.
[
31
.]
It was
submitted on behalf of the offender that a s.161 order was not necessary given
his low risk of recidivism and lack of pedophilic tendencies.  With respect, I
disagree.  It is clear that this offender was ready and willing to exploit
children for his own pleasure on one occasion and society must be safe from any
urges, how low the risk, he may have in the future to commit other crimes against
children.
7.0:  CONCLUSION
[
32
.]
Convictions
are entered on both counts.  I make the following sentence on the 161.1(4)
offence and concurrent on the 161.1(3) offence:
(a)
18 months
jail;
(b)
Probation
for two years including, inter alia, reporting and counselling for sexual
offending behaviour.  The report of Dr. Stirpe will be provided to the
probation services to assist in the offender’s supervision and rehabilitation;
(c)
A s. 109
firearms prohibition;
(d)
A SOIRA
Order.  Counsel will assist me in applying the correct reporting period;
(e)
A s. 161
Order for ten years including restrictions on internet use involving children
and pornography; and
(f)
I will
waive the victim surcharges given the offender’s lack of financial resources at
this time.
