OVERVIEW
[
1
]
As I and other judges in this
jurisdiction have noted in previous decisions, auto theft
has
become
an
epidemic
in Halton
Region.
One
need
only
speak
to
their
neighbour or turn on their radio to hear
anecdotes of the steep rise in this type of
crime
in the past couple
of
years.
While
many
of
these thefts
occur under the cover of
darkness,
with the assailants
never
encountering the vehicle's
owner, thieves
are becoming
bolder,
robbing the victims of their possessions and vehicles in broad daylight.
Mr. Mesquita and his colleagues were some
of these more brazen thieves.
[
2
]
On April 5, 2024,
after I presided over a Preliminary Inquiry in this matter, Mr. Mesquita
re-elected
to have his trial held before
me and then pled
guilty to
one count of robbing Bhavna Thakersee of her motor vehicle on May 27, 2022 and
robbing Jill MacKenzie of her motor vehicle
on May 30,
2022.
[
3
]
While I heard a significant amount
of evidence sitting as the Preliminary Inquiry Justice,
Mr. Mesquita admitted specific facts for the purposes of his
plea.
Those facts are contained in an
Agreed Statement of Fact, filed as Exhibit 1 on this guilty
plea.
[
4
]
As part of the guilty plea, Mr.
Mesquita called evidence on the sentencing.
The
purpose of this evidence was to outline an alleged breach of his
Charter
rights
and improper conduct on the part of the police during a separate incident.
The specifics of this allegation will be
discussed in more detail later.
FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
[
5
]
Mr.
Mesquita
admitted,
through
the
Agreed
Statement of
Fact,
that
he
perpetrated
a
series
of
robberies and
attempted robberies between May
27
,
2022 and
June
6,
2022. He carried out these robberies with
at least three other individuals. These parties had discussed, contemplated,
and ultimately agreed to pursue this common unlawful objective, bringing a
criminal conspiracy into being. The criminal conspiracy persisted until
police intervened and
arrested the
accused alongside two
of
his
co-conspirators
on June 6
,
2022
.
[
6
]
One of the specific
robberies to which Mr. Mesquita pled
guilty
was on May 27,
2022
.
On this
day, Ms. Bhavna Thakersee drove her Range Rover to a shopping centre at 2091
,
Winston Park Drive in Oakville
,
where she was meeting a friend for
lunch. The accused and several other assailants
,
including a Mr
.
Layne
,
a Mr.
Johnson and a Mr. Francois, arrived at
the
same
plaza
in
Mr.
Mesquita's blue
Honda
Civic
around
this
time
.
They stopped near Ms. Thakersee
'
s
parked vehicle and waited.
[
7
]
At approximately
4:30 PM
,
Ms
.
Thakersee returned to her vehicle and opened the rear driver
'
s side door to put her purse down. The assailants pulled forward
in their blue Honda Civic, blocking the Range Rover
'
s escape.
[
8
]
One
assailant
(not
Mr
.
Mesquita)
approached
Ms.
Thakersee
from
behind
and
held
her
by
the shoulders or upper arms
.
A second assailant
approached her after she began screaming and told her to be quiet, saying that
he had a knife. A third assailant began going through Ms.
Thakersee's purse
for her
car
keys. When
the
keys were
located, one of
the
assailants pushed
Ms.
Thakersee
to
the
side
before
the
group
fled
the
scene
in
Mr
.
Mesquita
'
s blue Honda Civic and the Range Rover
.
[
9
]
The
force
applied
upon
Ms.
Thakersee
was
minimal,
in
that
she
suffered
no physical
injuries
as
a
result
of
the
incident.
No
weapon was
actually observed during
the robbery
.
Mr
.
Mesquita
remained in the blue Honda Civic throughout the incident and acted as the
getaway driver
.
[
10
]
The second robbery
that Mr. Mesquita pled guilty to was on May 30, 2022, 3 days after the robbery
of Ms. Thakersee. On this occasion, Ms. MacKenzie drove her Range Rover to the
Dorval Centre at 200 North Service Road in Oakville, where she parked and went
about some errands. Mr. Mesquita and several other assailants arrived at the
same plaza, again in his blue Honda Civic, and stopped behind Ms. MacKenzie's
parked Range Rover and waited.
[
11
]
Ms
.
MacKenzie
returned
to
her
vehicle
at
approximately
3:40
pm.
As
she
was
about
to
get
into
her
vehicle,
the
assailants
pulled
forward
in
the
blue
Honda
Civic
,
blocking
the
Range
Rover's
ability
to
leave
.
One
of
the
assailants
pushed
Ms.
MacKenzie from
behind
and
demanded
her
car
keys.
She
quickly
surrendered
her
keys
to
that
person
and ran to a nearby store.
The
assailants then fled the scene in Mr
.
Mesquita
'
s blue Honda Civic and the stolen Range Rover.
Ms. MacKenzie did not suffer any physical
injuries as a result of the force applied to her
.
[
12
]
As
mentioned
,
Mr
.
Mesquita
was
ultimately
arrested
on
June
6
,
2022
.
In
the Agreed
Statement of Fact
,
Mr
.
Mesquita admitted that he and two of
his co-conspirators planned to
attempt another carjacking
.
One of the assailants drove the aforementioned
blue Honda Civic to the Fairview Mall in Toronto. They parked the vehicle near
an unoccupied Range Rover and waited for the driver to return, whereupon the
robbery would be attempted in much the same manner as the earlier incidents.
The accused parties waited for a time, but left before the driver returned
.
[
13
]
The three men then drove the blue Honda
Civic to the Sherway Gardens Mall in Etobicoke
.
They
again
parked
near
an
unoccupied Range
Rover
and
waited
for
the
driver to return, whereupon the robbery would be attempted
.
Unbeknownst to any of the assailants, the police had been
tracking their Honda Civic via tracking devices and a police
helicopter and
had
been
following
the
vehicle
for
some
time.
Mr.
Mesquita
and
his two
co-accused were
placed under arrest
before
the
driver
of
the
Range
Rover
returned.
POSITIONS
ON
SENTENCE
[
14
]
The
Crown suggests that a sentence of 27 months (or 2 years and 3
months) is appropriate
.
They also request a
section 109
of
the
Criminal
Code
weapons prohibition order for life
,
and that a sample of Mr
.
Mesquita's DNA be taken
.
They furthermore request an order pursuant to
section 743.21
of the
Criminal Code
,
prohibiting Mr. Mesquita from
communicating with
a
number of
people, including his co-accused, while in custody.
[
15
]
Defence counsel suggests that a
conditional sentence, allowing Mr. Mesquita to
serve his sentence in the community under strict conditions, would
adequately address the principles
of
sentencing
in
this
case
.
They
take
no
issue
with
the
ancillary
orders being sought by the Crown.
[
16
]
Section
344(1)(b) is
an
indictable offence
,
and
punishable
to
imprisonment
for
life.
There is no mandatory minimum for this
offence, and therefore the conditional sentence provisions of the
Criminal
Code
are available to Mr
.
Mesquita, if in fact I decide the fit sentence is less than two
years and otherwise appropriate.
IMPACT
OF
THE
OFFENCE
ON
THE
COMPLAINANT
[
17
]
A
Victim
Impact Statement was
prepared by
Ms. Thakersee for
the
sentencing of Mr
.
Layne, one of the co
-
accused who
pled guilty before me on an earlier date.
Her
statement, however, applies to all of the assailants who robbed her that day.
In it, she describes the considerable
amount of mental and emotional stress that Mr. Mesquita's actions
,
and
the
actions
of
his
co-accused
,
caused
her.
To
her
credit
,
she
also
states
the
following:
I do
hope that, in
the future, he makes
better choices, including about the company he
keeps
.
He should know that he
is
better
than
this
and should strive to live up to his true potential
,
without letting himself and his family down
again.
I
would
like
him
to
know
that
as
a
young
man
he
has
his
whole life ahead of him
-
he
should live it
with integrity
,
principle
and dignity
.
He
should use this experience to transform his life into one
he and his family can be proud of.
[
18
]
This is a remarkably optimistic
statement from a victim of a terrifying crime.
I am sure other members of
our
community would not
be
so positive and forgiving.
[
19
]
Ms
.
MacKenzie
did
not
provide any
input
about her
experience
.
[
20
]
Ms. Thakersee
'
s encouraging comments aside, it must be remembered what Mr.
Mesquita
did.
In
broad daylight
,
he
and
his
accomplices swarmed innocent
members of our community and took their vehicles by force.
One need not have a Victim Impact Statement
to come to the commonsense conclusion of how terrifying that must have been
.
[
21
]
As mentioned at the outset
,
thefts of automobiles
are all too
common in our community now
.
As
Justice
Latimer of
our
jurisdiction
noted
in
the
very
recent
case
of
R
.
v
.
Casseus
,
2024 ONCJ
654
at
paragraph
6
:
Auto
theft
cases
are
flowing
into
our
criminal
courts
at
a
concerning
rate.
In 2019, 494 cars were reported
stolen in this region
.
In 2023
,
that number rose to
1379
.
That is
an
increase of
over 179% in
two
years
.
In 2023
,
two
vehicles were stolen
for
every 1000
citizens in
our
community.
Further, as [the Crown] acknowledged in submissions, these
numbers may not even include circumstances like the present case
,
where an
unsuccessful attempt was made to steal a vehicle
.
[
22
]
The
Crown
did
not
file
the
same
evidence
about
car
theft
in
Mr
.
Mesquita's case as
they
did
in
Casseus
,
but
even
without those
statistics
,
there
is
no
denying
that
car
theft has
increased
at
a
startling rate
in
Halton
and
has
become a
serious
stress and
concern for its citizens.
PERSONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
THE
OFFENDER
[
23
]
A Pre-Sentence
Report ("PSR
"
) was prepared
.
It paints a fuller picture of Mr
.
Mesquita's background
,
educat
i
on
and personal relationships.
To be
frank, it is one of the
more
positive
PSRs
I
have
seen.
He
described
a
happy
and
normal
childhood
,
devoid of any abuse
,
with a loving mother who provided for him emotionally
,
spiritually and financially.
He
does
not
know his
father
,
but
has
other family members who helped
raise him.
[
24
]
He is also in a
committed relationship with his girlfriend
.
Mr.
Mesquita
himself
is
now
a
father.
He
has
a
6-month
-
old
daughter
that
he
wishes to
help raise
.
He
graduated
high school and
has
completed a
Home Renovation course through York Construction Academy.
[
25
]
There were also letters of support
.
They are
,
frankly
,
heartbreaking.
His
mother has been deeply affected and let down by her son
'
s conduct.
As has his
aunt
,
who while acknowledging the seriousness of his crimes, begs the
court for mercy.
His girlfriend wants
very
much
for
Mr.
Mesquita
to
be
present
in
her
children's
lives
.
He
is
the
biological
father to
her youngest
,
but he
takes on a parental role for her other children as well.
[
26
]
In
the
end, I
am
left
confused as
to
why someone, with such
a
positive
upbringing and
strong
social
circle
would
commit
such
terrorizing
crimes.
He
definitely appears
to
be
an
intelligent
,
caring
,
talented
and
driven
individual
with
a
lot
of
opportunities
and
support
,
but
at
the
same
time,
appears to
be
an
individual
who
threw
those
opportunities
and
hard work away to participate in
these robberies
.
PRINCIPLES
OF
SENTENCING
AND
ANALYSIS
[
27
]
I
must
consider
what
constitutes
a
proportionate
sentence
in
these
circumstances,
having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing
outlined in
section 718
of the
Criminal Code
and in the case law.
[
28
]
As
,
both counsel pointed out, denunciation
and deterrence are the primary considerations when sentencing individuals found
guilty of robbery.
This was also
recently
reiterated by our Court of
Appeal
in
R
.
v
.
Hanna,
2024
ONCA 911
at paragraph
6
.
[
29
]
Courts
have
very
few
options
other
than
imprisonment
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
denunciation
and
deterrence
-
see
for
example
our
Court
of
Appeal
in
R
.
v. lnksetter,
2018 ONCA 474
at
paragraph
17
and
the
case of
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC
64
at
paragraph
6
, where the Supreme Court of Canada stated
:
While it is normal for trial judges to consider sentences
other than imprisonment in appropriate cases
,
in the instant case
,
as in all cases in
which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized, the
courts
have
very
few
options
other
than
imprisonment for meeting these objectives
,
which are
essential
to
the
maintenance of
a
just, peaceful and
law-abiding society.
[
30
]
Lacasse
was
an
impaired
driving
causing
death
case
,
but
its
comments
with respect to jail being necessary to address denunciation and
deterrence are equally applicable to any case where those factors are the
primary considerations.
[
31
]
I want to be clear that I am cognizant
of the fact that a conditional sentence, as requested
by
Mr
.
Mesquita,
is
considered
a
jail
sentence
,
and
as
outlined
by
the
Supreme Court
of
Canada in
R
.
v. Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5
can
,
in
the
right
circumstances
,
address
the principles of sentencing contained in the
Criminal Code
,
including
denunciat
i
on and
deterrence
.
[
32
]
Section 718
.
2 of the
Criminal
Code
provides
other sentencing
principles
I must consider
.
While
that
section
emphasizes that
an
offender should
not
be
deprived
of
their liberty when less
restrictive sanctions may be appropriate, it also states that sentences must be
consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community
.
[
33
]
Furthermore
,
section
718
.
2(b)
states
that
"
a
sentence
should
be
similar
to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed
in similar circumstances".
In
this regard
,
it is important to remember that Mr
.
Layne and Mr. Johnson
,
both of
whom were involved in the same robberies, were given significant penitentiary
sentences.
Mr.
Layne
received a
4-year sentence
,
although he
pled
gu
i
lty
to more
charges
in
this
case,
and
additional
charges
from
another jurisdiction
.
Mr
.
Johnson pled
guilty to
3
counts in
this case, and
received
a
3
1/2 year sentence for his
role
in
the robberies.
A significant difference between these
three offenders is
that Mr. Layne
and Mr. Johnson both
had
prior criminal records, so unlike Mr
.
Mesquita
,
it
was
not
their first encounter with the
criminal justice system.
[
34
]
Mr
.
Francois
,
the third assailant in this case, did not have a criminal
record, and his circumstances are more similar to those of Mr
.
Mesquita
.
After careful cons
i
deration of Mr. Francois
'
personal
circumstances
,
I found that a 2 ½ year sentence
was
appropriate.
[
35
]
Although
parity
of
sentence
(as
outlined in
section 718.2(b) above) is
appropriate
,
sentencing
must always remain an individual process whi
c
h requires
flexibility in the application of
all
the
principles
of
sentencing to
the
relevant
factors related to
the
offence and the offender
.
[
36
]
The
seriousness
of
Mr.
Mesquita
'
s
offences cannot
be
disputed.
He
and
his colleagues essentially swarmed
innocent
members of
our
community in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
While
it
was
not
Mr
.
Mesquita
who
laid
hands
on
Ms
.
Thakersee
and
Ms
.
MacKenzie
,
he
was a willing party to
both
robberies
and is no less culpable for
the
trauma the group inflicted on
these victims
.
Ms
.
Thakersee was held briefly
,
told that the assailants had a knife
,
and her vehicle was then taken and never recovered.
Ms. MacKenzie
'
s Range Rover was similarly never recovered
.
[
37
]
It is not as though Mr. Mesquita
'
s participation in these crimes was a "one-off
'
endeavour.
He carried
out these robberies with at least three other individuals and as agreed to in
the Statement of Facts
,
these parties had discussed,
contemplated, and ultimately agreed to pursue this common unlawful objective
.
While the victims were random
,
the crime – robbing somebody of thei
r
high-end vehicle – was very much premeditated.
Mr
.
Mesquita
drove
the
getaway car
on
the
first
occasion
,
and
then
3
days
later
,
committed the exact same offence.
A week later
,
he was set up again, ready to commit a third robbery
.
[
38
]
In
short
,
Mr. Mesquita was part of a
group of
men
that
were on
a
terrorizing
crime
spree in
the Greater Toronto
Area in the spring of 2022.
[
39
]
Robbery
carries
with
it
the
potential
of
a
life
sentence
for
a
reason.
As
our Supreme Court of Canada
recently
held in
R. v
.
Hilbach
,
2023 SCC 3
at paragraph
53
,
"even
when
committed
without
a
firearm
,
robbery
is
a
serious
offence
based
on
the
requisite
actus reus
of the use or threat of violence or force in stealing or attempting
to steal property."
[
40
]
Justice Latimer
,
now a judge of our Superior Court
,
but in 2024 sitting on this court in
Halton
aptly
described the
seriousness
of
car jacking cases
in
R.
v.
Dhillon
,
2024
ONCJ
284
at paragraph
18
:
The
gravity
of
these
crimes
is
enormous.
Our

are
safe
havens
for citizens
when
out
and
about
in
the
community
.
Mr
.
Dhillon
stole
that
feeling
of safety
from these
individuals
.
He did so brazenly
and
in
public
,
and in taking their vehicles at gunpoint
,
made these citizens fear for their lives
.
[
41
]
Dhillon
involved
an imitation firearm, which is why Mr
.
Dhillon, a first-time adult offender
,
received
a
5-year
sentence
in
that
case.

Latimer's comments about
the seriousness of the car jacking
robberies, however, applies to Mr
.
Mesquita's crimes as
well.
The lack of a firearm being
used in the robberies certainly distinguishes Mr. Mesquita's
case
from
that
of
Mr.
Dhillon
'
s,
but
the
robberies
in
the
case
at
bar
nonetheless
remain terrifying
.
Innocent members of our
community
,
who were
simply going about their
day
,
shopping, having
lunch
with
friends
or
travelling
to
and
from
work
should
not
be subjected
to
the
type
of
terror
Mr.
Mesquita
and
his
accomplices inflicted
upon
the
victims in this case
.
[
42
]
All
this being said, this case is not without its mitigating circumstances.
First and foremost, in
my view,
Mr
.
Mesquita pled
guilty
.
It
was
not an
early guilty plea, and came
at the end of a lengthy Preliminary Inquiry where I found
that the matter should be committed to
stand
trial
in
the
Superior Court of
Justice
.
All
parties, however, re-elected before the
formal committal to
stand trial so
they could plead guilty before me
.
The trial in this matter would have been complex, in my
view
,
and
while it was a strong Crown case involving cell
phone data,
tracking
devices and video surveillance, there
is
never a guarantee that a finding of guilt
will occur after trial.
Mr
.
Mesquita
,
by pleading guilty, relieved
the
Crown of
that
heavy
burden,
accepted responsibility,
and
that
is
a
significant
sign of remorse.
[
43
]
I
find
that
Mr. Mesquita was at
the
bottom
of
the
hierarchy in
these
robberies
.
He was the
driver of
the getaway car
,
and never had any interaction with the
victims.
I was told in submissions
,
and it was not contested by the Crown, that Mr. Mesquita felt
threatened by his co-conspirators and immediately confessed to the police upon
his arrest.
While
being the
driver of
the
getaway car
certainly
makes him
a
party
to
this
very serious offence, his role and to a
lesser extent, moral culpability
,
is less than that of his
associates
.
[
44
]
Mr.
Mesquita
is
also
a
first
time
,
youthful
offender
.
His
PSR
and
letters
of
reference
that I reviewed earlier present an intelligent and hard working young man who
completed school
and
is
now
pursuing
a
career
in
home
renovations.
He
also
has
significant
support from his family, and in
particular his girlfriend
,
with whom he now has a child
.
THE
SUBSEQUENT
ARREST
OF
MR.
MESQUITA:
[
45
]
I
will now turn to counsel's argument with respect to Mr
.
Mesquita's subsequent
arrest while
he
was
on
bail,
and
what
effect
,
if
any,
it
may
have
on
the
appropriate
sentence.
[
46
]
The
circumstances
surrounding Mr.
Mesquita
'
s arrest while he was
on bail can be summarized as follows
.
[
47
]
When released on
bail for his robbery offences, one of the conditions that he was to abide by
was to "reside with your surety at […]
Crescent,
North York
,
ON
each
and
every
night'
.
On
January
29,
2023,
police
attended
at
the
named
address
around 10 pm and Mr.
Mesquita was not there.
Around 11:30
pm,
Mr. Mesquita pulled into the
driveway and was arrested for breaching the above condition.
He was held in custody until
the next morning, when the
Crown exercised their discretion and
withdrew the charges.
[
48
]
The officers explained
that their interpretation of the bail
condition
was that Mr.
Mesquita was to be home each and every night -
"Night"
being defined in the
Criminal Code
as
"the
period
between
nine
o'clock in
the
afternoon and
six
o'clock
in
the
forenoon of the following day".
He was therefore, in
their
view, breaching this condition when he was not home until 11:30 pm
.
[
49
]
When
he was arrested
,
the police did a
cursory search of a backpack that was
within
reach
of Mr. Mesquita in the
back seat of his car
.
Nothing was located.
[
50
]
One
junior
officer,
though
I
did
not
hear
from
him,
apparently
questioned
the authority to
arrest
Mr.
Mesquita, but
the
senior
officers made
the
call
to
affect the
arrest.
[
51
]
Counsel
for
Mr.
Mesquita
argues
that
there
was
a
breach
of
Mr.
Mesquita's
Charter
rights as a result
of him being
arrested.
They
submit that
the police
should have
done
more to investigate the meaning
of "reside each and every night" before placing him under arrest.
The remedy sought by counsel is a reduction
in his sentence on the charges before me.
[
52
]
I find no
misconduct or
Charter
breaches on the part of the
police
.
Acting on what they believed to be
essentially a curfew condition, they arrested Mr. Mesquita for being outside at
"night
".
The search incident to that arrest was of a backpack that was
within reach of
Mr. Mesquita and was
nothing more than a cursory look inside.
[
53
]
Where the problem lies is with the bail
condition itself.
It is difficult to
imagine a more vague condition on a form of release.
While it is not a specified
"curfew",
it certainly appears to be one.
Otherwise, what is meant by
"each
and
every night"?
It could not
possibly
be
the
case
that
the
condition requires
Mr
.
Mesquita to
put
his
foot
in
the
door at least once every night
,
and
thus
be
in
compliance with
the
condition
.
But
if
not
a
curfew, then why not simply say -
"
reside
at the address"?
[
54
]
The Crown, in
withdrawing the charge immediately the next day, was correct to do so
.
The term in the bail was
doomed from the beginning, being far too vague for any meaningful
interpretation.
As the
Supreme Court of Canada
noted
in
R
.
v.
Zora,
2020
SCC 14
at
paragraph
102
:
Ultimately, the obligation to ensure that accused persons
are released on appropriate bail orders lies with the judicial official. As
with the setting of cash deposits in
Antic,
if a judicial official does not understand how a condition is
appropriate, "a
justice or
a
judge
setting bail
is
under
a
positive
obligation" to make inquiries into whether the suspect bail condition is
necessary, reasonable, least onerous, and sufficiently linked to the accused's
risks (paras. 56 and 67(i)). Before transforming bail conditions into
personal
sources
of
potential
criminal
liability,
judicial
officials
are
asked to
use
their
discretion
with
care
and
review
the
proposed
conditions
to
make sure
they are focussed,
narrow, and
tightly-framed
to
address
the accused's
risks.
(Emphasis added).
[
55
]
“
Reside at an address
each and every night
”
is certainly
not, in my view
,
"
focussed, narrow or
tightly
-
framed".
Careless
language such
as
this
leads
to
the
exact
problem
we saw unfold in this case.
[
56
]
All
of
this
being
said, I
cannot say
that
Mr. Mesquita was arrested without grounds. The police
interpretation of the condition as a curfew was reasonable.
But the condition should
never
have
been
open
to
interpretation
in
the
first
place
.
I
am
told
this
is
a
common condition in our Bail
Courts nowadays.
I was startled by
this
submission, as it
is far too
vulnerable to misinterpretation, as demonstrated here.
[
57
]
In all the
circumstances, due to this unfortunate event, I am prepared to treat this
incident as a further mitigating circumstance on Mr. Mesquita’s sentence.  I
want to be clear that I do not find any fault on the part of the police, but it
was also not Mr. Mesquita’s fault.  Unfortunately, he was arrested in front of
his family and spent a night in jail because of this poorly drafted bail
condition.
CONCLUSION
[
58
]
Robbing innocent
parties while they are simply going about their daily routines is a cowardly
and disgusting act.
Mr. Mesquita and
his accomplices did not care about the psychological or
physical
harm
they
may
cause
with
their
actions.
Somebody could
have been
seriously
hurt
,
either
during
the
actual
robbery,
or
while
the
offenders
were
escaping
in
the
stolen
vehicles
and/or
Mr.
Mesquita's car
at
a
high
rate
of
speed.
It
is
very
fortunate that
no known physical injuries were ever incurred.
[
59
]
It is also clear
that these
offences
were based
solely
on greed
and they
were committed more than once
,
over a number of days
.
[
60
]
After
considering
the aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
,
the
governing case law
and the need to deter and denounce this type of crime
,
I find that a sentence
of 2 years is the fit sentence.
[
61
]
A reasonably informed member of the
public, knowing all of the circumstances of this offence
and
this
offender,
must
know
that
these
types
of
offences
carry
with
them strict penalties.
But when that same member of the public
sees all of the following mitigating circumstances in this case, they will
understand the sentence that is being
imposed
.
•
Mr. Mesquita was at
the bottom of this hierarchy.
While
he was a party of the offence,
the
Crown
does
not
take
issue
with
fact
that
he
was
the
"outsider"
of
this group,
who
was
maybe frightened of
his
co-accused
and
who
,
on
the
night of
his arrest, confessed to the police about his involvement.
•
His PSR and letters of
reference are very positive.
I accept that this encounter with the
criminal justice system was contrary to his typical behaviour.
•
He
is
a
first-time
offender
and
pled
guilty.
While
he
pled
guilty
after
his
preliminary inquiry
,
the preliminary inquiry was conducted in an efficient manner and
committal to stand trial was never significantly contested.
•
Mr
.
Mesquita was subsequently arrested as a result of an
unreasonable bail condition.
I
have
no
information as
to
how
this
condition
came
into
being, but
for what
it's worth, I would strongly suggest it no longer form part of any judicial
interim release order
.
While I find no fault on the part of the police or Mr
.
Mesquita
,
I do find the incident to
be
an exceptional mitigating circumstance.
[
62
]
Having found that the appropriate
sentence
in Mr
.
Mesquita's
case is a
term of 2
years in
the penitentiary
,
I need not consider if a Conditional
Sentence is appropriate, as it is unavailable to him in these circumstances.
[
63
]
I repeat, without placing too much
emphasis
on
this one factor
,
car thefts and the
types
of robberies committed here are on the rise in our community.
Like Justice Latimer
in
Dhillon
,
I make this finding on the basis of judicial notice as a
judge who works and resides in this community.
The prevalence of this form of criminality and the fear it is inflicting
on this community is yet another additional aggravating feature in
this case
.
[
64
]
I
also
,
as
I
must
,
take
into
account that
the
co-accused,
who also
pled
guilty in
this case,
received
sentences of
4
and
3
1/2
years
,
and
for
Mr
.
Francois, who had
no
criminal record,
2
½
years.
As
noted,
their
personal
circumstances are
different than
those
of
Mr
.
Mesquita
,
and
I
ultimately recognize that
by
imposing
a
lower
sentence
for
him.
But
even if it were a sentence of less than 2
years, I do not accept that a Conditional Sentence would be
appropriate
.
While there are
mitigating circumstances in
his
case, I
do
not
find that those mitigating circumstances
rise to the level of exceptional circumstances
,
justifying
a Conditional Sentence for two robberies
.
[
65
]
I
am
sympathetic
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Mesquita
is
a
new
father
and
a
first-time offender
.
At
the
end of
the day
,
though
,
there
were 2
robberies and one attempt robbery in
this
case.
These
were
not
cars
stolen
out
of
a
driveway, but
rather
,
they
were
cars
that were violently taken from innocent
people who were just going about their day.
[
66
]
This sentence is
necessary to
denounce
the
seriousness of
these violent actions,
and
to
send the proper message to the community and like-minded offenders that such
offences will be treated seriously
.
Had this not been a guilty plea
,
which I accept as a sign of
remorse and a
significant mitigating factor
,
the sentence would have
been much higher.
I again
borrow from
the words of
Justice Latimer
in
the
Casseus
decision
where His Honour stated at paragraph 35:
While the Court (of
course) does not direct prosecutorial decision-making, it
does
speak
through
its
judgments.
Criminal
sentence
decisions
in
Halton
Region will
take into consideration
local trends and conditions.
Given
the
current
epidemic
of
auto
theft
...
the
local
sentence
range
for
this
criminality
is trending upwards
.
[
67
]
While
this jail term is
a
significant restriction
on Mr.
Mesquita's liberty, it is not so crushing
a
sentence as to snuff out any possibility of rehabilitation.
It will also allow Mr. Mesquita to access
various resources that are available in the jail.
Mr. Mesquita has shown
initiative
and hard work in the past, making several impressive accomplishments thus far
in his life.
It is
unfortunate,
and frankly,
puzzling,
why he decided to participate in the
crime spree that he did.
But if he
truly does want to further his education and employment
skills, he
will
have
access
to
such
programs
in
the
institution.
I
hope
that
he
takes advantage of
those
opportunities, and
after serving
his
sentence, comes out of
the institution with a renewed desire to
make his family, and himself, proud.
THE
SENTENCE
[
68
]
Mr. Mesquita, you are sentenced to 2
years in jail. There is an order pursuant to
section 109
of the
Criminal
Code
, prohibiting you from possessing any firearm, crossbow, restricted
weapon, firearm part, ammunition and explosive substance for life. There will
also be a sample of your DNA taken today. Finally, there will be an order
pursuant to
section 743.21
of the
Criminal Code
, prohibiting you from
communicating with your co­ accused, while in custody. Those names will be
outlined in the order that I will review and sign.
[
69
]
You made a huge mistake in committing
these offences, as it has seriously jeopardized your once bright future. But
they were not offences that were a one-off. They were premeditated and
calculated, in conjunction with others, with the sole goal of terrorizing
members of this community. For that, the sentence must address the seriousness
of the offence.
[
70
]
I have taken into account your role in
this case, your guilty plea and your otherwise clean past. You have
demonstrated in the past that you are capable of doing good things, and once
your sentence is complete, there is nothing stopping you from making a better
life for yourself. While I have given you a significantly lesser sentence than
your co­ accused for a number of reasons I have discussed in detail, it would
not be appropriate to allow you to serve this sentence in the community. That
would not send the proper message to likeminded individuals, nor would it
adequately denounce the seriousness of your offence.
