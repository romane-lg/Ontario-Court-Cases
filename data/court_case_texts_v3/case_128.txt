ONTARIO COURT OF JUSTICE
CITATION:
R. v. Rush
, 2025 ONCJ 516
DATE: 
2025 10 03
COURT
FILE No.:  Belleville 24-13101666
BETWEEN:
HIS
MAJESTY THE KING
— AND
—
ROOSEVELT RUSH
Before
Justice R. B. Horton
September
2, 2025
Reasons
for Judgment released on October 3, 2025
L. Ross.................................................................................................. counsel
for the Crown
M. O’Doherty..................................................  
counsel for the accused Roosevelt Rush
HORTON, J.:
[
1
]
Mr. Roosevelt Rush plead guilty before me to one
count of trafficking in cocaine and one count of failure to comply with
released order.  The facts support that he is found to possess 55.29 g of
cocaine, this having been confirmed by the Health Canada certificate.
[
2
]
Crown submits that the appropriate sentence is
two years.  Defence counsel submits a sentence of six months, less one day, is
appropriate.  The Offender’s experience as a black man was raised for the
court’s consideration in a previously prepared impact of race and culture
assessment proffered having been prepared April 14, 2025, or an earlier
sentencing seating in order to fully canvass the potential impact of this Offender’s
race.
[
3
]
The court received additional information to
assist in determining the appropriate sentence for this specific offender,
including the following:
(a)
several letters of reference in favour of Mr. Rush;
(b)
letter of the Offender;
(c)
criminal record of the offender, noting that Mr.
Rush had not been sentenced on these charges at the time of the offence herein;
and
(d)
sentencing chart as prepared by the Crown.
Agreed Facts Supporting Guilty Pleas
[
4
]
Mr. Rush was released December 2022, on charges
of possession for the purposes of trafficking (two counts), proceeds of crime
and possession of a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm.  The release order
included surety and strict conditions including GPS monitoring.
[
5
]
Mr. Rush was found to have travelled to
Belleville as noted through the GPS monitoring.  However, at this time it was
unknown whether he was with or without his surety.  On a second occasion he was
seen within the city of Belleville absent his surety resulting in his arrest
for failing to comply with his release order.
[
6
]
As a result of a search incident to arrest
number of items were located, including a total of 55.29 g of cocaine, two cell
phones, Canadian currency and the accused driver’s license.
[
7
]
The accused has no unused presentence custody.
[
8
]
The accused has a criminal record.  However, at
the time of the offence herein, he had not yet been sentenced.
Seriousness of Cocaine and the
Impact on the Community
[
9
]
There is no disputing cocaine is an extremely
dangerous and insidious drug with potential to cause a great deal of harm to
individuals and to society. Likewise, possession of crack cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking is a serious offence warranting emphasis on the
principles of deterrence and denunciation.
[
10
]
However, when sentencing an offender convicted
of such an offence, it is incumbent on the trial judge to consider
all
of the principles of sentencing – including the accused's prospects for
rehabilitation.
Section 718
of the
Criminal Code
directs a sentencing
judge to consider the full panoply of sentencing objectives, including, but not
limited to, assisting in the rehabilitation of offenders.
Circumstances of the Offender
Social Context Evidence
[
11
]
Mr. Rush is a 32-year-old black man who at the
time of these offensives had no criminal record although admittedly waiting
sentencing on serious charges for which he had entered plea.  He is the father
of three children, is a permanent resident of Canada, and faces the likeliness
of deportation to Jamaica, due to his most recent convictions and now, these
charges.
[
12
]
Social context evidence in the form of an
assessment report outlining the impact of race and culture on Mr. Rush.  This
report was prepared by Ms. L.  Newman of the Viola Desmond Justice Institute in
Montréal.
[
13
]
The contents of this report have properly and
fully been reviewed by this Court previously in the unreported reasons for
sentence prepared by Madame Justice Lacelle who at paragraph 6 through19
thoroughly summarizes the report as follows:
6.        The report outlines
Mr. Rush’s background as a child in Jamaica. He grew up in an area that was
high with criminal activity, and which affected his family’s safety. It was a
regular occurrence
to hear
gunshots. When he
was 12, Mr. Rush’s uncle
was
stabbed by a
friend. His family went
to the scene and Mr. Rush witnessed this horror. Another uncle was beaten to
death
with an
iron rod
when
he
was
in high
school.
Mr.
Rush
remembers
his
mother’s
intense grief and pain following the loss
of her brother. Mr. Rush has also lost two friends from Jamaica, one who was
shot in the head, the other who died from cancer. He has also experienced
losses in Canada, including one of Ms. McFaquhar’s sons, who was murdered. Some
of his experiences have affected him profoundly and he would like to explore
them in
counselling.
7.
Mr.
Rush
reports
that
his
parents
never
told
him
that
they
loved
him,
and
this
bothers
him.
He
was
also
raised
in
a
household
with
a
high
level
of
conflict
and
instability.
He
was
teased,
had limited access to food, felt neglected and abandoned, and was
exposed to violence, death and loss. He was introduced to substance use early.
8.
The divorce of his parents when he
was a teenager was also impactful for him and has contributed to Mr. Rush’s
need to get his father’s approval, a common theme throughout his narrative
according to Ms. Newman. In addition to the emotional turmoil of this
separation, Mr. Rush reported feeling like the “black sheep” of his family. He
was the target of teasing about his weight from family and others. He felt
overlooked by family members, when compared
to
his
siblings.
At
various
points,
Mr.
Rush
experienced
low
self
-
esteem
and
a
sense of disconnection from his family. More recently, there
has been some improvement, and he now
had
a
closer
relationship
with
his
mother,
with
whom
he
communicates
weekly.
Her
recent stroke and
diagnosis of brain cancer have been a source of continuous worry for Mr. Rush.
9.
Mr.
Rush’s
relationship
with
his
father
continues
to
be
strained.
Mr.
Rush’s
father
had
a
history of
denigrating
him verbally. That Mr. Rush’s father
was
not proud of
him remains painful for
Mr. Rush, who reports that his father has not reached out for some time.
10.
Mr.
Rush
does
not
have
a
close
relationship
with
his
siblings
at
this
time.
However,
he
does
have
a
relationship
with
Ms.
McFaquhar,
who
was
one
of
his
father’s
girlfriends,
and
who
has acted like a mother figure to him.
She has known him since he was a child, and he has on occasion
lived
with
her.
Her
children
have
known
Mr.
Rush
their
whole
lives
and
are
close
to
him.
11.
Mr. Rush has had two significant relationships
which resulted in three children. His first was when he was 19 years old, when
Mr. Rush’s formal immigration process started. Mr. Rush’s
son
Roosevelt
Jr.
was
born
in
2018
when
Mr.
Rush
was
25.
Mr.
Rush
has
co-parented
his son with his son’s mother, which is reported to be going well.
12.
Mr. Rush’s current partner, Rachel
Bakker, has been in his life since 2020.They had their first child Rojae in
2021, and their second, Rosalie, in 2023. Ms. Bakker describes that Mr. Rush
feels
he
needs
to
be
the
breadwinner
in
the
family
and
likes
to
be
able
to
provide.
When he had difficulty finding work, this had a significant negative
impact on him mentally and
emotionally.
13.
All persons contacted for the
report described Mr. Rush as a good and involved father. During his
incarceration, Mr. Rush has spoken with them daily. He also sees them every two
or three weeks when their mothers bring them to visit with him at the detention
centre.
14.
As for his mental and physical
health, Mr. Rush has hypertension and GERD. While Mr. Rush has never been
diagnosed, he suspects he may have ADD or ADHD, given what he has learned in
order to support his son, who has been recently diagnosed with ADHD. Ms. Baker
reports
he
would
often
cry
and
stay
in
bed
for
long
periods
of
time
and
exhibit
other
depressive
symptoms, especially when he was not making enough money. Ms. Newman links this
experience to the impact of the inability to fulfill the provider role, noting
that structural barriers limiting Black’s men’s access to financial stability
can lead to heightened stress-related health concerns.
15.
As
for
his
education,
Mr.
Rush
completed
high
school
in
Jamaica,
which
ended
in
grade
11.
In
the
future,
he
would
like
to
complete
a
program
in
construction
to
be
able
to
get employment in that field.
16.
Mr. Rush has a strong work history
in Canada, where he has lived since he was 19. He worked as a
forklift operator
with a
company for
two years until Covid hit. He
drove an Uber to
get
some
income.
He
tried
to
find
work
elsewhere
in
the
country,
but
was
told
there
were
no
opportunities and returned to Ontario. He
got
a job delivering Ikea furniture, during which he injured his back. He had to be
off work and, without a family doctor, was unable to provide the
documentation
he
needed
to
keep
his
job.
Feeling
that
he
had
exhausted
most
of
his
options,
Mr. Rush said he chose to engage in the illicit activities he saw his peers
engaged in to have income. At the time, Ms. Baker was on maternity leave and
there was not enough income to keep their apartment. While engaged in illicit
activity, he was able to pay his bills and get an apartment again after living
with Ms. Baker’s parents. He was able to do a bit extra for his kids, such as
buy them bikes, and get a car to help the family be more mobile.
17.
Ms. Newman writes that Mr. Rush’s
experiences as he attempted to earn an income to be able
to
survive
are
inextricably
linked
to
his
entity
as
a
Black
man
within
western
culture.
She writes that for
black men in middle adulthood, their sense of manhood is often tied to their
ability to fulfill roles such as provider, husband, father, employee and
community member. However, they face systemic obstacles that hinder success in
these roles. For instance, historically, they have earned below 75% of white
men’s wages.
18.
Ms.
Newman
outlines
how
research
shows
that
men
of
African
descent
are
five
times
more likely
to
be
incarcerated than
their
white
counterparts.
Black
people
now
account
for
over
9% of federal inmates, while comprising
only 4% of the overall population. As she notes, these findings underscore
ongoing disparities rooted in systemic racism.
19.
Ms. Newman concludes that Mr.
Rush’s involvement with the criminal justice system is inextricably tied to the
systemic barriers that influenced his decision-making. Some of the factors
that
contributed
to
his
social
development
and
his
increased
marginalization
include
his exposure
to
trauma
and
losses,
insufficient
educational
support,
exposure
to
crime
and
violence
in
a
volatile
community,
working
in
cash
jobs with
little
to
no
benefits,
and the
impacts
of
the
pandemic.
Even
so,
he
has
exhibited
strength
and
potential.
He
is
an
involved
and
loving
father. He is ambitious and wants to
provide for his family. He has made efforts to find work and wants to further
his education and build new skills. He would be best served by accessing
services and resources that are culturally responsive in a community setting.
Ms. Newman identifies in her report several resources that might assist him.
Reference Letters
[
14
]
Several people have provided letters in support
of Mr. Rush, notably this court received letters in support from the following
individuals:
(a)
Ms. Rachel Bakker, mother of Mr. Rush’s two
youngest children;
(b)
Ms. Emma Gillmore, mother of Mr. Rush’s eldest
child:
(c)
Ms. Princess Mcfaquar;
(d)
Ms. Shantol Rush, his sister;
(e)
Ms. Amanda Edwards, his sister; and
(f)
Mr. Thierry Rusell, his brother.
[
15
]
The above individuals describe Mr. Rush similarly,
noting him to be an involved father, an active member in the community and
overall, a positive influence on their lives.  Through these character
reference letters, one can see the work ethic and potential that Mr. Rush has. 
Sadly, each also depicts much trauma and heartbreak which Mr. Rush has
experienced in his life.
Mr. Rush’s own words
[
16
]
Mr. Rush prepared a written letter to this Court
in which he makes a valid and sincere attempt to communicate his understanding
and remorse for what has brought him before this Court.  I note that, while
these materials, inclusive of the letters of reference and Mr. Rush’s own
letter were presented to the previous court, I accept these as being equally
relevant to these proceedings.
[
17
]
It is clear that Mr. Rush has spent considerable
time throughout his periods of incarceration, thinking of how he may move
forward and overcome the consequences of his choices that have brought him to
this point in his life.  He speaks openly and with great warmth of his children,
the love that he has for them, noting significantly how he wishes them to
follow by his current example and to give them a life that he did not have
growing up.  He wants to be a role model and not follow his current path.  I
accept his regrets and equally his concerns for his children and how he wishes
to be a positive influence on them.
Principles of Sentencing
[
18
]
The fundamental purpose of sentencing is confirmed in s. 718.
That section provides that the sanction imposed by the court should have one or
more of the following objectives:
(1)
To
denounce
unlawful
conduct;
(2)
To
deter
the
offender
and
other
persons
from
committing
offence;
(3)
To
separate
offenders from
society,
where
necessary;
(4)
To
assist
in
rehabilitating
offenders;
(5)
To
provide
reparations
for
harm
done
to
victims
or to
the
community;
and
(6)
To
promote
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
offenders,
and
acknowledgment
of
the
harm done to victims and to the community.
[
19
]
Section
718.2
of
the
Code
identifies
additional
principles
of
sentencing,
including
that
the court
should increase or decrease the sentence to account for any relevant
aggravating or mitigating factors.
[
20
]
The fundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence must
be proportionate to the gravity
of
the
offence
and
the
responsibility
of
the
offender.
Imposing
a
proportionate
sentence is
an
individualized
exercise.
The
sentence
must
be
tailored
having
regard
to
the
gravity
of
the offence, the
blameworthiness of the offender, and the harm caused by the crime:
R. v. Nur
,
2015 SCC 15
at para.
43
.
[
21
]
The parity principle requires a judge to consider the range of
sentence imposed in similar matters. The
Criminal Code
requires that a
sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for
similar offences committed in similar circumstances. A judge must also apply
the principle of restraint. An offender should not be deprived of liberty if
less restrictive sanctions are appropriate in the circumstances.
[
22
]
Further, section
10(1)
of the
Controlled
Drugs
and
Substances
Act
applies
in
this
context. It states that the fundamental purpose of any sentence
for an offence under this Part is to contribute to the respect for the law and
the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society while
encouraging
rehabilitation,
and
treatment
in
appropriate
circumstances,
of
offenders
and acknowledging the harm done to
victims and to the community.
Principle of Restraint
[
23
]
The
Criminal Code
codifies the principle of restraint in
ss. 718.2(d) and (e). The restraint principle operates both when deciding
whether incarceration is appropriate, and if so, it must be
considered
in
fixing
the
length
of
that
incarceration.
This
is
particularly
so
with
young
and youthful first offenders, as well as first offenders:
R. v.
Priest
,
1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA)
, [1996] O.J. No. 3369;
R. v. Batisse,
(2009)
2009 ONCA 114 (CanLII)
, 93 O.R. (3d) 643
(C.A.). The sentencing objective of rehabilitation must be considered, even
though in serious cases and cases involving violence, it is not the
determinative factor:
Batisse
at para.
34
. Courts must be mindful to not
focus exclusively on general deterrence to the exclusion of consideration of
specific deterrence and rehabilitation.
[
24
]
Like other sentencing principles, however, the restraint
principle “operates within the boundaries set by the fundamental principal of
proportionality”. This is because “the
fundamental
principle
of
proportionality
must
prevail
in
every
case”:
Morris
at
para.
112,
citing
R.
v.
Suter,
2018 SCC 34
at
para.
56
.
Principle of
Totality
[
25
]
This sentence follows an early sentencing in which Mr. Rush received
a significant custodial sentence for similar offences though relating to
possession for the purpose of trafficking in fentanyl and gun related
offences.  The charges for which Mr. Rush is being sentenced here were
committed prior to the earlier sentencing and it is appropriate that the
current sentence which he is serving be considered in determining a fit and
reasonable sentence.
[
26
]
Judges
must
ensure
that
a
series
of
sentences
are
“just
and
appropriate”:
s.
718.2(c).
“This involves taking ‘one last look at
the combined sentence’ to assess whether it is ‘unduly long or harsh, in the
sense that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree
of responsibility of the offender’”. Sentences may be adjusted by making some
concurrent to
respect
the
totality
principle.
If
this
“does
not
achieve
a
just
and
appropriate
sentence”,
a
judge may reduce
the length of one or more sentences.
R. v. Morris
[
27
]
The case
of
R. v. Morris
,
2021 ONCA 680
, which dealt with the impact of
anti-Black racism
on
sentencing,
is
relevant
to
determining
a
fit
sentence
in
this
case.
This
is
particularly so since I have the benefit
of an IRCA report in considering the appropriate sentence for Mr.
Rush.
[
28
]
Morris
provides
that
social
context
evidence
relating
to
an
offender’s
life
experiences
may be
used
where
relevant
to
mitigate
the
offender’s
degree
of
responsibility
for
the
offence
and/or to assist in the blending of the principles and objectives of
sentencing to achieve a sentence which
best
serves
the
purposes
of
sentencing
as
described
in
s.
718
.
This
is so
even
though an offender’s
experience
with
anti-Black
racism
does
not
impact
on
the
seriousness
or
gravity
of the offence – anti-Black racism remains relevant for other reasons.
Morris
also directs courts that
“a
generous
gateway for
the admission
of
objective
and balanced
social
context
evidence should be provided”: at para.
13; see also
R. v. Stewart
,
2022 ONSC 6997
.
[
29
]
Further,
Morris
“explains
that
in
order
for
circumstances
related
to
systemic
discrimination to
be
a
factor
in
sentencing,
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
offences
and
the disadvantages
the offender
faced tied
to
systemic discrimination”:
Stewart
at
para.
70
;
Morris
at
paras.
76
and
97
.
I
will
address
how
this
applies
to
Mr.
Rush
later
in
these
reasons.
Collateral Consequences
[
30
]
There are,
undoubtedly, important collateral consequences to be considered in this case,
namely the immigration and family consequences that will occur following the
sentencing of Mr. Rush. Their relevance flows from the application of
the principles of individualization and
parity. The weight to be given to collateral consequences varies from case to
case and should be determined having regard to the type and seriousness of the
offence: at para. 12.
[
31
]
The weight
in my view of these consequences is significantly, if not wholly, vacated as a
result of his earlier conviction and sentence however I will briefly review
these.
[
32
]
Mr. Rush
is not a Canadian citizen and he is likely to be deported as a result of these
offences. This is a significant collateral consequence.
[
33
]
While
a
sentencing
judge
may
exercise
her discretion to take
collateral immigration consequences into account, the sentence imposed must
remain
proportionate
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence
and
the
degree
of
responsibility
of
the
offender.
[
34
]
A
custodial
sentence
will
have
significant
consequences for Mr. Rush, his children,
and their mothers. These consequences are appropriately to be weighed in
determining a fit sentence: see also
R. v. D.B
.,
2025 ONCA 577
. As noted
given his prior sentencing the effects of this particular sentencing will not
result in a significant change to the existing circumstances but I am aware
that the additional sentence will further prolong the already existing
consequences to all.
[
35
]
In
R.
v. Habib
,
2024 ONCA 830
, Tulloch C.J., writing for the court, provided
guidance
on
how
to
address
these
consequences
in
cases
where
the
victim
of
the
crime
is not a family member of the defendant.  He stated,
As
recognized
in
R.
v.
Spencer
(2004),
2004 CanLII 5550 (ON CA)
, 72
O.R.
(3d)

(C.A.),
at
para.
46
,
leave
to appeal refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 4,
it is an unfortunate reality that sentencing defendants to prison often harms
their families. Family members are deprived of the defendant’s love and care
and suffer the emotional pain of separation. They must often assume the added
burdens of the breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities that the defendant
formerly performed. Further, they may suffer financial hardship, educational
deprivation, and even the loss of the family residence. See

The courts have been careful not to
let these consequences overwhelm the other principles of sentencing. See
R.
v. Dent
,
2023 ONCA 460
, 167 O.R. (3d) 161, at para.
124
. As emphasized in
Spencer
,
these consequences are not an excuse to overlook the harm that the defendant’s
criminal conduct caused victims of crime, or the importance of protecting those
victims and society, or the need for denunciation
and
deterrence.
Further, these consequences cannot
justify imposing a disproportionate sentence. Thus, this court has sometimes
imposed or affirmed significant prison sentences to respect the other
principles
of
sentencing
even
after
accounting
for
family
separation
consequences, as
in
Spencer
.
But as
Spencer
ruled,
sentencing judges must “preserve the family as much as possible” within these
limits. As that case explained, if incarceration is necessary, sentencing
judges must give serious and sufficient consideration to family separation
consequences in “determining the length of [the] prison term.” See at para. 47.
Thus, depending on the facts,
family separation consequences may justify a sentence adjustment – even a
significant one – or a departure from the range. See
R.
v.
Forsythe
,
[1976]
O.J.
No.
1026 (C.A.), at paras. 5-6
. This is true
even for grave offences that require deterrence and
denunciation,
as
in
Spencer
,
where
the
court
considered
that
the
defendant
had “much to offer her children” in setting the sentence.
[

]
In
R.
v.
Spencer
,
the
court
overturned
a
conditional
sentence
for
a
black
single
mother
who was convicted of importing 733 grams of cocaine into Canada, and who
was at risk of deportation. The court found that a jail sentence of 40 months
should have been imposed.
[
37
]
The
offender had three young children at the time of sentencing. In considering
these circumstances
and
their
impact
upon
the
determination
of
a
fit
sentence,
Doherty
J.A.
wrote
at paras. 46-47:
It is a grim reality that the
young children of parents who choose to commit serious crimes
necessitating
imprisonment
suffer
for
the
crimes
committed
by
their
parents.
It
is
an equally grim reality that the children of parents who choose to bring
cocaine into Canada are not the only children who are the casualties of that
criminal conduct.
Children,
both through their use of cocaine and through the use of cocaine by their
parents,
are
heavily
represented
among
the
victims
of
the
cocaine
importer's
crime.
Any
concern about the best interests of children must have regard to all children
affected by this criminal conduct.
The
fact that Ms. Spencer has three children and plays a very positive and
essential role in their lives cannot diminish the seriousness of her crime or
detract from the need to impose a sentence that adequately denounces her
conduct and hopefully deters others from committing the same crime. Nor does it
reduce her personal culpability. It must, however, be acknowledged that in the
long-term, the safety and security of the community
is
best
served
by
preserving
the
family
unit
to
the
furthest
extent
possible.
In my
view,
in
these
circumstances,
those
concerns
demonstrate
the
wisdom
of
the
restraint principle in determining the
length of a prison term and the need to tailor that term to preserve the family
as much as possible. Unfortunately, given the gravity of the crime committed by
Ms. Spencer, the needs of her children cannot justify
a
sentence
below
the
accepted
range,
much
less
a
conditional
sentence.
[emphasis

The Offence
[
38
]
In determining a fit sentence, a sentencing
judge must be mindful of the principles of sentencing that have been applied
similar offences of cocaine trafficking.
[
39
]
As stated earlier, cocaine
trafficking is a serious offence warranting emphasis on the principles of
deterrence and denunciation. I have instructed myself on the above sentencing
principles and considerations, together with the objective of assisting Mr.
Rush in his rehabilitation.
Sentencing Ranges for Similar
Offences and Offenders
[
40
]
Similar offenders with similar circumstances
should receive similar sentences for like offences.  This is the parity of
sentencing but is not to override the principle of proportionality when
determining the fitness of a sentence.
[
41
]
The Crown submitted a sentencing brief of what
may be characterized as similar cases. I am mindful that no two cases are
identical and in this particular instance it is noted that the cases provided
were situations of significantly greater amounts of cocaine.  Nonetheless I
accept the range of sentence would be 2-5 years for a dealer of a quantity
similar to this circumstance, being characterized as a mid level trafficker. 
That is though only a starting point and as in any situation with proposed
ranges it is subject to the particular circumstances of a particular offender.
Aggravating Factors
[
42
]
The following aggravating circumstances are
established;
(a)
The quantum of cocaine, a dangerous drug, was
significant, being just shy of 2 ounces;
(b)
Mr. Rush is not an addict-dealer having
commenced his criminality for financial gain, whether as a means to support his
family or otherwise;
(c)
The Offender was on release conditions for drug
charges when arrested on the subject charges.
Mitigating and Contextual Factors
[
43
]
There are several mitigating and contextual
factors that have been established:
(a)
Mr. Rush has entered his plea of guilt avoiding
the need for a trial.  It is noted that the Crown’s case appears strong, with
potential defences not readily apparent;
(b)
Mr. Rush has shown a sincere level of remorse
evidenced by both his plea and his letter voicing a genuine regret for his
actions and the harm which he has caused not only to his family but the
community at large;
(c)
The social context evidence in the form or an
Impact of Race and Cultural Assessment supports that Mr. Rush’s life choices
and opportunities have been informed by systemic discrimination as has his
engagement in the criminal justice system as a young black man;
(d)
Mr. Rush has significant family support, support
which continues.  Those that love him are many and strongly speak to his
kindness, his devotion to his children and his strong work ethic.  Notably he
has the support of the mothers of his children;
(e)
Mr. Rush is a young man and is to be sentenced
as a first-time offender given that these charges arose prior to his sentencing
on the earlier charges;
(f)
Mr. Rush faces a significant likelihood of
deportation.  While the sentencing in this case will certainly be considered it
is apparent that his existing conviction and the resulting sentence is likely
to inform this decision notwithstanding the sentence issued in this proceeding;
and
(g)
Mr. Rush has shown that he has a willingness to
engage and address the underlying issues and to accept the penalties that he
faces.  I accept that he has a reasonable prospect for rehabilitation and to
become a pro-social member of his community.
Discussion and Conclusion
[
44
]
Trafficking in cocaine is a serious offence that
attracts a significant sentence.  In this instance Mr. Rush was on bail for
trafficking in significantly dangerous drugs and was arrested for similar
offences albeit not Fentanyl.  Again, I am mindful he had not yet been
sentenced.
[
45
]
I would characterize Mr. Rush as a mid-level
trafficker of cocaine. He is not an addict trafficker and elected to do this
purely for financial gain.
[
46
]
Assessing Mr. Rush’s moral responsibility is a
more delicate task.  The social context evidence and findings made herein
assist this Court. I accept that Mr. Rush experienced systemic and personal
discrimination as a Black man, and that this has certainly played a role in his
criminality.
[
47
]
There is a reasonable prospect that Mr. Rush can
be rehabilitated, factoring in his relatively young age, his expressed insight,
his strong family support and his devotion to his children.
[
48
]
This offence is significant, and his moral culpability is high.  A
proportionate sentence on these considerations alone would warrant a penitentiary
sentence of 24 months.
[
49
]
I
would have otherwise sentenced Mr. Rush to such a sentence but for the fact he
is serving a significant penitentiary sentence of 6 years and the mitigating
circumstances outlined. Mr. Rush will be sentenced to 12 months custody.
[
50
]
The
sentence will be as follows:
(a)
12 months custody in relation to Count 4, Possession for the Purpose of
trafficking cocaine;
(b)
There is no pre-sentence custody to be credited;
(c)
90 days concurrent on count 2, the failure to comply to release
conditions;
(d)
S. 109 weapons prohibition for life;
(e)
DNA – secondary designated offence on both counts; and
(f)
Forfeiture order for all items seized.
