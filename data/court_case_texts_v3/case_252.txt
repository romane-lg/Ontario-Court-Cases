for the defendant
Akashkumar Narendrakumar Khant
P.T. O’Marra,
J.:
Introduction:
[
1
]
Mr. Khant appears before this Court having
pleaded guilty to one count of the attempted commission of an indecent act,
contrary to
section 173(1)
(b) of the
Criminal Code
. The Crown proceeded
by summary conviction. This was a case that I extensively judicially pre-tried
with both counsel.
[
2
]
The Crown seeks a sentence of 90 days' custody.
The Defence proposes a conditional discharge, accompanied by 12 months'
probation with strict conditions, including a three-month period of house
arrest.
The Acknowledged Facts:
[
3
]
On December 13th, 2023, the Peel Regional Police
Human Trafficking Unit commenced Project Juno - an online investigation focused
on individuals seeking to obtain sexual services from persons under 18 years of
age.
[
4
]
On the same day, Mr. Khant contacted a sex trade
advertisement that was created by police on Leolist.cc.
[
5
]
Mr. Khant engaged in conversation over text with
an undercover officer by contacting the number listed on the advertisement. The
text of that conversation was appended to the Agreed Statement of Facts as Tab
A.
[
6
]
Mr. Khant communicated with the undercover officer
and was informed on several occasions during the conversation that she was 15
years old. Mr. Khant continued the conversation. An agreement was made for the
purchase of a ‘girlfriend experience’ which entailed both oral and vaginal
intercourse for $140.
[
7
]
Mr. Khant received instructions to attend the
Holiday Inn hotel located at 5595 Ambler Drive in the City of Mississauga to
obtain the agreed-upon sexual services.
[
8
]
Mr. Khant attended the designated room, knocked
on the door and was subsequently arrested. A cellular phone and $140.00 cash were
seized from Mr. Khant incidentally to his arrest.
[
9
]
Mr. Khant attempted to commit an indecent act
with the undercover officer. He was indifferent or reckless as to the presence
of others during the attempted commission of the indecent act, and the act was
therefore intended, in law, to be done willfully in the presence of one or more
persons.
Mr. Khant’s Background:
[
10
]
I have gleaned much, if not all, of Mr. Khant’s
background and risk from Dr. Kalia’s Psychosexual Risk Assessment dated
September 18, 2024.
Personal and Educational Background
[
11
]
Mr. Khant is 32 years old. He is originally from
Surat, Gujarat, India. Raised in a stable and nurturing family environment, he
reported no history of abuse, neglect, or domestic conflict. His parents
emphasized moral values and education, and he maintains a close relationship
with his sister, who resides in Germany. Mr. Khant excelled academically,
earning a full scholarship to study civil engineering at Gujarat Technological
University. After working in India for several years, he immigrated to Canada
in 2019 to pursue a Master’s degree in civil engineering at the University of
Windsor, which he completed in 2021. He has since worked in the construction
and public transit sectors and became a permanent resident in 2023. He is
currently in the final stages of obtaining his professional engineering licence
and is also pursuing certification in project management.
Sexual History and Incident Context
[
12
]
Mr. Khant described himself as sexually
inexperienced before marriage, with a limited dating history. He met his wife,
Sangna Patel, in 2021, and they married in 2023. Their sexual relationship
initially was active, but later became strained due to her medical issues.
Seeking variety and intimacy, Mr. Khant began browsing Leolist, a classified
site for adult services. Since this incident, he has expressed deep remorse,
disclosed the incident to his wife, and started counselling shortly thereafter.
He emphasized to Dr. Kalia that he never intended to seek out underage
individuals and was motivated more by unmet emotional and sexual needs than by
deviant intent. However, I note that once he was advised that the escort was 15
years old, the text messages disclosed that he told her that “…if we get along
then. I will see you quite often.” This is suggestive of a continued interest
in underage girls.
Mental Health and Psychological
Testing
[
13
]
Mr. Khant underwent a battery of psychological
assessments. His intelligence was measured in the above-average range (IQ score
of 117). He showed no signs of major mental illness, personality disorder, or
antisocial traits. His responses on the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI)
were consistent and forthright, indicating a stable self-concept and no
evidence of impression management. He reported mild anxiety and depression,
which were interpreted as situational responses to the stress of legal
proceedings. His interpersonal style was described as modest and reserved, with
a tendency toward self-consciousness in social settings.
Counselling and Rehabilitation
Efforts
[
14
]
Following his arrest, Mr. Khant began offence-specific
counselling in April 2024 and completed 12 sessions. The counselling addressed
key areas such as consent, thinking errors, victim empathy, pornography use,
and relapse prevention. He demonstrated strong engagement, insight into his behaviour,
and a commitment to change. His therapist noted that he took full
responsibility for his actions and showed a genuine desire to avoid future
misconduct. He was particularly responsive to discussions about the impact of
sexual exploitation on victims and the importance of healthy communication in
intimate relationships. He remains open to continued therapy and joint sessions
with his wife to strengthen their relationship further.
Risk Assessment Findings
[
15
]
Mr. Khant was evaluated using several
standardized risk assessment tools. On the Static-99R, he scored a 3, placing
him in the average risk category for sexual reoffending. However, the Risk for
Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP-V2) found no indicators of sexual violence risk,
such as deviant sexual interests, use of force, or psychopathy. The Psychopathy
Checklist – Screening Version (PCL: SV) confirmed that he does not exhibit
traits associated with psychopathy. Phallometric testing showed some response
to younger females, which he acknowledged with surprise and agreed to explore
further in therapy. Overall, his risk of reoffending is considered low,
particularly given his remorse, lack of prior offences, and positive response
to treatment.
Collateral Information and Support
System
[
16
]
Collateral interviews with his wife and
therapist support the assessment’s findings. His wife described him as
empathetic, responsible, and family-oriented. She acknowledged the strain in
their sexual relationship due to her medical issues, but affirmed their
emotional bond and his remorse. She remains supportive and is open to joint counselling.
His therapist confirmed his motivation to change and his progress in therapy.
Mr. Khant has not disclosed the incident to his parents, fearing it would cause
them undue stress, and relies primarily on his wife and therapist for emotional
support.
Clinical Summary and Prognosis
[
17
]
Mr. Khant is described as a cooperative, polite,
and anxious individual who is deeply affected by the legal and immigration
consequences of his actions. He is considered naive and sexually inexperienced,
with no history of deviant or predatory behaviour. His actions appear to stem
from unmet emotional and sexual needs rather than malicious intent. He has
demonstrated a strong commitment to rehabilitation and is expected to benefit
from continued counselling. His prognosis is favourable, and he is deemed
suitable for community-based management. The report concludes that he poses a
low risk of reoffending and has the internal and external resources necessary
to make healthy, lawful choices in the future.
Immigration Consequences
[
18
]
According to an opinion from an immigration
lawyer that was provided to Mr. Bayliss, a conviction for an offence that can
be characterized as sexual would preclude Mr. Khant from sponsoring his wife,
under
section 133(1)
(e)(i) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(
IRPA
).
[
19
]
Ms. Patel is currently in Canada on a work visa
that expires on September 18, 2025. Upon the expiration of her work visa, she
will be required to leave Canada unless she is sponsored as a permanent
resident, qualifies for permanent residency independently, or otherwise
qualifies for an extension of her work permit. Given the current immigration
climate, obtaining work permit extensions is a challenging process. Without
several years of work experience in Canada, it is also difficult to
independently qualify for permanent resident status. Therefore, if Mr. Khant
cannot sponsor her, it is likely she will need to leave Canada, resulting in
the couple's separation. The bottom line is that if he faces a conviction
instead of a discharge, his wife will likely be subject to a removal order.
The Applicable Sentencing Principles
in Sexual Offences
Involving Minors
:
[
20
]
Sentencing for sexual offences involving minors
is governed by the general principles outlined in
sections 718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal
Code
. The primary objectives in these cases are denunciation and general
deterrence, reflecting the serious harm these offences pose to vulnerable
victims and society at large. Courts are required to impose sentences that are
proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender’s degree of
responsibility (s. 718.1). While denunciation and deterrence are paramount, the
principles of individualized sentencing, restraint, and rehabilitation remain
relevant, particularly for first-time or youthful offenders.
[
21
]
In
R. v. Friesen
,
2020 SCC 9
, the Supreme
Court of Canada emphasized that sentences for sexual offences against children
must reflect the gravity of the harm and the need for increased penalties.
However, it also reaffirmed the importance of proportionality and restraint,
especially for first-time offenders.
Sentencing Parameters in this Case:
[
22
]
The maximum penalty for an offence under section
173(1) of the
Code
is two years’ imprisonment if prosecuted by
indictment, and two years less one day imprisonment and/or a fine if prosecuted
summarily. An attempted indecent act is charged under
section 24(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
, which applies to any attempt to commit an offence, even if the act is
not completed. The sentencing range for an attempt is generally the same as for
the completed offence. Still, courts may impose a lower sentence based on the
incomplete nature of the act and the offender’s level of culpability.
The Defence’s position:
[
23
]
Mr. Khant is a first-time offender, relatively
young, with no prior record, and has completed counselling. He faces
devastating immigration and professional consequences if convicted.
[
24
]
Mr. Khant’s background (engineering graduate, PR
status, counselling, low-risk assessment) aligns with the rehabilitative focus
emphasized in the jurisprudence. A custodial sentence would undermine his
progress and prospects, contrary to the principle of restraint.
[
25
]
Mr. Bayliss provided a helpful book of authorities
and a sentencing chart, as well as legal principles and academic commentary
relevant to sentencing, particularly focusing on the use of conditional and
absolute discharges under
section 730
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
26
]
I do not propose to review every case and
commentary; however, I wish to highlight some of the important cases and the
applicable principles.
[
27
]
The foundational case of
R. v. Fallofield
,
1973 CanLII 1412 (BC CA)
, [1973] B.C.J.
No. 559 (BCCA), established the two-part test for granting discharges under
section 730
of the
Criminal Code
: first, that a discharge must be in the
best interests of the accused, and second, that it must not be contrary to the
public interest. This case emphasized that discharges are not limited to
trivial offences and that the public interest includes considerations of
rehabilitation and the avoidance of disproportionate consequences from a
conviction.
[
28
]
Subsequent cases applied these principles in varied contexts. For
example, in
R. v. Goodwin
,
[2020] O.J. No. 449 (ONSC)
, a police officer
who fired his weapon at a fleeing vehicle was denied a discharge due to the
seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence and
denunciation, particularly given his position of authority.
[
29
]
In contrast, in
R. v. Vicente
,
[2018] O.J. No. 5438
, the
Ontario Court of Justice granted a conditional discharge despite the
seriousness of the offence—domestic assault causing bodily harm. The court
considered the offender’s lack of prior record, family responsibilities, and
the potential employment impact of a conviction. The decision reinforced that
discharges are not confined to minor offences and that the sentencing process
must account for the broader context of the offender’s life.
[
30
]
Similarly, in
R. v. Oulianov
,
[2006] O.J. No. 3341 (ONSC)
,
a conditional discharge was granted for a fraud offence involving a forged
cheque. The court emphasized the offender’s youth, lack of prior record, and
the disproportionate impact a conviction would have on his future career. The
judge rejected the Crown’s argument that the offence was too serious for a
discharge, highlighting that the offence did not involve a breach of trust or
result in financial loss. In
R. v. Parkhomenko
,
[2006] O.J. No. 3904
(OCJ)
, a 24-year-old student received a conditional discharge after pleading
guilty to possession of credit card data and blank cards. The court emphasized
his youth, good character, and the rehabilitative potential that a conviction
would hinder.
[
31
]
R. v. Dicesare
,
[2018] B.C.J. No 7067 (BCPC)
and
R. v.
M.L.
,
[2019] O.J. No. 3809 (OCJ)
similarly granted discharges in cases
involving fraud, drug possession, and impaired driving, respectively, where the
courts emphasized the offenders’ lack of prior records, rehabilitative efforts,
and the collateral consequences of a conviction.
[
32
]
Building on this,
R. v. Mills
,
[2022] O.J. No. 2264
reaffirmed the importance of proportionality in sentencing. The Ontario Court
of Appeal granted an absolute discharge on appeal, finding that the trial judge
erred in requiring “exceptional” circumstances. The Court emphasized that the
impact of a criminal record on the offender’s employment and rehabilitation
prospects justified a discharge, especially where the offender had no prior
record, had paid restitution, and demonstrated remorse.
[
33
]
The constitutional dimensions of criminal records were addressed
in
P.H. v. Canada (Attorney General)
,
2020 FC 393 (CanLII)
, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 461 and
Chu v.
Canada (Attorney General)
,
2017 BCSC 630 (CanLII)
, [2017] B.C.J. No 742 (BCSC), where the courts
found that criminal records constitute “punishment” under
sections 11(h)
and
11(i)
of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. These cases
challenged the retrospective application of amendments to the
Criminal
Records Act
(
CRA
) introduced by the
Limiting Pardons for Serious
Crimes Act
(
LPSCA
) and the
Safe Streets and Communities Act
(
SSCA
),
which increased the waiting period for record suspension applications and
changed the criteria for granting them. The courts held that the transitional
provisions applying these changes retrospectively violated the
Charter
,
as they added to the punishment of offenders and could not be justified under
section 1
. These decisions underscore the severe and lasting collateral
consequences of a criminal record, including barriers to employment, housing,
and social integration.
[
34
]
Together, these cases form a robust legal framework supporting
the use of discharges in appropriate cases. They emphasize the importance of
individualized sentencing, the need to consider the offender's potential for
rehabilitation, and the disproportionate impact a conviction can have on future
opportunities. They also affirm that the justice system must be responsive to
the broader social and constitutional implications of criminal records,
particularly for first-time offenders and those who have demonstrated genuine
efforts at rehabilitation.
The Crown’s position:
[
35
]
The Crown’s response reflects a firm stance on
maintaining sentencing parity and upholding the principles of denunciation and
deterrence, despite the unique mitigating factors presented by the Defence.
[
36
]
The Crown acknowledges that Mr. Khant was the
first individual arrested under Project Juno and the only one of the 32 charged to plead to attempted indecent act  rather than child
luring. While recognizing that the case had evidentiary weaknesses—such as a
partial phone download, lack of surveillance footage showing him at the hotel
room door, and a failed test call—the Crown maintains that the case was still
strong and that these issues, while potentially affecting reasonable prospect
of conviction, do not justify a discharge or non-custodial sentence.
[
37
]
The Crown’s suggestion for a 90-day custodial sentence is consistent with
the sentences imposed on others involved in Project Juno. They argue that parity is essential and that
granting a more lenient sentence would undermine the principle of equal
treatment. The Crown also emphasizes that denunciation and deterrence are
paramount in offences of this nature, especially those involving sexual conduct
and potential exploitation.
[
38
]
In response to the Defence’s argument about 
immigration consequences, the
Crown concedes that while these may be unfortunate, they are mitigating
factors within the sentencing range, not outside of it. The Crown cited
R.
v. Solowan
,
2008 SCC 62
to support the position that sentencing must
remain within the statutory range, even for summary conviction offences - they
are simply one of many factors to be weighed in determining a fit sentence
within that range. The Crown also questions whether Mr. Khant’s conduct was
truly anomalous, noting that he had previously used the acronym associated with
sex work and had engaged with sex workers before.
[
39
]
The Crown challenges the Defence’s suggestion
that a discharge or suspended sentence would be appropriate, arguing that
a criminal conviction carries necessary
deterrent value. They assert that Mr. Khant’s moral
blameworthiness is high, as he continued to engage in
the conversation even after being told the undercover officer was underage. The
Crown concludes that a discharge would be contrary
to the public interest and an affront to the
principle of parity, especially given the seriousness of the offence and the
offender’s degree of responsibility.
[
40
]
The Crown also relies on
R. v. Faroughi
,
2024 ONCA 178
. This case involved a 19-year-old first-time offender who was
convicted of child luring and communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual
services from a person under 18. The case arose from Project Raphael, a police
sting operation using online ads to catch individuals seeking underage sex
workers. The appellant responded to an ad, engaged in explicit communication
with an undercover officer posing as a 14-year-old, and was arrested upon
arrival at a hotel with the agreed payment.
[
41
]
At trial, the appellant was convicted by a jury.
The trial judge imposed concurrent sentences of seven months’ imprisonment,
rejecting a non-custodial sentence. The judge found the offences serious and
emphasized the need for denunciation and deterrence. Although the judge struck
down the one-year mandatory minimum for child luring as unconstitutional, he
did not address the six-month minimum for the communication offence, as the
imposed sentence exceeded it.
[
42
]
On appeal, the appellant challenged both his
conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the conviction appeal
but allowed the sentence appeal. The appellant submitted fresh evidence of
significant post-sentence developments, including:
•
Completion of an engineering degree
•
Founding a business
•
Onset of serious health issues requiring surgery
and ongoing therapy
[
43
]
The Court admitted this evidence, finding it
relevant and credible, and concluded it could have affected the sentencing
outcome.
[
44
]
The Court found that the trial judge failed to
properly consider the principle of restraint, particularly the availability of
a conditional sentence, given the change in the law that occurred after
sentencing. This was treated as an error in principle justifying appellate
intervention.
[
45
]
The Court imposed concurrent conditional
sentences of nine months, including house arrest for the first half. It held
that a conditional sentence could still meet the goals of denunciation and
deterrence, especially for a youthful first-time offender with strong
rehabilitative prospects.
[
46
]
The Court declared the six-month mandatory
minimum under s. 286.1(2)(a) unconstitutional as applied to the appellant,
finding it grossly disproportionate in light of his age, health, and
rehabilitative efforts. The Court emphasized that incarceration would undermine
his recovery and rehabilitation.
Analysis:
[
47
]
I start by noting that the Court in
Faroughi
did not consider a discharge or suspended sentence appropriate, even for a
youthful, first-time offender. It emphasized that custodial sentences are often
necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offence.
[
48
]
The Crown argues that if a discharge was not
appropriate in
Faroughi
, it is even less so in Mr. Khant’s case, where
the Crown has already offered a plea to a lesser offence. A discharge would
undermine public confidence and fail to meet the objectives of denunciation and
deterrence.
[
49
]
The
Faroughi
case can be distinguished as
supporting a more lenient sentence than the one imposed.  In contrast to the
serious and completed sexual offences in the
Faroughi
case, Mr. Khant
pleaded guilty to a significantly less serious offence—attempted indecent act—which
carries a lower maximum sentence and no mandatory minimum.
[
50
]
Moreover, in the
Faroughi
case, there
was clear and compelling evidence, including explicit text messages, confirmation
of the complainant’s age, and the accused arriving with the agreed-upon
payment. In contrast, Mr. Khant’s case was marked by evidentiary weaknesses—a
partial phone download, no direct link between the phone and Mr. Khant, and
surveillance footage that failed to show him at the hotel room door. These
gaps, along with the fact that the ad initially stated the woman was 18, could raise
entrapment concerns that were not present in
Faroughi
, further reducing
Mr. Khant’s moral blameworthiness.
[
51
]
Another key distinction lies in the collateral
consequences. Mr. Khant is a permanent resident seeking Canadian citizenship
and professional licensing. A conviction would not only delay his citizenship
by four years but could also prevent him from sponsoring his wife and obtaining
his engineering licence. These immigration and professional consequences are
far more severe than those faced by Mr. Faroughi, who was a Canadian citizen
with no such vulnerabilities. Courts have recognized that such consequences can
justify a more lenient sentence, including a discharge.
[
52
]
Additionally, Mr. Khant has demonstrated strong
rehabilitative efforts, including completing 12 counselling sessions and
receiving a low-risk assessment. While Mr. Faroughi also had positive
rehabilitative indicators, the Court still imposed a conditional sentence due
to the seriousness of the offence. Given that Mr. Khant’s offence is less
serious and his rehabilitation is well underway, a discharge would be more
appropriate and proportionate.
[
53
]
Finally, the Crown in
Faroughi
sought a
sentence within the 12–24-month range, and the Court imposed a nine-month
conditional sentence. In Mr. Khant’s case, the Crown is seeking only a 90-day
custodial sentence. If a conditional sentence was appropriate in
Faroughi
despite a higher sentencing range and more serious offence, then a
non-custodial sentence is even more justified in Mr. Khant’s circumstances,
where the offence is less serious, the sentence sought is shorter, and the
mitigating factors are substantial.
[
54
]
Mr. Khant presents with numerous mitigating
factors that support a lenient sentence. He is a first-time offender with no
prior criminal history.  He pleaded guilty. The Psychological Risk Assessments,
by Dr. Monik Kalia, indicate that he poses a low risk of reoffending and does
not exhibit any signs of deviant sexual interests or antisocial behaviour. He
has demonstrated genuine remorse and has taken proactive steps toward
rehabilitation, including completing 12 counselling sessions. His background is
marked by academic excellence and professional stability—he holds a Master’s
degree in civil engineering, is employed in a skilled role, and is on track to
become a licenced professional engineer. He also has strong family support and
a stable marriage.
[
55
]
Importantly, Mr. Khant faces severe collateral
consequences if convicted.
[
56
]
A criminal record would likely prevent him from
sponsoring his wife, who is on a work visa set to expire in September 2025,
potentially resulting in their separation. It would also delay his eligibility
for Canadian citizenship and jeopardize his professional licensing. In
R. v.
Pham
,
2013 SCC 15
, the Supreme Court of Canada held that immigration
consequences are a relevant and legitimate consideration in sentencing. The
case involved a non-citizen who received a two-year prison sentence, which
triggered automatic deportation under immigration law. The Court found that,
although the sentence fell within the statutory range, it failed to account for
the severe collateral consequence of deportation. As a result, the Court
reduced the sentence to two years less a day to preserve the offender’s right
to appeal the removal order. This decision affirmed that sentencing must be
individualized and proportionate, taking into account not only the offence and
the offender’s responsibility but also the broader impacts of the sentence,
including on immigration status. The
Pham
decision stands for the
principle that collateral consequences, while not determinative, can justify a
lower sentence within the legal range to avoid disproportionate hardship.
[
57
]
The offence itself technically was not
completed, and there was no physical contact or harm to a real person. The
Crown’s case had some evidentiary weaknesses, including a partial phone
download, a lack of direct evidence linking the phone to Mr. Khant, and gaps in
surveillance. These factors collectively support the appropriateness of a
discharge or conditional sentence.
[
58
]
Despite the mitigating circumstances, there are
aggravating factors that must be acknowledged. The offence involved an
attempted indecent act, which, while not completed, is inherently serious due
to its sexual nature and the potential for public harm. The Crown argues that
Mr. Khant continued to engage in the conversation even after being told the
undercover officer was underage, suggesting recklessness or indifference to the
age of the person he believed he was meeting. Additionally, the Crown points to
a statement made by Mr. Khant—“we could do this a lot depending on how this goes”—as
indicative of a possible intent to repeat the conduct.
[
59
]
The Crown also emphasizes the importance of
sentencing parity, noting that other individuals charged under Project Juno
received custodial sentences. A discharge, in their view, could undermine public
confidence in the justice system and fail to denounce the offence adequately.
These aggravating factors must be carefully weighed against the mitigating
circumstances to determine a proportionate and just sentence.
The Appropriate Sentence:
[
60
]
In my view, in these rare circumstances, custody
is not an appropriate sentence in Mr. Khant’s case due to a combination of
compelling mitigating factors that significantly reduce his moral
blameworthiness and support a rehabilitative approach.
[
61
]
I believe that imposing a conditional discharge
with 12 months of probation, which includes three months of house arrest with
exceptions, reflects a balanced and rehabilitative approach to sentencing. It
acknowledges Mr. Khant’s potential for reform, the absence of a prior criminal
record, and the necessity to avoid the long-term consequences of a conviction.
A conviction would lead to severe collateral consequences, such as jeopardizing
his immigration status, delaying his citizenship, and preventing him from
sponsoring his wife, which would likely result in their separation. These
consequences would be disproportionate to the offence and would undermine his
rehabilitative progress. Considering these factors, a custodial sentence would
be unduly harsh and contrary to the principles of proportionality, restraint,

promotes public safety, and provides structured support to encourage lawful
behaviour and successful reintegration into the community.
