for the accused Glenda Marie ESTEVES
Faria J.:
I.
Introduction
[
1
]
On September 12, 2022, the first day of her Preliminary Inquiry, Glenda
Esteves pled guilty to Fraud Over $5000, Uttering a Forged Document, and Committing
Theft Under False Pretenses, between January 2015 and October 2019.
[
2
]
The facts were agreed to, and the parties proceeded with a G
ardiner
[1]
hearing for the next 30 months. The dispute is whether the amount defrauded is
readily ascertainable and whether a fine in lieu should be ordered.
[
3
]
In addition to hearing evidence for several days over the course of the
two and half years, numerous adjournments were granted for numerous reasons: Ms.
Esteves gave late disclosure of “thousands of” pages to her lawyer; the
defendant was ill; counsel was ill; the witness mis-diarized; the parties
mis-diarized; schedules were challenging, and even the court required more time
to review the evidence.
[
4
]
The day has come, and these are my reasons for sentence.
II.
Agreed Facts
[
5
]
Between 2015 and 2019, Glenda Esteves operated an elaborate fraud.
[
6
]
She was the sole owner of “Mac Glamour Inc.” Both before and after she
incorporated this company, she enticed investors to invest in her venture with
high rates of return.
[
7
]
She purported to make and sell lipstick. She claimed to obtain materials
from MAC, a well-known cosmetics company, mix these materials, create her own lipstick,
and then sell these lipsticks to a modelling company called Q Modelling NYC. Ms.
Esteves claimed the profit margin was the difference between the cost of the
raw materials from MAC, and the sale price of the finished product to Q
Modelling.
[
8
]
The actual production of lipsticks did not exist. Ms. Esteves never made
lipsticks. The money investors provided her was never invested in the company called
Mac Glamour as she claimed.
[
9
]
Ms. Esteves obtained investment money by forging various banking
documents and used them to persuade investors that Mac Glamour had millions of
dollars in a corporate account. Mac Glamour had no such account.
[
10
]
These
forged bank documents eased investors who were owed money and persuaded them to
invest further amounts.
[
11
]
Money
that was paid out as an “investment return” was money received from other
investors. The business model was thereby operated as a Ponzi scheme.
[
12
]
Many
of the victims she targeted to invest in her company, and who became victims, were
from her ethnic community of Filipino origin.
[
13
]
The
total number of victims Ms. Esteves defrauded has never been quantified.
III.
Glenda
Esteves’ Circumstances
[
14
]
Born
in the Philippines in 1974, Ms. Esteves is an educated 50-year-old married
woman with two adult children.
[
15
]
Pursuant
to her Pre-Sentence Report (PSR), Ms. Esteves is the oldest of 8 siblings, 6 of
whom still live in the Philippines, while she cares for and provides for the
youngest sibling who lives with her in Toronto.  She grew up in poverty and
left her country of origin to make a better life for herself.
[
16
]
She
has a long-term supportive marriage. Her husband is a co-accused on these
charges, but whom she says she deceived and is not responsible for any
fraudulent conduct.  Her daughter has completed university and has a job. Her
son has just done the same.
[
17
]
Ms.
Esteves first immigrated to the United States where she continued her education
in Computer Science while her husband immigrated to Canada with the two
children in 2014. She joined them in Toronto, and shortly after that became a
Canadian citizen in 2019.
[
18
]
She
has been successfully employed, has no medical conditions, nor any substance
use issues.
[
19
]
In
2017 she registered Mac Glamour, the company through which she defrauded
people, and operated until her arrest in 2020.
[
20
]
The
author of the PSR notes that Ms. Esteves has lost support in her Filipino community
as many were her victims. She has become sad and depressed as a result,
decreasing her social interactions, and focusing on her family.
[
21
]
Ms.
Esteves admits she was in “full control of the operation” and “takes full
responsibility.”  When she addressed the court, she was remorseful.  She stated
that she progressed from borrowing money, accumulating debt, and then, when she
was unable to pay her loans, she started the elaborate scheme to obtain money. She
lied to people and her lies became bigger. She said she began to believe her
own lies which spiraled her out of control. She apologized to the victims, her
family and her community accepting the entirety of her blameworthiness.
IV.
Victim
Impact
[
22
]
The
Crown filed 22 victim impact statements from 24 victims.  Reading these
statements is to read a litany of heartache and hardship, broken promises and broken
dreams, deep betrayal, and significant financial loss.  The impact has been
wide-ranging, including not only negative economic consequences, but psychological
damage so severe that some victims became physically ill.
[
23
]
The
amounts, from as low as $8,750 to as high as $273,578.15, were the life savings
they lost, or the debts they incurred to invest and are now liable to pay for. Their
voices deserve to be heard:
i.
Anthony Wang lost his savings which made him unable to buy a home for
his 6-person family. They were all forced to live in an 800 sq foot apartment
during the pandemic. He had to move to Alberta to be able to afford a home. He
became physically ill and developed a medical condition that cost him financially
and made him miss work. He does not trust his own family anymore as they were
the ones who invited him into the scheme.
ii.
Bonifacio Sales, a university student at the time, was recruited by Ms.
Esteves’ niece. He lost his savings and his girlfriend’s savings. His grades
went down, he became ill, and feels traumatized, embarrassed, and scared of
people.
iii.
Christine Magno was unable to afford the flight to see her father for a
final time, or to settle his hospital bills and pay for his funeral. She begged
for her money back and never got it.
iv.
Darwin Aguilera has been traumatized and does not trust people with
money.
v.
Daryl Desouza’s relationship with his wife, both his parents and his
younger brother, all who invested their life savings with Ms. Esteves, has
deteriorated. They all have to work harder to pay their bills and are unable to
pay for the “extras” such as physiotherapy and home maintenance, which are not
extras at all.
vi.
David Yao is paying interest on the loan he took out to invest with Ms.
Esteves in addition to his initial loss.
vii.
Delmar Villamor lost the money he was investing for his son. He lost his
home, his car, and his job because he became too anxious to work. He is now
living with family and struggling with alcoholism.
viii.
Ellen Grace Calla struggles with shame for persuading others to invest with
Ms. Esteves. She has developed physical symptoms of stress and is paying off
the loan she borrowed from family to invest with Ms. Esteves.
ix.
Gloria Natividad was defrauded of the money she was saving to support
her daughter with severe disabilities.
x.
Jerone Martinez’s financial loss has caused him depression and stained
his relationship with his wife.
xi.
Luz Marina Estrada became a despondent recluse after she was defrauded
of her life savings. She had to downsize her apartment and give up her dream of
buying a home for herself and her son. She is afraid and has lost trust in
everyone.
xii.
Marial Lailani de Leon invested her own money, borrowed money at the
request of Ms. Esteves to invest, and persuaded her employer and family to
invest with Ms. Esteves.  Not only was she defrauded, but she was sued by her
employer who also invested, and for whom she must continue to work for because
she has no other options. She experienced serious suicidal ideation.
xiii.
Maribel Bulatao, working for minimum wage, and living pay cheque to pay
cheque was defrauded of her life savings, that was going to be the down payment
for a home she will never own.
xiv.
Maryna Karpenko was defrauded of her father’s pension money and her
inheritance which was meant for her to buy a home. She required mental health
help and is now working double shifts to be able to pay her bills. She feels
guilt that she was duped and lost her father’s legacy for her.
xv.
Noemi Arizo and her husband now work extra shifts and will retire later
than expected, in order to pay the interest on the loan they took to invest
with Ms. Esteves.
xvi.
Nomelita & Reychard Laguisma borrowed on the equity of their home
from a private mortgage to invest with Ms. Esteves. Their family and friends
invested and lost their investments as well. They are now working all the time
to pay the interest on the loan and have lost those relationships. They can no
longer afford their children’s extra-curricular activities and family
vacations.
xvii.
Precious Jade Darang, the mother of three, borrowed money to invest with
Ms. Esteves. She was evicted after she was defrauded.
xviii.
Roliynada and Michael Aduca now work 7 days a week, and double shifts to
pay their increased mortgage as they had to refinance their home.
xix.
Roman Dzyuba became bankrupt. He persuaded his widowed mother to invest
his father’s insurance money after his death.  She now has no retirement funds.
He feels shame, guilt and unbearable pain that requires him to go to
psychotherapy.
xx.
Virginia Aduca had to sell her home and her close relationships have all
suffered.
xxi.
Vishal Gandhi, a single father, cannot afford to get help for his
depression, his problem with alcohol and his fear of being defrauded again. He
is now in debt and unable to work or function as a result of his victimization.
xxii.
Yvanna Shane Laurilla became paralyzed with anxiety, unable to get out
of bed. She blamed herself, became isolated and unable to speak to anyone about
her victimization. She missed work and is now in debt.
V.
Legal
Principles
[
24
]
Sections
718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
guide judges with the sentencing task.
[
25
]
Every
sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.
[
26
]
The
sanction must have one or more of the following objectives:
•
to denounce unlawful conduct;
•
to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;
•
to separate offenders from society, where necessary;
•
to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
•
to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community;
•
and to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.
[
27
]
In arriving at a fit sentence, the Court must consider the
principles of restraint, as well as
ss. 718.2
(c) to (e), and parity,
s.
718.2
(b). A sentence must also consider relevant aggravating and mitigating
factors,
s. 718.2
(a).
[
28
]
Section.
462.37(3) states:
Fine
instead
of forfeiture
(3)
If
a court is satisfied that an order of forfeiture under subsection (1) or (2.01)
should be made
in
respect of any property
of an offender but that the property or any part of or interest
in
the property cannot be made subject to an order,
the court may, instead of ordering the property or any part of or
interest
in
the property to be forfeited,
order the offender to pay a
fine
in
an amount equal to the value of the property or
the part of or interest
in
the
property.
In
particular, a court may order
the offender to pay a
fine
if the property
or any part of or interest
in
the
property:
(a)
cannot,
on the exercise of due diligence, be located;
(b)
has
been transferred to a third party;
(c)
is
located outside Canada;
(d)
has
been substantially diminished in value or rendered worthless; or
(e)
has
been commingled with other property that cannot be divided without difficulty
Imprisonment
in
default of payment of
fine
(4)
Where
a court orders an offender to pay a
fine
pursuant
to subsection (3), the court shall
(a)
impose,
in
default of payment of that
fine
, a term of imprisonment
(vii)
of
not less than five years and not exceeding ten years, where the amount of
the
fine
exceeds one million dollars; and
(b)
direct
that the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (a) be served
consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the offender or that
the offender is then serving.
[
29
]
A fine in lieu of forfeiture thus carries with
it, the risk of a jail term on a sliding scale commensurate with the amount of
the fine.
[
30
]
Section
738(1)(a) governs the making of restitution orders.  It provides the court
discretion to order the offender to make restitution by paying the victims
"an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the
property as of the date the order is imposed, less the value of any part of the
property that is returned, where the amount is readily ascertainable”.
[
31
]
Where there are disputed facts, such as the quantum of
the loss, the Crown must prove the relevant aggravating facts beyond a
reasonable doubt, pursuant to ss. 724(3)(e) and
R. v. Gardiner
.
VI.
Position
of the Parties
[
32
]
The
parties jointly recommend 4 years in the penitentiary.
[
33
]
The
Crown seeks a fine in lieu of the total amount of $4,998,831.78 based on Form
34.1 documents filed and the evidence of a witness.
[
34
]
Though
Ms. Esteves agrees she defrauded victims of at least $250,000, Mr. Reynolds for
Ms. Esteves submits the Crown did not demonstrate any of the amounts on any of
the Form 34.1 from any of the victims were accurate and reliable and neither
was the evidence of the Crown witness.  Therefore, he submits there is no
“readily ascertainable” amounts, and no fine in lieu should be ordered.
VII.
ANALYSIS
A.
Aggravating Factors
[
35
]
The
aggravating factors include:
(i)
Ms. Esteves developed a very sophisticated scheme that required
extensive planning to execute. She created an elaborate business that consisted
of a company for source materials, her expertise in lipstick creation, and a
buyer for her product. She substantiated her scheme with contracts, fraudulent
banking documents and complex processes.
(ii)
She sustained the fraudulent scheme for 4 years.
(iii)
Ms. Esteves lured a large number of victims, only some of which were
located.
(iv)
The impact of her crimes on the victims is long lasting, and wide ranging.
Not only were victims financially ruined, but their personal relationships
became strained, their employment negatively impacted and even their health was
affected.  Some victims developed medical conditions requiring medication and
psychotherapy, and some became ill to the point of suicidal ideation and
becoming alcoholic.  Some will never recover.
(v)
Many of the victims were targeted and victimized because of their
connection to Ms. Esteves as a member of her Filipino community, and even as
personal friends and family. This breach of their trust had a significant
impact on their ability to trust people going forward.
(vi)
Although Ms. Esteves explained her initial motivation was desperation to
pay a debt, it soon became greed and self-indulgent grandiosity when she
started to defraud people using false documents.  She simply wanted more money than
she could acquire honestly.
B.
Mitigating Factors
[
36
]
The
mitigating factors include:
(i)
Ms. Esteves is a first-time offender with no criminal record.
(ii)
She has a pro-social history with consistent employment and family
support.
(iii)
She plead guilty which demonstrates accountability. The Crown’s case was
a strong one, and her plea was not an early one. She entered it on the first
day of the scheduled preliminary hearing. The sentencing has proceeded over a
long period of time, and although she saved the victims from having to testify,
the benefit to the system’s resources is attenuated.
(iv)
During her allocution, Ms. Esteves did display remorse, did apologize to
all those she harmed and did seem to have some sense of the devastation she
caused because she has been ostracized from her community, her friends, and her
own life has been significantly impacted.
C.
Jurisprudence
[
37
]
Sentencing
principles do not include a principle of revenge. Offenders are not
incarcerated to establish an equivalence between the loss victims experienced
and the sanction imposed by the court. Rather, the court is required to
recognize the inherent worth and dignity of the offender and, balance the
principles provided by the
Criminal Code
to determine a fit sentence in
the circumstances of the case.
[2]
[
38
]
The purpose of a fine in lieu of forfeiture is
to replace the proceeds of crime so that an offender does not benefit from
criminal conduct, rather than to punish the offender.
[3]
[
39
]
It is an error to decline to order a fine in
lieu of forfeiture out of concern for the accused's rehabilitative prospects
and ability to satisfy restitution orders made against her.
[4]
[
40
]
The ability to pay is not the predominant
factor. Where the circumstances of the offence are particularly egregious, a
restitution order may be made even where there does not appear to be any
likelihood of repayment.
[5]
[
41
]
The circumstances of this case are clearly
egregious.
[
42
]
The starting point for any
discussion of the objectives and factors that inform the exercise of discretion
in making a restitution order is
Castro
[6]
and
Zelensky.
[7]
[
43
]
While these decisions deal with predecessor
legislation, they nevertheless serve as a blueprint for what is to be considered
in making a restitution order under s. 738(1).  I also take them to be guiding
principles in the exercise of discretion under s. 432.67 (3). The discretion
applies to the decision whether to impose a fine and to the determination of
the value of the property.
[8]
[
44
]
No single factor is itself
determinative of whether a compensation order should be
granted and the weight to be given to individual considerations will depend
on the circumstances of each case. Those
circumstances include two considerations that were emphasized by the Court
in
Castro
:
the nature of the offence and, when money has been taken, what has happened to
the money.
[
45
]
The
statutory pre-requisite to any restitution order is that it
must be readily
ascertainable, (
Castro
, at para.
24
relying on
Zelensky
) and the
court must consider the following in its exercise of discretion:
1
.
An order for compensation should be made with
restraint and caution;
2. The concept of
compensation is essential to the sentencing process:
(i) it emphasizes the sanction imposed upon the offender;
(ii) it makes the accused responsible for making restitution to the
victim;
(iii) it prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and
(iv) it provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery
for the victim;
3. A sentencing
judge should consider:
(i) the
purpose of the aggrieved person in invoking s. 725(1);
(ii) whether civil proceedings have been
initiated and are being   pursued;
(iii) the means of the offender.
4. A compensation
order should not be used as a substitute for civil proceedings. Parliament did
not intend that compensation orders would displace the civil remedies necessary
to ensure full compensation to victims.
5. A compensation
order is not the appropriate mechanism to unravel involved commercial
transactions;
6. A compensation
order should not be granted when it would require the criminal court to
interpret written documents to determine the amount of money sought through the
order. The loss should be capable of ready calculation.
7. A compensation
order should not be granted if the effect of provincial legislation would have
to be considered in order to determine what order should be made;
8. Any serious
contest on legal or factual issues should signal a denial of recourse to an
order;
9. Double recovery
can be prevented by the jurisdiction of the civil courts to require proper
accounting of all sums recovered; and
10. A compensation
order may be appropriate where a related civil judgment has been rendered
unenforceable because of bankruptcy.
D.
Summary of Evidence & Findings of Fact
[
46
]
The
Crown filed a Form 34.1 from 29 victims as exhibits
[9]
totaling $2,416,589.28.
[
47
]
The
only witness, Brian Wang, provided a list of victims and the amounts he
believed each victim was defrauded.  This amounted to $2, 582, 242. 50.
[10]
[
48
]
The
Crown thus submits it has filed credible and reliable evidence and proven
beyond a reasonable doubt the total loss is $4,998,831.78 for which a fine in
lieu should be made.
[
49
]
There
is no dispute, on the evidence filed and heard, and admitted, that all the
money, from all the victims defrauded, flowed to, and/or through the hands of
Glenda Esteves over the entire 4-year period of her fraudulent scheme.
[
50
]
I
find Ms. Esteves is entirely responsible for the financial loss of every victim
of her fraudulent scheme.  She was the sole beneficiary of the millions of
dollars she fraudulently obtained.  The location of the money is unknown.
The evidence of Brian Wang
[
51
]
The
Crown submits Mr. Wang was credible and reliable. His evidence should be accepted,
and the court can rely on the accuracy of his list.
[
52
]
The
Defence takes the opposing view that his evidence is neither credible nor
reliable for the purpose of determining specific amounts specific victims were
defrauded, and he is not to be believed.
[
53
]
Mr.
Wang admitted he was heavily involved in recruiting his friends, family, and
people he knew to invest in the Mac Glamour enterprise and Ms. Esteves. He
played a key role in her scheme and explained how he assisted her to obtain
investments, create documents and grew, what he thought, was a legitimate
organization. He admitted the investment returns were higher than any other
regular investment. He admitted he was greedy.  He was detailed about the
evolution of his role within Ms. Esteves’s scheme. He was forthright about his
growing concerns, his financial loss, as well as how he became implicated in
her scheme. He described how he came to doubt Ms. Esteves, and how he began to
realize he had been duped.  Finally, Mr. Wang admitted to threatening Ms.
Esteves that he would go to the police in the hopes that she would return the
money obtained from the investors whom she had defrauded. He ultimately did go
to police and co-operated with the investigation of Glenda Esteves.
[
54
]
Mr.
Wang testified over the course of several days on the
Gardiner
Hearing
and was subject to lengthy cross-examination.  I find he testified openly and
with candour.
[
55
]
I
find Mr. Wang credible. He confirmed what Ms. Esteves admitted. All the money that
was defrauded flowed to Ms. Esteves, and only Ms. Esteves. He does not know
what she did with the millions that flowed through her hands and lost all the
money he himself gave her, as “investments”.
[
56
]
Mr.
Wang created a list of individuals and their losses. He provided the list to
police and the court. The list is comprised of both victims for whom the Crown
filed a Form 34.1, and for victims for whom the Crown did not file a Form
34.1.  He included his own loss that he estimated to be “at least $500,000”.  He
listed a loss of $2,582,242.50.
[
57
]
However,
Mr. Wang repeatedly testified this list was created to the best of his
knowledge but was not accurate. He repeatedly testified each victim was
responsible for providing the court with the evidence of their own loss.
[
58
]
As
a result, I find Mr. Wang’s list of victims, and the amounts of their loss, to
be, as he testified, not accurate and not reliable.
[
59
]
I
therefore reject the Crown’s submission that this list attributing the loss $2,582,242.50
to various people should be relied on. It is of no assistance on the point.
[
60
]
The
victims named by Mr. Wang, though they likely did sustain a financial loss at
the hands of Ms. Esteves, Mr. Wang’s evidence is insufficient and does not meet
the Crown’s required burden at this
Gardiner
hearing for any restitution
or fine in lieu be issued.
[
61
]
I
also reject the submission that any inconsistency between Mr. Wang’s list and
the information victims filed in the form of a Form 34.1, undermines the
reliability of the information on the Form 34.1, for the same reason.
[
62
]
Mr.
Wang’s list was never intended to be a precise and reliable document. That his
numbers are not consistent with the Form 34.1 information filed by victims is
of no consequence.
Readily Ascertainable losses
Brian Wang
[
63
]
Mr.
Wang did not sign a Form 34.1. He did not testify to his own specific quantum
of loss, but rather repeatedly stated “at least” when describing the amounts of
money he personally invested with no details as to those amounts.
[
64
]
As
a result, Mr. Wang’s specific loss is not readily ascertainable, and no fine in
lieu will issue for his financial loss.
Form 34.1
[
65
]
The
Crown submits that each amount on each Form 34.1 filed is accurate and
reliable, and thus the court can find the readily ascertainable total amount of
  $2,416,589.28 was lost and a fine in lieu of that amount listing the
respective losses of each victim should issue.
[
66
]
The
Defence submits that the amounts claimed on the Form 34.1s filed are not reliable
as they provide insufficient documentation, or information.
[
67
]
I
accept that all the victims who filed a Form 34.1 and made a claim as to the
amount Ms. Esteves defrauded them to be credible. Many of the victim impact
statements provide further information and details that substantiate the claims
of financial loss.
[
68

The
Crown did not obtain and file much of the documentation referred to by victims
in either their Form 34.1, and, or their Victim Impact Statements.
[
69
]
In
fact, the victims may very well still have documentation to assert a valid
claim for their loss in another forum.
[
70
]
Most
of the Form 34.1 filed only refer to bottom line losses. Some refer to the type
of “investment” or “loan”. Many refer to specific dates the funds were provided
to Ms. Esteves. Some go into detail even to the point of exact amounts, from
what bank, and in what manner the funds were provided. This information leads
to the conclusion these victims have the documentation to support their claim.
However, these documents were not filed at the hearing.
[

]
As
the Ontario Court of Appeal stated in
Devgan
[11]
summarizing the objectives in
Zelensky
,
the loss should be capable
of ready calculation, and without these documents this court is unable to
ascertain the loss at this time and is unable to issue a fine in lieu.
[

]
This
finding pertains to the following victims:
(i)
Christine Magno’s Form 34.1 is unsigned. It is dated January 27, 2023, and
claims a loss of $100,000 as “Money Glenda taken from myself” and $5,000 from
“my partner”.  The lack of signature, the absence of details, and the unnamed partner
are fatal flaws.
(ii)
Gloria Natividad provided a signed Form 34.1 dated February 9, 2023,
claiming the loss of $25,000 as a “cash investment” with no further documentation.
(iii)
Both Jerome Ariel Martinez and Norma Martinez signed a Form 34.1 on
January 14, 2023, claiming a “monetary loss” of $25,000.00 with no further documentation.
(iv)
Maryna Karpenko signed a Form 34.1 on February 5, 2023, claiming the
loss of $118, 000.00 with a notation it is the “total loss of investment” with no
further documentation.
(v)
Rollynda and Michael Aduca signed a Form 34.1 on February 2, 2023,
claiming $81,323.02 as a “loan to ‘Mac Glamour’ and Glenda Marie Esteves and
B+E Investments” with no further documentation.
(vi)
Roman Dzyuba signed a Form 34.1 on February 5, 2023, claiming the “total
amount of invested money less interest paid out” to be $147,000 with no further
documentation.
(vii)
Vishal Ghandhi signed a Form 34.1 on January 16, 2023, claiming
$273,578.15 with no further documentation.
(viii)
Bonifacio B. Sales III signed a Form 34.1 on February 11, 2023, claiming
$20,000 for himself as “personal money invested and not returned” and $15,000
on behalf of his girlfriend, Maria Ysabelle Mariscal, who “invested money and
not returned”. Ms. Mariscal did not sign the Form. Neither party provided further
documentation.
(ix)
Delmar Villamor signed a Form 34.1 on February 13, 2023, claiming “money
estimated”, “car estimated” and “other jewelry” to be $89,999, $45,000, and
$20,000. Each amount was admittedly only estimated with no documentation.
(x)
Ellen Grace Calla signed a Form 34.1 on February 14, 2023, claiming an
$80,000 loss as “amount invested” with no further documentation.
(xi)
Luz Marina Estrada signed a Form 34.1 on April 22, 2023, claiming the
loss of $57,624.11 without providing further documentation.
(xii)
Maria Lailani de Leon signed a Form 34.1 claiming a loss of $10,000 from
“savings account withdrawn”, $60,000 “line of credit”, $6,302.58 “lawyers fee”
and $20,000 for “settlement amount to lawsuit (Caruana et al)” and claims a
total $551,527.00 loss. The specificity of these amounts, particularly in
regard to the amounts eligible for claim, such as withdrawn amounts, and those
withdrawn from a credit line refer to specific documentation, but it was not
provided.
(xiii)
Virginia Aduca signed a Form 34.1 claiming a $200,000 loss as “money
from the equity of our former residence”. The source of the funds is identified
and thus likely easily documented, but the documentation was not provided.
(xiv)
Yvanna Shane Laurilla signed a Form 34.1 claiming a $25,000 loss for a
“loan” to Glenda Esteves with no documentation.
[
73
]
Some
victims who signed a Form 34.1 refer to specific dates that funds were provided
to Ms. Esteves, but the Crown did not file the supporting documentation and a
fine in lieu cannot issue.  This finding pertains to:
i.
Alan Yao signed a Form 34.1 dated January 29, 2023, claiming the loss of
an investment to Glenda Esteves of $150,000 made on January 15, 2019.
ii.
Anthony Wang signed a Form 34.1 dated January 16, 2023, claiming a loss
of $58,757.50 for an investment made on March 2, 2019.
[12]
iii.
David Yao signed Form 34.1 dated January 29, 2023, claiming $100,000.00
for an investment loan made to Glenda Esteves on October 29, 2018.
iv.
Noemi Arizo signed a Form 34.1 dated January 23, 2023, claiming the loss
of $130,000 as “investment amount provided on July 6, 2018”.
v.
Yu Ling Luo signed a Form 34.1 dated January 16, 2023, claiming the loss
of $58,757.50 for an “investment loan” made on March 2, 2019.
vi.
It is particularly noteworthy that Guadalupe Gonzaga signed a Form 34.1
dated February 7, 2023, claiming $16,000 with the specific details of the
amounts, the nature of the amounts, the dates the amounts were deposited and
the bank used that the Crown did not obtain documentation for:
a.
$3000.00 cash
deposited on March 18, 2017 at TD Bank.
b.
$4000.00 cash
deposited on August 22, 2017 at the TD Bank.
c.
$5000.00 cash
deposited on November 25, 2017 at the TD Bank.
d.
$2000.00 cash
deposited on December 9, 2017 at the TD Bank
e.
$2000.00
e-transfer on May 16, 2017.
[
74
]
The
remaining victims for whom a Form 34.1 was filed do provide sufficient details
in the contracts either provided or testified to by Brian Wang to support a ready
calculation of the loss and a fine in lieu will issue.
[
75
]
This
finding pertains to:
i.
Darwin Aguilera signed Form 34.1 dated February 5, 2023, claiming
$113,356
for which he provided an attached loan agreement and referred to Article 2 for
$83, 350 and a loan agreement in Article 5 for $30,000, specifically noting he
only included what was in the contract.
ii.
Daryl Desousa provided a signed Form 34.1 dated January 27, 2023,
which itemized his
$200,000
loss with specific bank draft numbers as
follows:
a.
Loan amount invested with “Glenda Esteves” and “Mac Glamour Inc” and “B
+E” Investment Inc” on February 9, 2019, by Bank Draft #83897519 in the amount
of $60,000.00
b.
Loan amount
invested with “Glenda Esteves” and “Mac Glamour Inc” and “B +E” Investment Inc”
on February 9, 2019, by Bank Draft #83897520 in the amount of $60,000.00
c.
Loan amount
invested with “Glenda Esteves” and “Mac Glamour Inc” and “B +E” Investment Inc”

loss for a “cash investment” of
$20,000
, and provided her Agreement
dated March 25, 2019, with the specific loan amount to be $26,801. 91, which
related to the complicated “fee” structure Mr. Wang testified to. The document
was signed by the parties.
iv.
Normelita Laguisma and Reychard Laguisam signed a Form 34.1 dated
February 2, 2023, claiming
$210,000
in “invested funds/money” and provided
 “attached are the loan/investment agreement and Ts.”
v.
Aaron Tiu and Felonila Tiu provided agreements claiming the total loss
of
$67,500
broken down as follows:

25, 2019, for May 31, 2019 (Article 2)
c.
$25,000 cheque
on May 14, 2019, for May 20, 2019 (Article 2) with an acknowledged receipt.

These
are ascertainable amounts totaling
$610,856.00.
VIII.Sentence
[
77
]
The
joint submission of 4 years is on the more lenient side for these offences that
have devastated so many.  However, as it is a joint submission by experienced counsel,
and it is within the range, I will accede to it.
[
78
]
The
sentence will be a 4-year penitentiary jail term apportioned as follows:
Count 4: Fraud over $5000, s.
380: 4 years jail.
Count 1: Forged document
s. 368(1)(a), 3 years jail concurrent to count 4.
Count 5: Utter false
document s. 362(1)(d), 3 years jail concurrent to count 4.
[
79
]
Pursuant
to
s. 462.37(3)
of the
Criminal Code
, Ms. Esteves is ordered to pay a
fine of $610,856.00. In default of payment, pursuant to s. 462.37(4) she shall
serve a sentence of 18 months imprisonment if she does not pay the fine within 5
years, calculated from the date of the expiry of the warrant committing her to
prison to serve her sentence.
[

She
will pay the victim fine surcharge for each of the counts.
