C.A. Brannagan J.:
1
.
Aswin Sajeevan was a co-resident with 11
other people at a home in Barrie. His bedroom was in the basement, next to a
laundry room, which in turn was next to a bathroom. That bathroom was primarily
used by the women who lived in the residence. Soon after the group moved in, in
August of 2024, they discovered a “peep hole” between the laundry room and the
bathroom. It was patched over. Someone uncovered the patch job. The hole was
covered and uncovered on more than one occasion. It is not known who continually
uncovered the “peep hole”.
2
.
What is known is that Mr. Sajeevan
repeatedly used that “peep hole” to surreptitiously observe – and video record
– four of his female roommates while they used the bathroom in various states
of undress. This offending continued for a period of six months.
3
.
On July 17, 2025, Mr. Sajeevan pleaded
guilty before me to four counts of voyeurism, contrary to
s. 162(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
.
4
.
These are my reasons for sentence.
I.          OVERVIEW
/ PROCEDURAL HISTORY
5
.
This case came before me in a regular plea court
in Barrie on July 17, 2025. Mr. Sajeevan was, and remains, represented by experienced
Counsel.
6
.
Before his arraignment, I learned that Mr.
Sajeevan was an Indian citizen in Canada on a student visa. I conducted a
thorough plea inquiry with him into the potential for immigration consequences;
the defendant, in his own words and through his Counsel, confirmed that he
wished to proceed despite not having received legal advice from an immigration
professional: s. 606(1.1);
R. v. Wong
,
2018 SCC 25
.
7
.
Mr. Sajeevan was arraigned and the hearing
proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts. The lawyers did not present
the court with a joint submission on sentence, though they agreed that the
sentence should include a period of custody, served in the community, followed
by probation. The Crown sought a conditional sentence order in the range of 12
months. Counsel sought a conditional sentence order in the range of four months.
8
.
After I heard submissions from the parties, I
cautioned them that I was considering a truly custodial disposition. I invited
further submissions from the parties and invited Mr. Sajeevan to withdraw his
plea, though I was not required to do so:
R. v. Nahanee
,
2022 SCC 37
, at
paras.
45-47
. These offers were declined. I then ordered a pre-sentence report,
before allocution.
9
.
Two months passed before this case was next
before me on September 19, 2025. The pre-sentence report was finalized and
distributed to the parties two days earlier. On the 19
th
, Counsel
for Mr. Sajeevan conceded admissibility of the report. He also advised the
court that he was adjusting his original position and was now joining the Crown
in its submission for a 12-month conditional sentence order.
10
.
Given the change in Counsel’s position, and a
busy court docket, I adjourned the matter to October 2, 2025, for sentencing.
11
.
In the interim, on September 22
nd
,
pursuant to the principles articulated in
R. v. Anthony-Cook
,
2016 SCC
43
, I invited written submissions from both litigants about how, in their view,
the test in s. 742.1(a) was met. I also invited submissions on the pre-sentence
report.
12
.
I received written submissions
from the Crown, along with two cases in support of its position. I did not
receive any written submissions on behalf of Mr. Sajeevan.
II.        FACTS / CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE
13
.
The offence of Voyeurism is found at
s. 162
of
the
Criminal Code
. It reads:
162. (1) Every one commits an offence who,
surreptitiously, observes – including by mechanical or electronic means – or
makes a visual recording of a person who is in circumstances that give rise to
a reasonable expectation of privacy, if
(a)
the person is in a place in which a person
can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or
anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity;
(b)
the person is nude, is exposing his or her
genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual
activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing
or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity; or
(c)
the observation or recording is done for a
sexual purpose.
[…]
(5) Every one who
commits an offence under subsection (1) or (4)
(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or
(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.
14
.
The Crown elected to proceed by way of summary
conviction. The maximum term of imprisonment available for each summary
conviction offence is two years less one day:
Criminal Code
, s. 787(1).
15
.
The agreed statement of facts that were read
into the record are as follows:
i.
Mr. Sajeevan resided at an address in Barrie
with 11 other roommates. All the tenants moved in around August of 2024.
ii.
Mr. Sajeevan had a bedroom in the basement. His
bedroom was adjacent to a laundry room which was, in turn, adjacent to a bathroom.
iii.
The residence had three bathrooms. The basement
bathroom near Mr. Sajeevan’s quarters was the bathroom that was principally
used by the female tenants.
iv.
On March 13, 2025, at around midnight, one of
the male tenants, D.D., along with the four female victims in this case – S.S.,
A.S., D.B., and N.P, attended at the Barrie Police Station to report a case of
voyeurism.
v.
The five complainants advised police that around
3:30 PM on March 11, 2025, D.D. found the accused, Aswin Sajeevan, crouched
down in the laundry room, with the light off, peering through a “peep hole” in
the wall into the bathroom. At that time, S.S. was naked using the facilities.
vi.
D.D. confronted Mr. Sajeevan about what he was
doing. Mr. Sajeevan adamantly denied any wrongdoing. He told D.D. that he was
searching for his earbuds. When D.D. queried why Mr. Sajeevan would be
searching for his earbuds in the dark, with the lights off, Mr. Sajeevan was
unable to provide an explanation.
vii.
D.D. advised S.S. about his interaction with Mr.
Sajeevan, and then told the other roommates, who ultimately decided to confront
the defendant about his behaviour.
viii.
The following day, on March 12, 2025, all the
tenants confronted Mr. Sajeevan about his conduct. Though he had initially
denied any wrongdoing, he eventually admitted to his housemates that he had
been watching them use the facilities in various states of undress at different
times through the hole in the laundry room.
ix.
Mr. Sajeevan showed his roommates video
recordings that he had made, using his cell phone and his laptop, of his female
roommates in various states of undress while they used the bathroom. I was not
told how many videos there were.
x.
Each of the victims in this case – S.S., A.S.,
D.B., and N.P – observed the recordings and was able to identify themselves as
the compromised subjects of the recordings.
xi.
The group deleted the recordings from Mr.
Sajeevan’s devices in fear that they would be disseminated by him. They seized
possession of his electronic devices and presented them to the police, who in
turn took those devices into their custody.
xii.
The police took audio statements from the five
complainants. Police learned that the hole in the wall between the laundry room
and the bathroom used by the female tenants was discovered soon after the
tenants moved into the residence in August.
xiii.
The hole had been patched up on more than one
occasion, only to have been uncovered each time. This raised suspicions in the
house. Those suspicions turned to Mr. Sajeevan, who had been seen on numerous
occasions entering the laundry room shortly after any of the females had
entered the bathroom.
xiv.
Police attended at the residence and confirmed
the existence of the laundry room “peep hole”. It offered a clear view from the
laundry room into the bathroom.
xv.
Mr. Sajeevan’s offending persisted over the
course of six months, from September 2024 to mid-March 2025, until he was
caught in the act.
III.       CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER
i.    Counsel’s Submissions
16
.
I was advised by Counsel for Mr. Sajeevan that
his client is a 20-year-old man from Kerala, India. He is in Canada on a
student visa.
17
.
I was told that Mr. Sajeevan fluently speaks
four languages. His lawyer referred to him as “a very gifted linguist”.
18
.
Mr. Sajeevan has a grade 12 education. He works in
Canada as a cook in a restaurant.
19
.
I wished to learn more about Mr. Sajeevan and
therefore ordered a pre-sentence report.
ii.   The Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”).
20
.
The purpose of a PSR is to provide the
sentencing court with information about “the offender’s age, maturity,
character, behaviour, attitude and willingness to make amends.” Its function is
to assist the court in imposing a sentence by portraying the offender’s background,
character and circumstances:
Criminal Code
, s. 721(1) & (3);
R.
v. Green
,
2006 ONCJ 364
, at paras.
12-13
;
R. v. Angelillo
,
2006 SCC
55
, at para.
18
.
21
.
Mr. Sajeevan’s PSR is unremarkable. It confirms
that he is 20 years of age, in Canada on a student visa that expires in
December of 2025, and that he is currently employed in Barrie as a line cook.
It indicates that he attended college in Canada for computer programming but
was suspended due to a low GPA.
22
.
The PSR reports that Mr. Sajeevan has no
diagnosed mental health issues. He does not suffer from any addiction issues.
He has limited local supports but maintains regular contact with his family in
India, with whom he has positive historical and ongoing relations. He keeps
contact with friends in India, using social media and virtual applications.
23
.
Mr. Sajeevan self-reported that he currently
resides in a residence in Barrie with several other men, who he says are from
Nigeria. He reported having a good relationship with his roommates but declined
to provide contact information for them. He told the PSR author that there were
no women renting in the home. None of this was independently verified.
24
.
Mr. Sajeevan told the PSR author that he was
“curious”, and he looked through the hole in the wall to see into the bathroom.
He explained to the writer that when he was looking through the peephole, “he
was excited to see the female roommates and his curiosity fuelled his
excitement leading him to feel guilty.”
25
.
The PSR indicates that Mr. Sajeevan expressed
guilt and remorse for his actions, after having read the four victim impact
statements. At the same time, the PSR also indicates that he appeared to lack
insight into the seriousness of his offending. Mr. Sajeevan’s father – a police
constable – confirmed that “this charge exists in India, and a person would be
held accountable for it here as well.”
IV.       VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS
26
.
In determining a fit sentence to be imposed on
an offender,
section 722
of the
Criminal Code
requires the court to
consider the harm suffered by victims of crime and the impact of the offence on
victims through victim impact statements (“VIS”).
27
.
While the VIS is a factor for the sentencing
judge to consider, it “should not overwhelm a sentencing decision”:
R. v.
Fraser
,
2016 ONCA 745
, at para.
30
.
28
.
Four victim impact statements were filed by the
Crown in this case, one by each of Mr. Sajeevan’s four victims: (i) S.S.; (ii)
A.S.; (iii) D.B.; and (iv) N.P. Brief summaries of each victim impact statement
follow:
i.
S.S.:
Since
learning of Mr. Sajeevan’s crimes, S.S. has been living with intense fear and
anxiety. She avoids using public washrooms. She has lost trust in friends. She
“felt like [she] was living in a nightmare, and it truly felt like hell.” She
described that she had to take time off work, and that the fear and emotional
distress arising from her victimization has made it difficult to function
normally. She noted the significant breach of trust, in that Mr. Sajeevan “was
capable of doing this to his own housemate, someone he lived with for two
years”.
ii.
A.S.:
A.S.
communicated that she does not feel emotionally safe around men, and that these
crimes have made it “very hard to trust people now, even [her] loved ones.” She
fears using public washrooms and those in her workplace, and she actively looks
for hidden cameras in them. A.S. blames herself for Mr. Sajeevan’s violations
of her privacy, dignity, and safety. She struggles with anxiety and fear that
she is constantly being watched. She suffers from social anxiety because of
these offences. She took time off work due to stress and physical exhaustion.
She is afraid to walk alone.
iii.
D.B.:
D.B.
suffers from anxiety because of these offences. She does not feel safe. She has
lost trust in people close to her. Her ability to sleep has suffered from the
emotional distress that she has experienced. She, too, avoids using public
washrooms for fear that someone may be watching her. She describes lasting
emotional damage.
iv.
N.P.:
N.P.
communicated that this incident has deeply affected her and changed how she
lives and feels every day. She feels alone and afraid. She no longer feels
comfortable in private spaces, like washrooms. She feels like she is constantly
being watched. She describes the incident as having taken away her sense of
safety, privacy, and control. She continues to struggle to feel normal and to
find peace of mind. N.P. also missed work from the struggles resulting from her
victimization.
29
.
It is clear from these statements that Mr. Sajeevan’s
offending has had a
‘chilling effect’ on his victims, causing them to modify their behaviour
due to fear of the consequences that may befall them should their behaviour be covertly
observed by someone like him. The emotional and psychological harm caused is
palpable. I find that Mr.
Sajeevan’s offending has had a significant and enduring impact on
his victims.
V.        THE APPLICABLE LAW
i.
Voyeurism at the Supreme Court of Canada
30
.
In
R. v. Jarvis
,
2019 SCC 10
, the Supreme
Court of Canada found that Parliament’s intent in enacting the voyeurism
offence was to protect individuals’ privacy and sexual integrity, particularly
from new threats posed by the abuse of evolving technologies: at para. 48.
31
.
The Court noted that “recordings made using a
camera hidden inside a washroom will breach reasonable expectations of privacy
regardless of the purpose for which they are made, the age of the person
recorded, or the relationship of the person recorded and the person who did the
recording”: at para. 30.
32
.
A few years later, in
R. v. Downes
,
2023
SCC 6
, the Court confirmed that “[m]ost sex crimes, including voyeurism, are
committed by men, while the victims are usually women and children”: at para.
27. Voyeurism is therefore a profoundly gender-based sex crime.
33
.
The Court further observed that “[v]oyeurism is
thus
both
a sexual and a privacy-based offence.
Section 162(1)
is
intended to deal with both these related harms: behaviour that violates sexual
integrity, and behaviour that breaches privacy”: at para. 28 (italics in
original).
34
.
In speaking to the essence of the
delict
,
the Court observed:
Surreptitious observation or recording of a
person where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and which occurs in
a ‘safe place’ under
s. 162(1)
, violates or poses a risk of violating sexual
integrity, even if nudity is not reasonably expected at the specific time of
the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a
quintessentially private and ‘safe place’ violates trust and can result in the
person’s humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of
self-esteem. It can also cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the
person is not observed or recorded when nude: at para. 47.
35
.
The Court further endorsed the concern that
where these violations of trust result in the creation of digital recordings,
they “can be easily replicated, cropped and manipulated in ways and for uses
that disregard [the victim’s] right to control their own bodies […] while also
exposing them to the shame and humiliation that often results from
instantaneous and widespread dissemination”: at para. 47.
ii.         Purpose and Principles of Sentencing
36
.
The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to
protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by
imposing just sanctions with the following legitimate objectives of sentencing:
denunciation; deterrence; rehabilitation; the protection of society; and
promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the
harm done to victims or the community: s. 718.
37
.
The relative weighting of these principles
depends upon the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the individual offender.
Ultimately, “the overarching duty of a sentencing judge is to draw upon all the
legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a ‘just and appropriate’
sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender”:
R. v. C.A.M.
,
1996 CanLII 230 (SCC)
, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at
para.
82
.
iii.        The Fundamental Principle of Sentencing
38
.
The fundamental principle of sentencing is set
out in s. 718.1: “A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”
39
.
A fit and appropriate sentence is one that is
proportionate; said another way, proportionality is the organizing principle in
achieving a fit, fair and principled sanction:
R. v. Parranto
,
2021 SCC
46
, at para.
10
;
R. v. Morris
,
2021 ONCA 680
, at para.
59
.
40
.
As the Court of Appeal for Ontario has recently reaffirmed
in
R. v. Gilmore
,
2025 ONCA 517
, at para.
33
:
The proportionality principle is rooted in retributive
or dessert-based theories of punishment that define a just sanction as one that
is deserved by an offender, based solely on the seriousness of the offence and
an offender’s moral blameworthiness. In Canada, proportionality operates as a
restraint or limitation on punishment.
41
.
The principle requires that “[t]he more serious
the crime and its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of
responsibility, the heavier the sentence will be”:
R. v. Lacasse
,
2015
SCC 64
,
at para.
12
;
Morris
,
supra
, at para.
66
.
42
.
The proportionality analysis includes recognition
of the harm caused to victims by the offender’s crime:
R. v. Nur
,
2015
SCC 15
, at para.
43
;
Morris
,
supra
, at para.
64
.
iv
.
Other Relevant Sentencing
Principles
43
.
Section 718.2 lists additional principles that courts
must consider in arriving at a just and appropriate sentence. I have
specifically considered the following:
a.
the mitigating and aggravating circumstances
relating to the offence or the offender, s. 718.2(a).
b.
the parity principle, s. 718.2(b): see
R. v.
Pearce
,
2021 ONCA 239
at para.
17
, where it has been said that this
principle “preserves fairness in sentencing by promoting the equal treatment of
offenders according to law. It applies as between […] the offender and others
who have committed similar crimes, where those others are similar to the
offender in terms of degree of responsibility.”
c.
the principle of totality, s. 718.2(c): where
consecutive sentences are imposed for multiple offences, the sentencing court
must ensure that the cumulative sentence does not exceed the overall
culpability of the offender:
C.A.M.
,
supra
, at para.
42
.
d.
the effect of a guilty plea as a sign of remorse:
R. v. Johnston and Tremayne
,
1970 CanLII 281 (ON CA)
, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 64 (Ont. C.A.);
R. v.
Griffiths
,
2025 ONCA 511
, at para.
16
.
e.
the exercise of restraint, s. 718.2(d) and (e):
where the imposition of a term of imprisonment should be the penal sanction of
last resort.
f.
where a term of incarceration must be imposed on
a youthful first offender, the term should be as short as possible and tailored
to the individual circumstances of the accused: see
R. v. Priest
(1996),
1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA)
, 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at p. 545.
v.
Recent Voyeurism Sentencing Case Law in
Ontario
44
.
The Crown did not initially provide the court
with any case law in support of its position. After my request for further
submissions, the Crown provided the court with two cases:
R. v. Medard
,
2023 ONCJ 578
, and
R. v. B.H.
,
2017 ONCJ 377
. In both cases, the
defendants pleaded guilty to voyeurism. In both cases, the courts sentenced the
first-time offenders to conditional sentence orders. However, in both cases there
are meaningful distinguishing factors present which are not extant in this
case.
45
.
R. v. B.H.
was a
pre-
Jarvis
case from 2017. He was a vice-principal at an elementary
school who had installed hidden cameras in the staff washroom, which he used to
record male staff members of the school. None of the recordings were ever
disseminated. The first-time offender pleaded guilty to nine counts of
voyeurism. He was sentenced to a CSO for 16 months. Features that distinguish
B.H.
from the present case include the following: the offender lost his family; he
lost his career; there was child abuse and a mental health explanation that
informed his offending; he had been engaged in intensive therapy with a
specialist and had a sex offender treatment assessment, with his future risk
assessed as low.
46
.
In
R. v. Medard
, the offender was a
hospital security officer. A student nurse was using the staff washroom at the
hospital and while she was sitting on the toilet she observed a cell phone
underneath the sink. It was propped up by a Styrofoam cup. She picked up the
phone and observed a video of herself using the toilet, her genitalia exposed.
She deleted the video and advised other hospital staff. The phone belonged to,
and was set up in the washroom by, Mr. Medard. He pleaded guilty to one count
of voyeurism and was sentenced to a 12-month CSO. Prior to this incident, the
offender had completed a Police Foundations course, with the conviction ending
that career aspiration. A psychological risk assessment was completed, in which
the offender was determined to be a low risk of recidivating. Further
distinguishing that case from this one: Mr. Medard’s case included a plea to a
single count of voyeurism, for a single offence, that occurred on one single
day, in relation to one victim only; the single victim did not provide a victim
impact statement; Mr. Medard enjoyed broad support through character letters,
and had completed various certificates, programs, and volunteerism. None of
these factors is present in the instant case.
47
.
Counsel for Mr. Sajeevan provided the court with
a single case in support of his position:
R. v. P.R.
,
2022 ONCJ 491
. In
that case, the offender was the father of his victim-son. On a single occasion,
ten years earlier, the offender had made a surreptitious video recording of his
son – who was then 9 or 10 years old – in his bedroom. But for a portion of the
video when the victim is shirtless, he is otherwise robed, and his genitalia
are not exposed. P.R. had no criminal record. He was sentenced to a 60-day
conditional sentence order.
48
.
To situate Mr. Sajeevan’s case within the
broader jurisprudential landscape in this province, I conducted my own canvass
of recent voyeurism sentencing case law.
49
.
In
R. v. Jarvis
,
2019 ONSC 4938
, the
offender was a schoolteacher who recorded two dozen students and one teacher.
All victims were fully clothed, and while at school. The offender was a first
offender who underwent counselling sessions, and a sex offender treatment
report was prepared. He was sentenced to six months jail and 12 months
probation. The court was not persuaded that the principles of denunciation and
deterrence could be satisfied with a conditional sentence. These proceedings
occurred after an original acquittal and appeals to the Ontario Court of Appeal
and the Supreme Court of Canada.
50
.
In
R. v. R.R.
,
2022 ONCJ 407
, the
27-year-old offender was found guilty after trial of sexual assault and
voyeurism. Following the sexual assault, the offender took a photo of his
victim’s naked breasts. He had no criminal record. The sentence was six months
jail on the voyeurism count.
51
.
In
R. v. Wong
,
2022 ONCJ 546
, the
52-year-old offender pleaded guilty to three counts of voyeurism. He was a
photographer who, across two decades, had compiled some 9,000 voyeuristic files
of his victims on various of his electronic devices. The offender completed
psychotherapy and counselling sessions before sentencing. He was assessed as not
presenting any future risk of recidivism. He had no criminal record. He was
sentenced to 21 months jail, followed by 18 months probation.
52
.
In
R. v. Rhodes
,
2022 ONCA 705
, the Court
of Appeal dismissed the offender’s sentence appeal, where the trial judge
sentenced him to a carceral term of 18 months (concurrent) for three counts of
voyeurism, prowl by night, and indecent act. Two cell phones seized by police
revealed multiple recordings of female victims in various states of undress,
inside their homes, over a period of 2.5 years.
53
.
In
R. v. Seangio
,
[2023] O.J. No. 5869
(Ct. Jus.)
, the court found the 37-year-old offender guilty of 31 counts of
voyeurism following a trial. The offender had immigrated to Canada, became a
police officer, and had a supportive family. He had no criminal record. The
offender was sentenced to 24 months jail.
54
.
In
R. v. Dowran
,
2024 ONCJ 341
, the
40-year-old offender pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism, consisting of
two discrete events, where he had video recorded up a young girl’s skirt at a
mall, and another where he video recorded a woman in the nude at an Airbnb he
owned. Dozens of other voyeuristic videos were located on his cellphone. A risk
assessment was completed, and he was found to have a low-density range of
criminogenic needs. The offender was sentenced to four months jail, followed by
two years probation.
55
.
In
R. v. Riggs
,
2024 ONSC 2862
, the
60-year-old offender pleaded guilty to four counts of voyeurism for offences
spanning six years. He had made numerous visual recordings of his female
neighbour in various states of undress, including of her having sexual
intercourse with her boyfriend. He had no criminal record. The offender was
sentenced to 16 months, followed by three years probation.
56
.
In
R. v. Samal
,
[2025] O.J. No. 83 (Ct.
Jus.)
, the 43-year-old offender pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism. He
had an Airbnb rental in which he employed a spy-cam that doubled as a phone
charger to video record guests in his rental, including one couple having
sexual intercourse and another in the nude. The offences spanned three months.
He was an immigrant from India. He had a strong employment history. A risk
assessment was completed, and the offender was determined to be at an average
risk to reoffend. He had no criminal record. The court sentenced him to six
months jail and two years probation.
57
.
Finally, in
R. v. T.O.
,
2025 ONCJ 42
, the
44-year-old offender pleaded guilty to four counts of voyeurism and one count
of theft. Using his cellphone, he had surreptitiously recorded children and
adults, focusing on areas such as the buttocks, breasts, genitalia, and some
persons in the nude. The offences spanned five years. There were more than
1,000 voyeuristic images in total.  Both a PSR and psychotherapy report were
completed. The offender was found to be in the low-moderate range for
recidivism. He had no criminal record. The court rejected the appropriateness
of a conditional sentence order, observing that the more significantly
denunciatory effect of a carceral jail sentence was needed to convey the
serious gravity of the offence, and to deter other potential offenders. The
offender was sentenced to 18 months jail.
vi.        The Availability of Conditional Sentence Orders
58
.
Both the Crown and Mr. Sajeevan submit that a term
of imprisonment, by way of a conditional sentence order (“CSO”), would be an
appropriate disposition in this case. Section 742.1 provides:
If a person is convicted of an offence and
the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, the court
may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community,
order that the offender serve the sentence in the community […] if
(a)
the court is satisfied that the service of
the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community
and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of
sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2;
(b)
the offence is not an offence punishable by
a minimum term of imprisonment;
(c)
and (d) omitted as irrelevant to this
proceeding.
59
.
I find that a term of imprisonment in the
reformatory range is appropriate in this case. I also accept that the offence
of voyeurism is not an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment. The
crimes to which Mr. Sajeevan has pleaded guilty would make a CSO an available
sentence in this case.
60
.
This leaves open the question of whether the
court can be satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered
by the offender serving his sentence in the community, and that such a sentence
would be consistent with the purpose and principles set out in sections 718 to
718.2. Satisfaction of s. 742.1(a) is a condition precedent to the imposition
of a conditional sentence.
61
.
To assess the potential danger to the community
posed by the offender, if they were to serve their sentence in the community,
two factors must be considered: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and
(2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. As
the Supreme Court has stated: “If the judge finds that there is a real risk of
re-offence, incarceration should be imposed”:
R. v. Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5
, at
para.
69
.
62
.
If the judge finds an offender might pose some
risk of endangering the safety of the community, “it is
possible
that
this risk be reduced to a minimal one by the imposition of appropriate
conditions to the sentence”:
ibid
., at para. 72 (underlining added for
emphasis).
63
.
Other than the
form
of custody proposed, this
proceeding did not start out as one where the Crown and the defence had agreed
to make a joint submission on sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. This was
not, initially, a case where the principles articulated in
Anthony-Cook
applied,
though I accept that over a two-month period between my taking the pleas and
the delivery of the PSR, those circumstances have changed.
vii.       Joint Positions on Sentence and
Anthony-Cook
64
.
The Crown submitted in its written argument that
a CSO is an appropriate disposition in this case, and that the now-joint
position should be acceded to for the following reasons:
i.
The lack of a criminal record;
ii.
That Mr. Sajeevan’s conduct was “opportunistic”,
and that “there is no indication he created the sight path that allowed him to
observe his female roommates”;
iii.
He was cooperative with the investigation by his
roommates, and then the police;
iv.
He pleaded guilty. The Crown notes that this
factor “has significant weight given the current climate of trial stacking. Trial
stacking results in pleas on the date of trial that garner sentences that are
at the low end of the range or in trials not being reached or in trials
ultimately being stayed for 11(b)”.
v.
The potential for immigration consequences;
vi.
That Mr. Sajeevan has been bail-compliant;
vii.
A generally positive PSR.
65
.
The Crown further submitted the following:
i.
A CSO is a jail sentence with greater
denunciatory and deterrent effect than simple probation;
ii.
A CSO segregates the offender from the public
through house arrest “and therefore protects society”;
iii.
A CSO offers greater rehabilitative
opportunities than simple probation;
iv.
A CSO “promotes reparations for harm done to the
victims and promotes a sense of responsibility in the offender”.
66
.
The Supreme Court of Canada in
Anthony-Cook
has acknowledged that joint submissions on sentence after a guilty plea are “vital
to the operation of the criminal justice system”: at paras. 1-2.
67
.
The Court stated that “[
g]uilty pleas in
exchange for joint submissions on sentence
are a ‘proper and necessary part
of the administration of criminal justice’” and that when properly conducted,
“they benefit not only the accused, but also victims, witnesses, counsel, and
the administration of justice generally”: at para. 35 (emphasis added).
68
.
The Court cautioned that a joint submission
should not be rejected lightly: “Rejection denotes a submission so unhinged
from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance
would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant
circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution
discussions, to believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had
broken down”, at para. 34.
69
.
The Court of Appeal for Ontario has confirmed
that even in cases where the joint submission is “lenient, perhaps even very
lenient, this is not a permissible basis for rejecting it”:
R. v. Harasiuk
,
2023 ONCA 594
, at para.
25
.
70
.
Rejecting a joint submission on sentence should
be done only in rare cases:
Anthony-Cook
,
supra
, at para.
54
;
R.
v. Fuller
,
2020 ONCA 115
, at para.
16
.
71
.
The rarity with which joint submissions should
not
be endorsed by the court are due “to a large extent because of the
quid pro
quo
provided by accused persons in giving up their right to a trial and
pleading guilty
in exchange for a joint submission.
In exchange for their
plea of guilty, accused persons require a high degree of certainty that the
joint submission agreed upon will be respected”:
R. v. Wesley
,
2025 ONCA
51
, at para.
72
(emphasis added).
72
.
With that said, joint submissions on sentence
are not sacrosanct, and trial judges may depart from them:
Anthony-Cook
,
supra
, at para.
3
. Indeed, the plea inquiry within section 606(1.1)(b)(iii)
of the
Criminal Code
is explicit that “the court is not bound by any
agreement made between the accused and the prosecutor”.
73
.
A judge’s role includes maintaining public
confidence in the institution of the courts, and sentencing judges should avoid
rendering a decision that diminishes that confidence in the eyes of an informed
and reasonable public:
Anthony-Cook
,
supra
, at para.
33
.
74
.
I accept that in seeking to maintain the
public’s confidence in the administration of criminal justice, my judicial
discretion is tempered when dealing with joint submissions on sentence, and
that departures from them should be exceptional and well-justified.
VI.       THE SENTENCE
i.          The Offences before this Court
75
.
Mr. Sajeevan has been found guilty of
surreptitiously observing and visually recording four female victims who were
each in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy – the
bathroom of their own home, a widely-accepted ‘safe place’. These crimes were
perpetrated against them by someone they trusted, one of their housemates. These
crimes occurred repeatedly over a period of some six months.
76
.
The crime of voyeurism is a sinister one. It is a
crime where the offender violates the personal integrity, safety, security, and
privacy of their victim, without the victim knowing that they are being watched,
in what are otherwise expected to be ‘safe places’.
77
.
The chilling effects of voyeuristic surveillance
are predictable. As the victim impact statements before this court plainly
show, the impacts of these crimes may result in the modification of the
victim’s behaviour due to their fear of unknown consequences of being secretly
watched or recorded. This, in turn, results in a form of self-censorship, which
itself intrudes upon the victim’s sphere of personal autonomy, striking at the
core of what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence in a liberal
democracy.
78
.
When the voyeuristic act is video recorded, as
it was here, the offender may purpose and repurpose the spoils of their
violative act, often without the victim’s knowledge, to whatever ends they
choose.
79
.
That potential for storing, duplicating, repurposing,
or otherwise sharing such voyeuristic recordings presents the prospect of future
and repeated violations of the victim’s personal integrity, safety, security
and their right to a reasonable expectation of privacy.
80
.
Although the victims in this case believe that
they deleted the voyeuristic recordings from Mr. Sajeevan’s electronic devices,
it is unknown whether the offending digital files had been stored or duplicated
elsewhere, shared with anyone, posted to the Internet, or otherwise repurposed
by Mr. Sajeevan in any other manner. To be clear, there is no evidence of such
mischiefs having occurred, and I make no finding in that regard, but I do raise
its possibility as a risk of potential future harm. At the very least, I can
and do find that he recorded his crimes so that he could watch them as and when
he wished to.
ii.         Mitigating and
Aggravating Considerations
81
.
I find the following aspects of this case
mitigating:
i.
Mr. Sajeevan comes before this court as a
youthful, 20-year-old, first-time offender. He has no prior criminal record and,
but for these crimes, otherwise appears to be of good character.
ii.
He pleaded guilty to these offences. In doing
so, he has spared the Crown the burden of proving this case to the
constitutional requirement, and he has saved court time and resources in doing
so.
iii.
I find that Mr. Sajeevan is sincerely remorseful
for his crimes and is genuine in that he wishes to take responsibility for
them.
82
.
While collateral consequences, including
immigration consequences, are not mitigating
per se
, Canadian criminal
law recognizes that they may nevertheless speak to the personal circumstances
of the offender. The question is “whether the effect of those consequences
means that a particular sentence would have a more significant impact on the
offender because of his or her circumstances”:
R. v. Suter
,
2018 SCC 34
,
at para.
48
;
R. v. Pham
,
2013 SCC 15
, at para.
11
.
83
.
Consideration of collateral consequences is
mandatory, not optional:
R. v. D.B
.,
2025 ONCA 577
, at para.
13
.
84
.
The weight to be assigned to collateral
consequences, however, varies from case to case and should be determined having
regard to the type and seriousness of the offence. This consideration is an
exercise in discretion by the sentencing judge, and the question is always
whether the sentence that is ultimately imposed is proportionate to the gravity
of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender:
Pham
,
at paras.
12 and 14
.
85
.
Trial courts have also been cautioned not to
impose “inadequate or artificial sentences at all, let alone for the purpose of
circumventing Parliament’s will on matters of immigration”:
R. v. Badhwar
,
2011 ONCA 266
, at para.
45
.
86
.
I accept, and have considered, that there may be
serious collateral immigration consequences for Mr. Sajeevan because of his criminal
conduct.
87
.
By way of aggravating factors, I consider the
following:
i.
This was not a one-time moral failing on Mr.
Sajeevan’s part; rather, these crimes were committed multiple times, over a period
of approximately six months.
ii.
Multiple females were victimized by Mr. Sajeevan
– four in total.
iii.
Mr. Sajeevan surreptitiously observed – and video
recorded – his female housemates while they were using the washroom in what
should have been the safety and comfort of their home, a place that attracts an
extremely high degree of privacy.
iv.
The victims were, justifiably, significantly impacted
by Mr. Sajeevan’s repeated violations of their sexual integrity and privacy
rights: s. 718.2(a)(iii.1).
v.
Mr. Sajeevan’s offending against his female housemates
was a breach of trust.
vi.
These crimes were video recorded on at least two
different electronic devices, and Mr. Sajeevan kept these videos, which
revictimizes and allows for repeated compromise of the privacy of the victims
(by watching and re-watching them), including the potential to distribute them.
88
.
In all of these circumstances, I find Mr.
Sajeevan’s offending to be grave, and his individual moral culpability to be very
high. This was more than curiosity; it was sustained predation.
89
.
In my view, the paramount sentencing principles here
are denunciation, deterrence, and the protection of society. In Mr. Sajeevan’s
case, both general and specific deterrence are required. Given his lack of
criminal record and his relative youth, I also recognize that rehabilitation
remains an important factor.
90
.
The parity principle requires that the sentence I
impose on Mr. Sajeevan should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders committed in similar circumstances: s. 718.2(b).
91
.
The totality principle requires that, where
consecutive sentences are imposed, the overall sentence should not be unduly
long or harsh: s. 718.2(c).
92
.
While I agree with counsel that a term of
imprisonment is appropriate in this case, I do not find that a conditional
sentence order achieves the appropriate balance among the competing sentencing principles
that I must weigh. This was
not
a case in which there was a
quid pro
quo
with Mr. Sajeevan giving up his right to a trial in exchange for the high
degree of certainty that a joint submission on sentence would have presented.
Defence counsel only joined the Crown in its submission on sentence two months
after the pleas were taken, long after it had become clear that the court was
considering ‘real jail’.
iii.              The
Anthony-Cook Issue
93
.
Returning to the issue of joint submissions on
sentence on a guilty plea, in the unique circumstances of this case, I am of
the view that a
departure from the position of counsel is
warranted
for the following reasons.
94
.
First, contrary to the Crown’s submission that
Mr. Sajeevan’s guilty plea should be given significant weight “given the
current climate of trial stacking”, this case came before me in a plea court,
not in a stacked trial court. In fact, no trial date had ever been set in this
matter. This was not a case where the Crown offered a low plea position because
this case was competing for trial time on a stacked list. Nor was it in 11(b)
jeopardy — Mr. Sajeevan pleaded guilty within some four months of the
Information having been laid. And there are no apparent evidentiary problems in
the Crown’s case, certainly none that I was told of.
95
.
Next, this case did not originally come before
me as a joint submission where there was a “
quid pro quo
provided by
[Mr. Sajeevan] in giving up [his] right to a trial and pleading guilty in
exchange for a joint submission.” Instead, this proceeding commenced as an
informed and voluntary guilty plea with open submissions – it only became a
joint submission two months after the pleas were taken. The original intent of
the litigants was not one that can be described as having carried with it
any
degree of certainty, since the parties were eight months apart in terms of
their submissions as to the length of sentence. The original terms of this
resolution did not contemplate a joint submission at all:
R. v. Omoragbon
,
2025 ONCA 481
, at para.
2
;
Nahanee
,
supra
, at paras.
27, 30-41
.
96
.
Third, the Crown’s submission that segregation
of Mr. Sajeevan from the public through home confinement will protect society
glosses over the fact that these offences were committed inside of his home, in
the most private of places within his home (the bathroom), against the very
people with whom he was residing. To suggest that home confinement is a fit and
appropriate sentence is not just a tenuous proposition but, in my view, is one
that is markedly detached from the realities of these offences and this
offender. It stretches the bounds of credulity to imagine an optional condition
to a CSO that is reasonably capable of preventing the commission of further
offences of this sort, not to mention the logistical obstacles of actually
enforcing them.
97
.
Finally, the facts accepted by this court are
that Mr. Sajeevan committed these offences on multiple occasions, against
multiple female roommates, video recording his crimes on multiple devices, over
the course of half-a-year. There is nothing in the record to console the court
that he is at a low risk to reoffend. Rather, the PSR assesses Mr. Sajeevan as
lacking insight into the seriousness of his offending behaviour and the
resulting consequences for his victims, an appraisal with which I agree and
adopt.
98
.
In conjunction with his lack of insight, and in
the absence of any evidence suggesting that he is at a low risk to reoffend, I
find that the risk of Mr. Sajeevan reoffending is extant, and the gravity of
any future recidivism can be effortlessly gleaned from the four victim impact
statements filed in this case.
99
.
Ultimately, I find that the now-joint submission
of a 12-month conditional sentence order, in the circumstances of this case,
for this offender, is inconsistent with the fundamental principle of
proportionality. The proposed sentence does not sufficiently meet the
principles of denunciation and deterrence (either specific or general). It is
inconsistent with the recent jurisprudential authorities determining that
nothing short of ‘real jail’ will meet the objectives of sentencing for like
offenders, thereby offending the principle of parity. The now-joint position
proposed, in my view, is something other than “very lenient”; rather, it is disproportionate
to the gravity of these offences and the moral responsibility of this offender.
100
.
In short, a conditional sentence order is so
removed from the circumstances of these offences and this offender as to make
its acceptance contrary to the public interest, having the potential to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute. I find that ordering a CSO on
these facts would cause an informed and reasonable member of the public to lose
confidence in the institution of the courts.
101
.
I am not satisfied that a term of imprisonment
in the community would
not
endanger the safety of the community,
including other potential unsuspecting victims. I cannot be satisfied that the
precondition for imposing a CSO has been met: s. 742.1(a).
102
.
I find that, on the facts of this case, only a
truly custodial jail sentence can meet the requirements of sections 718-718.2. Consecutive
jail sentences are warranted.
iv.              Disposition
103
.
I find that the fit and appropriate range of
sentence for this offender on the facts of this case for the four offences
pleaded to would be between six- and 12-months custody.
104
.
Considering the uniqueness of how this case
proceeded, however, I sentence Mr. Sajeevan as follows:
i.
42 days jail on each of the four counts, all
jail sentences to be served consecutively, one after the other, for a total
jail sentence of 168 days, or approximately five and one-half months.
ii.
Following Mr. Sajeevan’s release from custody,
he will be bound by a Probation Order for a duration of 18 months, with the
following terms attaching, in addition to the statutory conditions:
i.
Report to a Probation Officer within three (3)
business days of your release from custody, and report thereafter as directed;
ii.
Reside as directed by your Probation Officer;
iii.
Take any counselling as directed by your
Probation Officer, including, but not limited to, sexual boundaries;
iv.
Sign any releases that will permit your
Probation Officer to monitor your enrolment in, attendance at, and progress in
any such counselling;
v.
Do not have contact or communication, directly
or indirectly, through any physical, electronic or other means, with S.S.,
A.S., D.B., or N.P.;
vi.
Do not attend within 100m of any place you know
S.S., A.S., D.B., or N.P. to live, work, study, worship, frequent, or otherwise
know them to be.
105
.
I also direct that, pursuant to s. 743.21, Mr.
Sajeevan is hereby prohibited from communicating, directly or indirectly, with S.S.,
A.S., D.B., or N.P., during the custodial period of this sentence.
106
.
The Crown has requested a DNA order in this
case. The offence of voyeurism is a secondary designated offence pursuant to s.
487.04(a). For an order under s. 487.051 to apply, the offence must be
prosecuted by indictment. The Crown has proceeded summarily in this case. I
have no jurisdiction to make a DNA order.
107
.
The Crown has also requested that an order be
made under the
Sex Offender Information Registration Act,
S.C. 2004, c.
10 (“
SOIRA
”). The offence of voyeurism is a secondary designated offence,
pursuant to s. 490.011(1)(a)(i). A court only has jurisdiction to make this
order “if the prosecutor applies for the order and establishes beyond a
reasonable doubt that the person committed the secondary offence with intent to
commit a primary offence”: s. 490.012(15). The facts of this case do not
support a finding that Mr. Sajeevan committed these offences with intent to

Released: 2 October 2025.
