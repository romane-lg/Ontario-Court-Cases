overview
after trial, mr. wright was found
guilty of four drug-trafficking related counts and multiple firearm-related
offences. on april 7, 2022, he was in physical possession of a loaded handgun
and over $3000 cash. he was found in constructive possession of illicit items
inside a condo unit, including over $20 000 cash, fentanyl mixed with a
benzodiazepine and heroin mixed with fentanyl.
a joint submission of six years
custody, globally for all offences, was put before the court. it is within an appropriate
range of sentence and i will impose it.
sentencing was adjourned to permit
further consideration of an impact of race and culture assessment report [
hereinafter
“irca”
] received during sentencing submissions. this
irca
report
delved into factors that brought mr. wright into conflict with the criminal
justice system. it deserved careful attention, and sentencing was adjourned to
permit that.
circumstances
of
mr.
wright
mr. wright is 27 years old. he has
been in presentence custody, on this matter and another, since 2022. he was 24
years old when he committed the offences before this court.
he is a black male of jamaican
descent raised in a single-parent home. mr. wright’s
mother
was
a
teenager
when she
gave birth
to
him
and
his
brother.
his parents separated when he was two.
his father established a new
family life, with a new partner and children. they raised those children in a
stable neighbourhood, away from negative influences. as a result, mr. wright’s
half-siblings ended up with opportunities that he and his brother did not:
they
went
to
college
and
got
employment
offers
with
their
father’s
trucking
company.
in
contrast,
mr.
wright’s
mother
was
the
sole
financial
provider
for
her
two
sons
for
many years. they had to live where she could afford. from age three to sixteen,
they lived at a notoriously dangerous apartment building at jane and finch. the
report described his childhood memories of that home:
…a low-income neighbourhood,
notorious for crime, poverty, and drug-related activities. he explained that in
this neighbourhood
where
he
grew
up,
trouble
was
literally
outside their door. for instance, the
local park was burned down by individuals;
there
were
frequent
shootings
in
the
hallways,
and the elevator was often unusable due to urine and excessive garbage.
mr. wright added that the staircases were littered with needles
and drug
paraphernalia
like needles and
pieces of tin foil, and he witnessed
ongoing drug transactions and people who had overdosed.
he remembered his mother warning
him to watch out for needles while walking. he also recalled regularly seeing
ambulances in the area responding to drug-related emergencies. from his
perspective, gun violence was also prevalent. he highlighted that, because of
the dangers, his mother did not allow him and his brother to play or socialize
outside.
…
there
was
a
heavy
police
presence
in
the
area,
with
10
to 15 officers patrolling the building
approximately twice a week. the officers would start at the 21st floor, the top
level of the building,
and
work
their
way
down.
mr.
wright
recalled
seeing the officers put the elevator into service and clear each hallway
and staircase. groups of five officers would monitor the staircases while
others used the elevator to methodically check the floors to ensure there was
no one loitering. he stated that he frequently encountered the police while
using the
stairs
to
leave
his
home
and
was
often
subjected
to
searches.
he added that he was regularly carded, strip- searched, and questioned about
where
he lived, why he was in that
residence, and where he was going. mr. wright noted that these interactions
became a normal experience for him and his friends during that time.
his mother could not afford much
beyond necessaries for survival. growing up, mr. wright missed out on
opportunities because of that. he could not join a basketball program
he
really
wanted
to
participate
in
with
his
friends.
he
missed
school
trips,
school dances, and
other social events for the same reason.
one such
missed
opportunity
happened in
grade 7. mr.
wright
could not
afford
to go on a school camping trip. his close
friend drowned on that trip. mr. wright, a strong swimmer, still shoulders
guilt for not being there to save his friend.
mr. wright began to act out after
his friend drowned. he experimented with marijuana
and
started
skipping
school.
this
rebellious
behaviour
led
him
to
be
transferred
to a different school. the
irca
report’s author observed that:
…bereaved young adults frequently
experience intense and prolonged
grief,
as
well
as
declines
in
physical
health,
greater reliance
on
healthcare
for
emotional
and
physical
issues,
and increased substance use as a coping mechanism.
mr. wright was still in middle
school when his friend passed away. there were other
challenges hitting him
at
the same time. after
being
academically
successful
in
his french immersion elementary school, he
found the change to english lessons disconcerting. his behavioural problems got
worse.
he was transferred to a different
school. this school, mr. wright described, was “one of the worst schools in the
finch area….many individuals who attended [
school
] either
ended
up
deceased
or
incarcerated.”
unsurprisingly,
his
behaviour
did
not
improve.
despite
being
quite
intelligent,
mr.
wright
did
not
finish
high
school
as
a
teenager. by this point, he was regularly
colliding with the criminal justice system in ways he said he did nothing to
prompt. he recalled being strip searched at school by his principal, in the
presence of police officers. he was expelled from high school, despite having
good grades, due to a minor breach of a behavioural contract.
he started at an alternative high
school. they expelled him when he incurred criminal
charges.
mr.
wright
described this
as
“the
beginning
of
a
downward
spiral
in
his life”. he began using percocets and
cough syrup to get through the day. he was constantly being arrested, mostly
for offences that he was later acquitted of.
he also continued to suffer loss.
he lost several friends to gun violence. some of these
deaths
happened
because
his
friend
was
in
the
wrong
neighbourhood
at
the
wrong time. about seven years ago, mr.
wright himself was grazed by a bullet. this left him in constant fear for his
own life.
at some point, mr. wright leaned
into the stereotype he had resisted so strongly as
a
youth.
he
became
involved
in
the
drug
trade
and
possessed
a
loaded
handgun.
the
irca
report shed little specific insight into how and why
that happened. it is possible he armed
himself
because
he
struggles
with
ptsd.
it
is
possible
he
armed
himself
because he
narrowly
escaped
being
shot
at.
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
the
firearm
he
carried
was to protect his drug trafficking
business. all these scenarios could, and probably were, simultaneously true.
the
report
did
suggest
that
his
impoverished
upbringing
led
to
a
desire
to
possess quality clothes,
jewelry, shoes. indirectly, i took this to explain why he was trafficking
fentanyl and oxy. this means mr. wright was trafficking drugs out of pure
greed, sympathetic background or not.
but mr. wright was also spending about $150 per day on
percocets and cough syrup.
indeed,
in
the
unit
he
was
staying,
police
located
about
20
empty
bottles
of
illegally
obtained hydrocodone (an opioid) cough syrup. he admitted needing to use the
cough syrup to function throughout the day.
in other words, mr. wright’s motives for trafficking
drugs were multi-faceted and included greed and feeding a significant drug
habit. he has since quit using addictive controlled substances and is committed
to remaining free of them once released from
custody.
in
march
2023,
mr.
wright
received
his
high
school
diploma.
his
progress
towards this goal was nothing short of impressive:
mr. wright shared that he
recently completed high school in march 2023 while incarcerated. remarkably, he
set a record by enrolling in february 2023 and finishing all the requirements
for high school in just one month. he reflected that completing high school had
always been a significant milestone
for
his
mother,
and achieving
it
was
a
way
to
make
her proud while demonstrating his commitment to rehabilitation. mr. wright
noted that opportunities for rehabilitation at the detention centre were
limited, with few programs available to showcase personal growth. pursuing his
education
was
one
of
his
few
constructive
options,
and
he embraced it fully.
additionally,
he
mentioned
that
the
prison
offers
17
programs,
and he has completed 16 of them. mr. wright shared that he remains committed to
self-improvement in every way possible, focusing on his mental health, physical
well-being, and education. he stated that he is currently enrolled in a
business administration course through centennial college, offered via distance
learning in collaboration with the prison. he views this course as essential
for his entrepreneurial ambitions, as it would enhance his credibility with
potential investors
and
business
partners.
mr.
wright
highlighted
that
he
has
completed
two
mandatory
courses
and
is
about
to
start his
third,
with
plans
to
graduate
and
attend
the
ceremony
with his parents.
some of the grades he earned, from inside custody: 87%
in grade 12 level literacy; 88% in grade 11 entrepreneurship; 80% in grade 11
mathematics. currently, mr. wright is enrolled in centennial college’s business
management program. he is studying marketing and has five courses to complete
towards a certificate in marketing.
amadeusz, an
educational
group
working
at
the
toronto
south
detention
centre, helped him work at these
educational goals. they said:
throughout his involvement with
amadeusz, dominic has demonstrated that he is a dedicated, capable, and engaged
participant. he attends programs regularly, completes assignments,
takes
initiative
in
his
learning,
and
asks
for
help
when needed. additionally, dominic maintains a positive attitude toward his
work with amadeusz staff.
mr. wright has targeted plans and
goals for when he is released. he wants to further his education and his
knowledge of business management in particular. for someone who seemed to
navigate much of his teenaged years alone, he now has a network
of
community
supports.
his
brother
is
clearly
a
strong
source
of
support.
a
friend has
offered
him
a
job
in
his
auto
body
shop.
his
father,
with
whom
mr.
wright
has
re-built
a relationship, has also offered employment upon release.
circumstances
of
the
offences
and
sentencing
objectives
these crimes were all committed in
the early morning hours of april 7, 2022. mr. wright
was
returning
to
a
condo
unit
at
6
am
when
police
took
him
down.
that
take-down was on video.
the police were professional and mr. wright was co-operative. during a pat-down
search, the arresting officers located a loaded fn 5-7 handgun inside mr.
wright’s
vest.
his
pouch
contained
over
$3000
cash,
47
oxycodone
pills,
and
5.41
grams
of mdma.
the condo unit was then searched,
pursuant to warrant, and the following illicit items were found inside: loose
bullets, a loaded overcapacity magazine, $20,700 cash, and
2.93
grams
of
fentanyl
inside
a
reusable
shopping
bag;
two
airsoft
pistols
in
the
living room
area;
at
least
20
empty
hydrocodone
cough
syrup
bottles
in
the
kitchen;
4.32
grams of
powder
fentanyl
in
a
kitchen
cupboard
above
the
fridge,
along
with
two
measuring
cups with white powder residue, a spoon with white powder
residue, and a scale.
both counsel agree six years
should be imposed, globally, for these crimes. six years is a significant
penitentiary sentence. appellate courts have said significant penitentiary
sentences are necessary, in cases like these, to accomplish the sentencing
objectives of general deterrence and denunciation.
indeed,
general
deterrence
and
denunciation
must
be
at
the
forefront
of
sentences for gun and drug
trafficking crimes. the impact such crimes wreak on our community, demands no
less. mr. wright was engaged in the sale of poison by the point, during a time
where opiates are ripping our community apart in multiple ways.
opiate trafficking begets many
victims. direct victims of the opioid crisis, the addicted, are often unseen or
ignored. but before addiction took control, these victims had parents,
siblings, jobs, a home, people who loved them and who they loved back.
addiction
is
understood
as
when
substance
use
prevails,
despite
negative
consequences arising
from
that
same
use
–
the
loss
of
those
relationships,
that
job,
their
self-worth,
the people who loved them, their home, any
roof over their head at all.
truly, this is a wretched and sustained form of
victimization. mr. wright’s criminal activities contributed to that human
misery. drug trafficking has a strong and direct connection
to
property
crime committed in
our
community. mr.
wright’s
offending
played a part in
that. the sale of opioids also presses down on our over-burdened health care
system,
which
is
still
recovering
from
the
strain
of
covid-19.
his
offending
played
a
part in that.
in
r.
v.
parranto,
2021
scc
46
,
the
supreme
court
observed
at
para.
91
that
…the trafficking of hard drugs leads to
"significant if not staggering" costs to society in terms of health
care and law enforcement expenses, as well as lost productivity
(pushpanathan,
at
para.
89;
see
also
r.
v.
lloyd,
2016
scc
13
,
1 s.c.r. 130
, at para.
82
)
. in
2017, for example, it is estimated that abuse of opioids and cocaine in canada
resulted
in
total
costs
of
$9.6
billion
(
canadian
substance
use costs
and harms scientific working group, canadian substance use costs and harms (2015-2017)
(2020), at p. 1).
that
$9.6
billion
figure
is
built
on
the
foundation
of individual
opiate
sales,
point
by point.
the
scarce
government
resources
allocated
to
addiction
treatment
and
to
our
drug treatment
courts cannot keep up with the volume of increasing community need. mr.
wright’s offending contributed to this societal struggle and is most serious.
the seriousness
of mr.
wright’s
gun possession
must also
be
acknowledged. mr.
wright
is
a
victim
of
gun
violence
himself.
his
friends
have
died
because
of
gun
violence. back in 2005, prosecutors described the shocking
prevalence of shootings as “the summer of the gun”. now, innocent people get
shot on our streets often enough that it seems commonplace. mr. wright’s gun
crimes directly contributed to this incessant community victimization.
but it is error to focus on the seriousness of mr.
wright’s crimes to the exclusion of his future rehabilitation. he is
intelligent, hard-working, and ambitious. he has real potential
to
live
a
meaningful,
significant
life.
even
in
a
serious
case
like
this,
mr.
wright’s sentence cannot crush his hope
for rehabilitation. he must be able to see, and plan for, that light at the end
of the tunnel.
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
six
years
is
well
within
an
appropriate
range
of
sentence.
it
remained
so
after
aggravating and mitigating circumstances were weighed. the aggravating factors
were:
•
the nature and the quantum of
controlled substances he possessed.
these
were
highly
addictive
schedule
i
controlled substances.
on his person, coming home at 6 am, he was
carrying mdma and 47 oxycodone pills. inside the bedroom was fentanyl
adulterated with a benzodiazepine
.
heroin mixed with fentanyl was stored in the kitchen;
•
the amount of cash mr. wright had
on his person and inside the unit. the money totaled over $23 000. mr. wright
may have been a street level dealer, but his operation involved multiple
controlled substances and a relatively significant
volume;
•
the number of loose bullets found
in the closet, the fact that the
overcapacity
magazine
was
loaded,
and
the
two
air
pistols inside
the
living
room,
all
possessed,
at
least
in
part,
to
protect
his drug operation;
•
the impact his offending had on
our community. the crown aptly described mr. wright’s offending as contributing
to cycles of dispossession and violence that he, in his younger years,
struggled with and against. needles in parks, neighbourhoods rendered unsafe,
families broken apart, small businesses robbed. mr. wright’s offending contributed
to this ongoing victimization;
•
the risk that mr. wright took in
deciding to carry a loaded firearm on his person when out in public, before he
arrived back at
the
target unit.
it matters
little
that
he
did not use that firearm in public.
loading a firearm speaks to the intention to fire
it,
if
he
thought
it
“necessary”.
mr.
wright’s
decision
to
arm himself in public put
the lives of innocent community members, people that had nothing to do with the
drug trade, at risk.
the
mitigating
factors
were:
•
his relative youth
and lack of criminal record. when he committed
these
offences,
mr.
wright
was
about
24
years
old and he had no criminal record at that time.
•
mr. wright’s sincere expression of
remorse for his offending, coupled with the strong insight that he has shown
into his own behaviour. he expressed remorse to the
irca
report’s
author. additionally, he took the time to draft an insightful letter which expressed
his remorse and regret.
given
that
counsel
presented
a
joint
submission
on sentence,
his
letter
was
clearly
not
an
attempt
to
persuade the court to be lenient but the
output of his sincere
reflection;
•
the work he put into his own
rehabilitation while in presentence custody. when he was not being locked down
due to staff shortages, mr. wright was doing whatever he could, whenever he
could, to rehabilitate himself. the educational goals he achieved, in
particular, were meaningful and remarkable;
•
the conditions of his presentence
incarceration. he was locked down for approximately one-fifth of this time, and
triple bunked approximately ¼ of this time. i have expressed this mitigating
factor in the form of enhanced presentence custody credit: see para. 39.
sentence
imposed
six years in the penitentiary must be imposed upon mr.
wright, less the time already served against that quantum. as of the date of
sentencing submissions, mr. wright
served
the
equivalent
of
569
days,
employing
summers
credit.
he
served
this
time at the tedc and the
tsdc.
as of the date of sentencing
submissions, mr. wright had been triple bunked for about one-quarter of the
time in presentence custody. he was locked down, without access to rights like
visits or phone calls or fresh air, for about one-fifth of his time in
presentence custody.
these were the circumstances of his incarceration
during a time when he was presumed to be innocent. from a basic human rights
perspective, the circumstances of his
incarceration
were
inadequate.
i
felt
compelled
to
exercise
my
discretion
and
express
this mitigating factor in the form of enhanced presentence credit.
as of the date of sentencing
submissions, i found mr. wright had served the equivalent
of
733
days
against
his
global
sentence
of
six
years.
he
has
since
served,
with
summers
credit,
the
equivalent
of
another
10
days.
six
years
(2190
days)
less
733
days less
10
days
leaves
1,447
days
for
mr.
wright
still
to
serve.
a
dna
order
will
issue,
as
will
a s. 109 weapons prohibition order.
in conclusion, there is a joint submission before the
court that is within the appropriate range and i have imposed it. mr. wright’s
crimes called for a significant penalty. it also had to keep alive his hopes
for, and his prospects of, rehabilitation.
as
mr.
wright
serves
that
sentence,
it
is
my
own
hope
that
correctional
authorities see how strong his rehabilitative potential is. it
is my hope that his educational potential be given all the support the system
can possibly give. it is my hope that mr. wright becomes a success story.
certainly, he is more than capable of it.
