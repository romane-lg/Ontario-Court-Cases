on october 28, 2025 mr. smissaert
changed his plea on count #1 to guilty and maintained
his
not
guilty
pleas
for
the
balance
of
the
charges.
the
trial
commenced
with a
charter
application alleging that his rights were violated
under s. 8 as a result of the seizure of various firearms and related items on
april 4, 2025 by dc dikih.
those
seizures were taken, all agree, without prior judicial authorization.
the application commenced with the
crown calling evidence on the basis that a seizure without prior judicial
authorization is presumptively unreasonable,
see
hunter v. southam
1984 canlii 33 (scc)
,
2 s.c.r. 145
at p. 9 ,
r
. v. collins
1987 canlii 84 (scc)
,
1 s.c.r. 265
.
the crown therefore called evidence to
rebut that presumption.
overview
mr.
smissaert
is
now
64
years
old,
and
was
arrested
on
april
4,
2025
because
of a
voyeurism
allegation
by
his
tenant.
an
agreed
statement
of
fact
(asf),
accompanying
videos,
and
download
analysis
from his
two devices were
put into
evidence
on
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
smissaert
lives
on
bridge
street
in
carleton
place
which
is
where
the
voyeurism
occurred.
that address is a single
family dwelling on a corner, across from a church.
upon
arrest
mr.
smissaert
gave
a
statement
to
det
dikih
at
the
opp
detachment
in carlton place.
the video of the
statement shows mr. smissaert to talk openly about the
voyeurism
allegation.
det.
dikih
told
mr.
smissaert
that
the
police
would
request
a
3 day investigative hold for
him when he appeared before a justice the next day. the reason for that request
was to get a search warrant to search mr. smissaert’s house for electronic
devices connected with the voyeurism count.
at about
1 hour into the interview he was asked if there is anything
else he would like to disclose to the
officer. at that point he talked about various firearms he had in his house
which were not stored properly.
det
dikih then went, almost immediately, to mr. smissaert’s
house
with
det
cst.
pineau
and
seized
the
firearms,
various
parts
and
pieces
of
ammunition.
there
was
no
prior
judicial
authorization
for
that
entry,
although
there
was a search warrant obtained and
executed at the house some days later.
the
interview
mr.
smissaert
told
det.
dikih
that
“i
have
rifles
that
are
unregistered
they’re
hunting
rifles…i got three…they’re somewhat hidden in the house but you know you’re
going to find them”.
he denies that
he is under any firearms prohibition, and said that he didn’t have a hunting
licence.
he
had the 12 gauge shotgun since he was probably twenty years
old,
and
he
got
the
other
hunting
rifle
from
his
uncle
maybe
15
or
20
years
ago.
he didn’t register them because he
disagreed with the government’s firearms registrations scheme.
he bought one of them in 1979 or 1980 when
he was in the military.
mr. smissaert continued that
“…one’s a bolt action one’s just gas operated you know semi-automatic”. one of
the rifles was his father’s m1 carbine, which was passed along to him via his
uncle.
the rifles are hidden in a
closet and “…you won’t have any problem finding…they’re not in a locked locker
or nothing like that”.
he
admitted
to
not
having
a
licence
for
the
weapons.
in
the
interview
det.
dikih
was
asked
why
this
was
relevant,
and
replied
“…why
it’s
a
very
simple
explanation
because
people’s
homes
get
broken
into
all
the
time…right
now you’re in police custody right which
means your house is going to be vacant because you’re
not
at
home
tonight
or
tomorrow
night
and
if
somebody
breaks
in
you
just
enabled them
because good people don’t break into people’s houses…”.
as
the
interview
progressed
mr.
smissaert
confirmed
that
nobody
knows
about
the guns, not even the
complainant who was living in the house with him before his arrest. his house
has never been broken into.
det. dikih was candid with mr.
smissaert, saying that “…i can guarantee we’re going
to
take
them
we’re
going
to
seize
them
because
you’re
not
lawfully
allowed
to
have it plus you’re not
storing it properly which we can’t ignore because then i’ll be breaking the
law”.
mr. smissaert disclosed more about
his background, he is a canadian forces veteran, was stationed in gagetown and
discharged in 1984 because of an injury.
det.
dikih
asked
him,
“i
would
it
expect
you
to
store
it
properly
though
just
saying
as
a
solder
i would expect you to store that properly”.
mr.
smissaert replied “well they were stored properly
but again not locked up or
nothing”.
the bolt of one is
out and the rifles are not fireable.
ammunition was in the house – “a good pile”.
mr. smissaert told det. dikih that
he “…had the rifles legally and you could buy (ammunition)
at
canadian
tire”.
he
said
“…no
i
had
an
fac
before”.
he
didn’t
renew
his
fac,
because
“…the
whole
process
uh
the
fac
uh
was
changed
to
the
pal
uh
uh
like
i don’t
know
all
this
but
there
is
no
fac
anymore
you
get
a
pal”
he
simply
did
not
get
his
pal because his son lost interest (in hunting).
i
take
this
to
mean
that
fac
is
the
older
firearms
permit
and
short
form
for
firearms acquisition certificate, and pal
to be the current possession acquisition licence under the
firearms act
s.c.
1995 c. 39 as amended.
although not
argued in this application, an fac is deemed to expire after 5 years, see
firearms
act
s. 120.
mr. smissaert
therefore
told
det.
dikih
that
his
firearms
permits
had
expired,
and
on
his
statement,
that would have been many years ago.
det
dikih
was
asked
by
mr.
smissaert
if
he
had
to
stay
“here”
overnight.
det
dikih said,
“…that’s
a
pretty
simple
question…because
we’re
going
to
we’re
going
to
request
a three day investigative hold which means it gives us a chance to write
a warrant…and then execute it and search the house.”
det dikih then went to mr.
smissaert’s residence with dc pineau and, using the information
mr.
smissaert
gave
them
during
the
statement,
seized
the
weapons.
he
said
in
evidence
that
it
was
a
matter
of
exigent
circumstances.
he
had
no
warrant
to
enter
mr. smissaert’s residence or to seize
anything at the time.
the body
worn camera (bwc)
from
dc
pineau shows the two officers
arrive at the back door to the house, enter and go directly to the front
entrance and search the closet
in
the
front
entrance.
almost
immediately
they
find
long
arms.
first
a
b

gun
and
next two hunting rifles.
they are
extracted from the closet and put on the living room floor.
the
two
officers
then
proceed
to
the
rear
room
which
is
quite
cluttered.
they
find
a
large box covered by some things, open the box, and find ammunition, rifle
bolts and a magazine for a military fn rifle.
dets.
dikih
and
pineau
entered
mr.
smissaert’s
home
at
6:35
pm
and
left
with
the
firearms and seized ammunition and parts at 6:55. by 7 pm the two officers were
at the carleton
place
o.p.p.
detachment
processing
the
guns.
on
the
evidence
played
in
court the
20
minute
search
inside
mr.
smissaert’s
home
was
focused
entirely
on
seizure
of
the guns
and
related
parts
and
ammunition.
once
the
two
officers
found
those
items
they
left
right away.
det. dikih testified at the
application.
he was asked about why
he decided to go into
mr.
smissaert’s
home
to
seize
the
weapons
before
getting
a
search
warrant.
he
gave several grounds for
that decision:
i)
exigent
circumstances:
namely
the
presence
of
four
firearms
stored
without trigger locks,
with readily accessible ammunition, and not secured in a safe
manner;
ii)
unlocked
residence:
mr.
smissaert
disclosed
that
the
rear
door
of
the
residence was unlocked, which increasing
the risk of unauthorized access.
iii)
risk of theft and harm: concern that someone could
enter the home, steal the firearms,
and
use
them
to
harm
others.
det.
dikih
was
concerned
about
break-
ins and shootings in the community.
iv)
delay
in
obtaining
a
warrant:
preparing
and
obtaining
a
telewarrant
could
take
several hours to days. det. dikih decided not to wait.
v)
public
visibility
of
arrest:
the
accused
was
arrested
in
public
view,
which
could alert others to
the unsecured residence.
det. dikih also spoke of alternate
strategies to secure the scene.
he
could have called for other
officers
to secure the scene.
depending on
what else was
happening in the
detachment area it may have been granted or not.
he did not make inquiries about the
availability
of
other
police
assets
to
secure
the
scene.
in
his
evidence
before
me,
det.
dikih
emphasized
that
his
decision
was
based
solely
on
public
safety,
not
the
nature of the charges. he was clear:
'looking back i would make this decision every time.'
legal
framework
on this
charter
application
the operative provision of the
criminal code
is
s. 117.04(2)
. it permits
a warrantless seizure of firearms.
117.04(2)
search
and
seizure
without
warrant
(2)
where, with respect to any person, a peace
officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it is
not desirable, in the interests of the safety
of the person or any other person, for the person to possess any weapon,
prohibited device, firearm part, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive
substance, the peace officer may, where the grounds for obtaining a warrant
under subsection (1) exist but, by reason of a possible danger to the safety of
that person or any other person, it would not be practicable to obtain a
warrant, search for and seize any such thing, and any authorization, licence or
registration certificate
relating
to
any
such
thing,
that
is
held
by
or
in
the
possession
of the person.
this
version
of
s.
117.04(2)
is
fairly
new.
it
received
royal
assent
in
late
2023,
and
came into force on january 14, 2024 some 16 months before the events in this
case. notably the current version of s. 117.04 permits warrantless seizure of a
firearm part, which the older version did not.
it appears that the language of the current s. 117.04 mirrors the older
version of s. 117.04 other than that.
there
are
three
essential
elements
to
s.
117.04(2):
the
peace
officer
must
1)
have reasonable grounds to believe that
it is not desirable for a person to have a firearm or device; 2) that the peace
officer has reasonable grounds to seize said items under the authority of a
warrant; and 3) that by reason of the possible danger to the safety of the
person or others make it not practicable to obtain a warrant to seize the
items.
when it says
“…
by
reason of
…”
the text of
the statute connects
the
impracticality of obtaining a warrant
to
the possible danger to the safety of the person or others.
ms. bedar takes no issue with the
first two parts of the test.
she
agrees that the police had reasonable grounds to believe that it was not
desirable for
mr. smissaert to have
the rifles.
she also agrees that the
police had reasonable grounds to believe that the
police
had
reasonable
grounds
to
seize
the
guns
and
ammunition
under
the
authority of a warrant.
these are fair admissions.
the last
requirement is really in issue here, namely “
by reason of
a
possible
danger to
the
safety of
that
person
or any other
person, it would not be practicable to obtain a warrant, search
for and seize any such thing, and any
authorization,
licence
or
registration
certificate
relating
to
any
such
thing,
that
is
held by or in the possession of the person”.
emphasis
added
there
is
a
dearth
of
authoritative
rulings
on
the
interpretation
of
s.
117.04(2).
r.
v
peacock-mcdonald
2007 onca 128
is the lone appellate decision which
considers the predecessor section – though the change in language from the 2023
amendment is immaterial for present purposes.
in
peacock-mcdonald
the appellant had been apprehended under the
mental health act (mha) and taken to a local hospital for a psychiatric
assessment.
the police believed her
to be suicidal. the appellant was not charged with an offence but the police
found out at the hospital that the appellant had a firearms
licence
and
had
on
her
keys
to
her
firearms
cabinet
in
her
house.
there
was
no
sense that the appellant had committed any
crime
whatsoever but she was suicidal and had access to guns in her home.
with that the police entered her home
under the authority of s. 117.04(2) and seized the guns. the appellant claimed,
on her forfeiture application under s. 117.05, that the police violated her s.
8 rights by seizing the guns without
a
warrant.
at
first
instance
chester
j.
found
no
charter
violation.
this
was
upheld
on appeal.
what is apparent in the ruling is
that the police had no realistic ability to obtain a warrant
and
seize
the
guns
before
the
appellant
would
be
released
from
the
hospital.
key in the ruling (at par. 32) is that a mha apprehension could end any
time if a physician cleared
the
patient
to
leave.
the
police
had
no
control
over
the
appellant’s
liberty
to
return home and access her guns.
she was held on the strength of a medical
apprehension, not a police detention or arrest.
as the court said,
28.
moreover, nothing on this record suggests that there was any
realistic opportunity
for the police
to
obtain a
warrant in the time that
elapsed
between the appellant's arrival at the
hospital and the completion of the search carried out by officer
allore.
the
officer
testified
that
the
time
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant for a residence could vary from
"as little as four or five hours to two days or more sometimes of trying
to confirm your grounds...and articulate it".
he also said that
he
did not know for sure whether the
appellant
was going
to be assessed until he
got
back
to
the
hospital
after
seizing
her
firearms
and
that,
if
she
were
released,
it
would be too late to seize them.
29
in my view, when public safety issues are implicated, as in
this case, the police should not be required to speculate upon the timing of
the release from hospital of a person in the appellant's position in the hope
that they might secure a warrant for the seizure of firearms in the possession
of the detainee before that release.
matters of public safety, when firearms
are involved, should not depend
on guesswork; nor are they a 'race to
the swiftest'.
emphasis
added
peacock-mcdonald
is
therefore
a
case
about
appellate
deference
to
lower
courts, see par. 36. i do not take the
court of appeal to have handed down an interpretative ruling.
peacock-mcdonald
is
one
of
many
cases
dealing
with
the
seizure
of
firearms
from persons with mental health
challenges facing no criminal charges, and therefore not under detention or
arrest, see for
eg
wojcik v. r
.
2025 nbca 46
,
r. v. dupree
2025 oncj 18
,
r. v. schill
2024 oncj
249
,
r. v. tereck
2008 mbca 90
(at par.
31
) though not a s. 117.04(2)
decision.
it is not surprising that s.
117.04(2) decisions should so often be applied in the mental health crisis
situation.
what is common in
this line of authority is the police
inability to control the movement of a firearm owner who lawfully
possesses guns,
and who is
in
a
suicidal
state.
s.
117.04(2) seems designed
for
that
very purpose.
with
that said, application of s. 117.04(2) is
not confined to that fact pattern.
in
r. v. k.h.
2016 onsc 5275
the court scrutinized
the officers’ basis to avail themselves of the s. 117.04(2) authority.
in that case the police were investigating
a stolen police handgun.
that
investigation lead them to believe that the gun was at a house,
unsecured
and
that
there
were
five
people
in
the
house.
if
k.h.
is
not
on
all
fours with
the
case
at
bar
it
is
very
close
to
it.
roger
j.
rejected
the
police
reasons
as
meeting the standard under
s. 117.04(2), saying,
67.
the gun had presumptively been with the applicant for close to
one
month
without incident. the applicant was polite, friendly and cooperative. the
officers indicated
that
they
had
no
reasons
not
to
trust
him
when
he
told
them
that
the
gun was hidden and only he knew where it
was. the applicant was with the officers and the officers testified that, at
this point, they would not allow him to call home or return home. the person
with psychiatric issues was not in the home and only family
members
were
in
the
home.
the
applicant
and
the
applicant's
son
were
not known
criminals
and
no
known
criminal
or
any
otherwise
presumptively
dangerous person was known to
be in the home.
the concerns raised by
the
officers are not
supported
by the circumstances that existed at the time. to conclude otherwise
would
allow warrantless searches based upon exigent circumstances where the
risk
is premised on mere speculation and extremely remote possibilities. as an
aside,
the casual manner in which the officers entered the residence does not
assist
their argument of exigent circumstances.
68
there was essentially no change in earlier circumstances and
the opp, in the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances,
should
have
proceeded
to
obtain
a
warrant
on
an
expedited
basis,
taking
whatever
steps
they
deemed
appropriate
to
contain the
scene. consequently, in my view this was an unreasonable search and
seizure.
emphasis
added
i also find that, while the s.
117.04 (2) provision does not itself contain the words “exigent circumstances”
it is clearly about
that.
other parts of criminal law legislation
contain
similar
provisions,
see
for
eg.
controlled
drugs
and
substances
act
(cdsa)
s.c. 1996 c.
19 as
amended,
s.
11(7)
which
does
contain
the
words
“exigent
circumstances”.
the warrantless
power
to enter a dwelling under “exigent
circumstances” under s. 529.3 of the
code
is another.
what
differentiates
s.
117.04(2)
from
s.
529.3
and
s.
11(7)
of
the
cdsa
is
that
in
s.
117.04(2)
parliament
has
seen
fit
to
particularize
the
test,
namely,
by reason of a
possible danger to the safety
of that person or any other person, it
would
not
be
practicable to
obtain
a
warrant,
search
for
and
seize
any
such thing, and any
authorization,
licence or
registration
certificate relating to
any
such
thing, that is held by or in the possession of the person.
in
s.
529.3
and
s.
11(7)
of
the
cdsa
parliament
simply
said
exigent
circumstances
were sufficient to conduct a warrantless
search in those two situations.
not
every legislative
instance
of
exigent
circumstances
is
the
same.
none
have
the
same
standard,
see
r. v. paterson
2017 scc 15
at pars. 29 – 34.
despite the differing language in
the enabling legislation
i find it
helpful to use jurisprudence
considering
the
language
of
“exigent
circumstances”
to
interpret
s.
117.04.
in
r. v. campbell
2024 scc 42
the court considered exigent circumstances
in s. 11(7) of
the
cdsa.
there
the
police
had
seized
electronic
devices
from
the
accused
which
told them that a drug deal
involving
fentanyl was about to
be completed.
the exigency lay in the immediacy
of a
deal
involving
“deadly
drugs”
which
“would
have
been
trafficked to vulnerable drug users in the
community imminently”
see
campbell
at par.
137 - 138
.
in
r.
v.
paterson
(supra)
brown
j.,
referring
to the
cdsa,
said
that,
37. in sum, i conclude that, in
order for a warrantless entry to satisfy
s. 11(7)
, the crown must show
that
the entry
was
compelled
by
urgency, calling
for
immediate
police action to preserve evidence, officer safety or public safety. further,
this urgency
must
be
shown
to
have
been
such
that
taking
the
time
to
obtain
a
warrant
would pose serious risk to those imperatives.
other senior appellate courts have
interpreted exigent circumstances to be
“extraordinary”
and should be invoked “only where necessary”,
see
r. v. kelsy
2011 onca
605
at par.
35
.
i therefore find that, in law, the
test for invoking s. 117.04(2) must include similar urgency, as identified by
the courts
in
campbell
,
paterson, and kelsy
.
that finding includes
the similar
public
safety
concerns
animating both s.
117.04(2)
and
the
cdsa
s. 11(7).
release of
toxic drugs like fentanyl (per
campbell
) is every bit as concerning as
access to firearms by someone who poses a danger with a gun in hand.
all that is different is the mechanism by
which public safety is endangered.
that
symmetry of concern informs the constitutional test by which warrantless
seizure can occur in either situation. it has urgency at its center.
the possible danger test in s.
117.04 (2) is therefore informed
by
that urgency.
in order to satisfy s.
117.04(2) the crown must show a possible danger which was real. a theoretical
danger
is
insufficient.
a
speculative
danger
is
insufficient.
i
would
borrow
from the court of appeal’s dicta
in
r. v. golub
1997 canlii 6316 (on ca)
,
102
o.a.c 176
and consider: the
nature of
the potential danger; the potential consequences of not seizing
the firearms; the availability
of
alternative measures; and the likelihood of the contemplated danger actually
existing,
see
golub
at par.
48
.
in
golub
the court was considering
the basis on which a police officer can
enter
a
dwelling
to
search incident
to
arrest
without
a
warrant,
but
the
test
fits well in this context.
i
find
that
the
“possible
danger”
test
in
s.
117.04
is
met
when
the
police
have
no
to
little control over access to the firearms. this is particularly so when the
police have a constellation of discernable facts that an identifiable person
has access to the guns – someone who poses a public danger in that situation,
and there is insufficient time to obtain
a
warrant.
in
such
situations
s.
117.04(2)
furnishes
the
police
with
lawful
grounds to seize guns without a warrant.
ayotte j. found that this provision is
preventative in nature, concerned
with
the situation where
the potential
for
violence
is
real,
even
though
it has not occurred,
see
r.v robinz
2022 abpc 159
. i agree.
mcdonald-peacock
is therefore a case where that real danger is met by
the certainty that a suicidal person will have access to guns and the police
are otherwise powerless
to
prevent
it.
the
combination
of
those
two
discernible
facts
was
sufficient
to meet the possible danger threshold for warrantless entry in
s. 117.04(2).
in
r. v. lafond
2012 oncj 661
(at par.
264
), the
co-existence of children in the house with unlocked firearms, and allegations
of domestic violence were sufficient to lawfully engage s. 117.04(2). there was
no s. 8
charter
violation in the warrantless seizure of guns.
against
this
legal
background
i
am
prepared
to
make
the
following
findings.
1)
in his evidence sgt. dikih cast
the possible danger from the unsecured
firearms as coming from someone who might break into mr. smissaert’s house,
find the guns and steal them.
he testified
that someone might have seen mr. smissaert getting arrested and might have used
his arrest to break into his home.
i
find
that
this
is
quite
speculative.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
knew
that
mr. smissaert had the guns.
the tenant who was the complainant did not
know of them according to the evidence before me.
the only person who saw mr. smissaert interact with the police
was his
neighbour, and det. pineau
only asked the neighbour if he had seen mr. smissaert.
det. pineau did not tell him mr. smissaert was to be arrested.
oddly, when mr. smissaert was arrested he
was not handcuffed.
if anyone had
seen mr. smissaert’s arrest they would not have seen one of the universal
indicia
of a police arrest, namely the handcuffing of the arrestee. in other words
the arrest of mr. smissaert outside his home would not have clearly presented
to an observer as an arrest.
i therefore find that det.
dikih’s concern about someone seeing mr. smissaert’s arrest
was
speculative.
it
is
equally
speculative
to
say
that
seeing
his
arrest
would have
lead
to
a
break
in.
simply
put
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
was
planning
to break into mr. smissaert’s residence.
no
one knew the guns were there.
the
house was empty and no one else was expected to enter.
to sum up, the danger posed by
the guns in the house was theoretical, or speculative and not real.
2)
mr.
smissaert
on
the
evidence
before
me,
possessed
guns
with
no
current
licence. it appears that he was licenced
in the past but did not keep his licencing current. his licences appear to have
lapsed many years ago.
from his
statement to det. dikih
mr.
smissaert
said
that
the
guns
had
been
in
their
current
location
for
years. no
one
knew
about
them.
he
appears
to
have
been
a
retired
member
of
thecanadian forces.
there is
no evidence
of gang or
criminal
element
associations to mr. smissaert.
3)
it is a significant obstacle in
the crown’s attempt to justify the reasonableness of the seizure that det.
dikih did nothing to secure the scene once he learned that the house had rifles
in it.
he did not alert anyone at the
opp other than det. pineau
that
there
was
a
possible
danger
in
the
unsecured
firearms
at
the
house
– and
det
pineau
was
there
to
provide
assistance
in
the
firearms
seizure.
det.
dikih made
no
request
for
an
officer
to
secure
the
scene,
pending
a
warrant
application.
with mr. smissaert in custody
and the complainant apparently uninterested in returning
to
the
home
where
she
was
filmed in private
there
was
no
one
else
who would
enter
the
home.
the
guns
were
in
an
empty
house
while
mr.
smissaert
was in
custody
pending
his
first
appearance.
det.
dikih
was
candid
with
mr.
smissaert that he would be asking the
crown to request a 3 day hold for a search warrant. in any event, the police
had until approximately noon the next day before mr. smissaert was required to
appear before a justice.
that left
some 18 hours to apply for a warrant to seize the guns while mr. smissaert was
in police custody. given the nature of the voyeurism allegations it was
reasonable to infer that a longer hold would have been granted while the police
obtained a warrant for electronic devices still in the house.
i struggle with det. dikih’s
evidence that if he had asked for assistance to secure the scene it might not
have been granted.
that amounts to
saying that a police detective’s
concern
about
a
danger
to
public
safety
would
not
be
so
concerning
to others in his unit to the point where other police assets
would be deployed to secure the scene.
there is in my finding no real
reason why another officer in a police car could not have been sent to mr.
smissaert’s house to ensure that no one entered while a warrant was
applied for.
the
video
of
the
house does
not
support
a
finding that it was a
difficult location
to secure.
i find the
opposite,
that it would
have
been
very easy for another officer
to monitor the house to ensure that no stranger
went in while a warrant was being applied for.
i would infer that anyone thinking about
breaking into a house would be deterred by the presence of a police car at the
curb.
while i have found that there
was no real danger posed by the guns in the house when
mr. smissaert
was
in
police
custody, if
i had,
the
ability
to secure the
scene pending a
warrant application made such a warrant application straightforward. this court
operates a telewarrant center 24 hours a day for such situations. a justice
of
the
peace
is
always
available
to
consider
conventional
warrants
outside of
normal court hours.
det. dikih
referred to this in his evidence.
i
do not find that
the
situation
made
it
impracticable
to
apply
for
a
warrant.
to
the
contrary
i
find that that could have been completed
very easily.
4)
det. dikih was candid in his
testimony about the reasons he seized the firearms that evening.
he made no attempt to distance himself
from that part of the investigation.
as
he said in
his evidence “
…i
would
do
that same
thing
again…”.
for these reasons i find that mr.
smissaert’s
charter
rights were violated.
the police
did
not
satisfy
the
warrantless
seizure
test
in
s.
117.04(2).
the
warrantless
seizure in the circumstances violated mr.
smissaert’s s. 8 rights.
section
24(2)
taking
the
three
part
test
under
r.
v.
grant
2009
scc
32
i
find
that
sgt.
dikih
had
the grounds to obtain a warrant.
i
find that the s. 8 violation lay in his decision to enter mr. smissaert’s home
without a warrant instead of making a conventional warrant application.
on the first prong of
grant
it is
aggravating that det. dikih did not explore other
alternatives to a
warrantless
entry into
a private
dwelling.
it
is mitigating
that there is
a
dearth
of
appellate
authority
on
which
the
police
can
be
expected
to
know
the
test
to apply when considering s. 117.04(2).
i take as neutral that det. dikih
testified that he would do the same thing again.
on one hand his candour
meets
the standard expected of
police
detectives,
but
with
that
said,
it
is
somewhat
concerning
that
his
testimony
does not permit the idea that he may have
proceeded in violation of a constitutional standard.
i
would
therefore
find
that
the
first
prong
of
grant
modestly
favour
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
the impact on mr. smissaert’s
charter
protected interests was limited on the evidence before me.
he was held in custody pending bail while
a search warrant was duly
applied
for
and
executed.
the
warrantless
entry
therefore
merely
advanced
seizure of guns which would have been found when the warrant was
executed later.
i assume that if det.
dikih had not gone in with det. pineau on the friday night that seizure of the
guns
would
have
been
included
in
the
search
warrant
which
was
applied
for
later.
given that no one was home during that
time the location remained static. i take into consideration that the friday
evening search by dets dikih and pineau was focussed entirely on the guns.
they searched for nothing else and left once
they had seized the guns, ammunition and items.
the second prong of
grant
favours admission of the
evidence.
society always has an interest in
the adjudication of a trial on the merits.
the
question
is
by
how
much.
i
find
that
this
case
involved
a
former
hunter
who
held
his
guns unsafely and had let his firearms
permits expire.
let there be no
mistake that those are serious criminal offences.
but this case falls closer to the regulatory side as gun cases
go, and is some distance from a true crime situation.
apart from the lack of permit, and unsafe storage there is
nothing on these facts to suggest that mr. smissaert’s rifles, ammunition
or
rifle
parts
would
be
used
in
a
violent
crime.
i
also
find
that
the
context
of this
charter
application is the seizure of
hunting rifles in a geographic area where
lawful hunting is common.
the third
prong of
grant
favours exclusion of evidence.
the balancing required of the
court in the s. 24(2) analysis is discretionary.
no two
judges
will
necessarily
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
see.

.
putting
the
three
factors
of
grant
together i have no difficulty in
excluding the evidence.
this
charter
application
was
well
prepared
and
well
argued.
