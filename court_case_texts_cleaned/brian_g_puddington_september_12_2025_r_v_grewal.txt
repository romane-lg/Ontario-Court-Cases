1.         introduction
on july
6th, 2024, police obtained three search warrants under
s. 11
of the
controlled
drugs and substances act
sc 1996 c. 19 (cdsa) for two residences and a
motor vehicle associated with the accused, gavin leon. on the same day, and
before executing those warrants, police officers went to mr. leon’s neighbourhood
and located him driving the vehicle. they followed mr. leon to several areas
and, when he entered a convenience store near pape and danforth, they arrested
him without incident.
a
search of mr. leon’s bag incident to arrest uncovered a loaded firearm and a
separate magazine with eight rounds of ammunition.
police
then proceeded to execute the three search warrants.
nothing
of any evidentiary value was seized from the residences. when police executed
the warrant on the motor vehicle two days later, they seized from the trunk of
his car another firearm loaded with an over capacity magazine and two
additional over capacity magazines, one of which was loaded with ammunition, as
well as a handgun suppressor, other ammunition and some fentanyl residue.
mr.
leon was charged with 19 firearms related offences
.  he was not
charged with any drug-related offences.
mr.
leon challenges the validity of the search warrants and the search incident to
arrest and seeks to exclude the evidence seized pursuant to s.24(2) of the
charter
on the basis that his s. 8 rights were violated. he says that the warrants could
not have issued because the information to obtain (ito) failed to disclose reasonable
grounds to believe that the items sought would be at the places to be searched.
resting on the same premise, mr. leon also says that the police did not have
the necessary reasonable grounds to believe he had committed an offence, thus
making his arrest unlawful and the search incident to that arrest a violation
of s. 8.
the
crown resists the application and submits that the grounds in the ito were  sufficient
for the warrants to issue and for the arrest to have been made. even if they
were not, the crown submits, the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2).
these
reasons explain why i agree with mr. leon. in my view, on the record before me,
including the excised version of the ito, these search warrants could not have
issued.
dependent
as it is on the information provided by a single confidential informant (ci),
the ito in support of the warrants fails to provide a sufficient basis for the
issuing justice, acting reasonably, to conclude that the information provided
by the ci was credible, compelling and corroborated. it amounted to nothing
more then an unverified generalized tip. it was not enough to allow a justice
to find that the items sought in appendix “a” of the ito would be found at the
places to be searched. mr. leon’s residences and vehicle were therefore
searched in violation of his s. 8 rights.
equally,
the police were not possessed with reasonable grounds to arrest mr. leon for
anything. the search incident to that arrest was also a breach of s. 8.
this
was a serious violation with a multi-pronged impact on mr. leon’s
charter
-
protected interests. notwithstanding its importance to the crown’s case and the
significant public interest in the prosecution of these charges, i conclude
that the evidence seized must be excluded under s. 24(2) of the
charter
.
2.
the
procedural background
all
three warrants relied on a single ito. the ito relied upon information from a
single confidential source. as a result, portions of the ito were redacted.
the crown
conceded that the redacted version of the ito did not set out sufficient
grounds to justify the issuance of the warrants and sought to rely on the
six-step procedure set out
in
r. v. garofoli
.
in
accordance with that procedure the defence was provided with a redacted version
of the ito and a judicial summary of the redactions, which was prepared by the
crown and refined with judicial input in an
ex parte
and
in camera
proceeding.
mr. leon conceded that the judicial summary allowed the defence to be sufficiently
aware of the nature of the redacted material to challenge it in argument or by
evidence. as a result, the s. 8 challenge proceeded on the basis that i could
consider the ito in its entirety, including the redacted portions.
there
was also a further and less common application incidental to the
garofoli
proceedings. the defence applied for a declaration that the confidential source
relied on  in the ito was not a
bona fide
informant but was instead an
agent of the police and not entitled to the protection of privilege afforded by
virtue of being a confidential informant. this is sometimes referred to as a
basi
hearing.
the
defence filed an affidavit from mr. leon
describing the basis upon which he believed that the person thought to be the
ci was an agent. the crown filed an affidavit from a detective in the
intelligence unit
which essentially outlined the factual basis upon which the crown would submit
that whomever the ci was, they were not a police agent. i provided a judicial
summary of the redacted portions of that brief affidavit to the defence.
i
agreed that there was a basis to conduct such a hearing and proceeded to hear
from one witness, who was the handler for the ci. i then provided a judicial
summary of the evidence heard in that proceeding to the defence.
armed
with the redacted ito, the judicial summary of the redactions in the ito, the
redacted affidavit from the intelligence unit and the associated summary, as
well as some additional disclosure of source material provided by the handler
to the affiant, the parties made submissions on whether the warrants could have
issued.
where
it is necessary for me to refer to redacted portions of the materials in these
reasons in order to fully explain my conclusions, i have done so in endnotes. a
copy of these reasons with the endnotes redacted will be provided to mr. leon
and can be publicly disseminated. an unredacted version will be made a sealed
lettered exhibit so that it will be available to any reviewing court. an
unredacted version will also be provided to crown counsel.
3.         the legal
principles governing the review of search warrants
a
search warrant is presumptively valid.
the burden is on the applicant challenging the warrant to demonstrate that the
minimum standard of reasonable and probable grounds has not been met.
these
warrants were granted pursuant to
s.11
of the
cdsa
, which requires that
there be “reasonable grounds to believe” that a controlled substance or offence
related property will be found at a named place. the phrase “reasonable grounds
to believe” does not require proof on the balance of probabilities. the
statutory and constitutional standard is one of credibly-based probability.
a
warrant that is issued based on an ito that fails to disclose the necessary
statutory prerequisites is facially invalid. a warrant is sub-facially invalid
if information not before the issuing justice is added to the record, or
information that should not have been before the issuing justice that is
excised, renders the issuance of the warrant unsupportable or demonstrates that
the
affiant
deliberately, or at least recklessly, misled the issuing judge, rendering the
entire ito unreliable.
the
ultimate question on the s. 8 challenge to the warrants is not whether the
reviewing justice would have
issued the warrants. rather, the question
is whether, based upon the record that was before the issuing justice as
amplified and excised by the evidence adduced at this hearing, the warrants
could
have issued.
in
reviewing a warrant for sufficiency the reviewing justice should adopt a
“common sense and holistic approach.”
where,
as here, the ito relies on information from a confidential source, a review of
the grounds for the issuance of the warrants requires consideration of what is
commonly referred to as the
debot
criteria,
or the
“three cs”: was the source information credible, compelling and corroborated?
in assessing the extent to which the information provided by the source meets
the
debot
criteria, the totality of the circumstances must be
considered. no one factor is determinative, and weaknesses in one area may be
compensated for by strength in the others.
4.         the information to obtain
the
ito is not lengthy. it bears repeating the basic point, however, that the items
sought as described in appendix “a” to both the warrants and the ito were the
typical drug-related items: controlled substances, drug paraphernalia,
proceeds, debt lists etc. the warrants did not authorize the seizure of any
firearms.
after
attesting to mr. leon’s known residences and a vehicle registered in his name,
appendix “c” of the ito proceeds to introduce the affiant who asserts his
opinion that “much of the information provided by the confidential source(s)
has been corroborated through police sources and surveillance leading me to
believe the information is compelling in nature.”
the
ito then describes mr. leon’s arrest three and a half years earlier in january
2021 in which drugs and a handgun were discovered in the same vehicle for which
a warrant was being sought in this case. mr. leon was charged in relation to those
items. the ito discloses that those charges are still outstanding, and the
affiant notes that including this information is “not an assessment of
character by showing involvement
with police, but rather used as a way to
corroborate information of leon.”
the
ito goes on to describe observations of mr. leon’s movements in and around his
residences in the two weeks leading up to the warrant application.
the
affiant proceeds to describe his general beliefs about why the items sought
would afford evidence of an offence and why they could be found at the places
to be searched. the affiant’s sub-heading sums it up: “people keep personal
items in their personal
places.”
the affiant concludes appendix “c” by reasserting his personal belief that the
items sought would be found at the places to be searched.
appendix
“d” of the ito relates information about and received from the ci. i will
address the specifics of that information in my analysis of the sufficiency of
the grounds, below.
at
the end of appendix “d”, following the affiant’s description of the male about
whom he is providing information, his possession of a firearm and the possible location
of drugs, the affiant states the following (which was unredacted in the course
of the preparation of the judicial summary):
at this time it is
unknown how many people know about the firearm observed by the confidential
source. in order to protect the confidential source’s identity, i am only
seeking a
controlled drugs and substances act
search warrant as i do not
wish to inadvertently identify or narrow the pool of individuals that the
confidential source could be, which would occur by drafting a
criminal code
search warrant for the firearm(s). the information related to the firearm(s) is
also dated and i am unable to corroborate that part of the information any
further at this point of the investigation.
appendix
“e” provides information about the ci’s history.
the
judicial summary says that appendix “e” discloses that “this is the first time
the ci has provided information to the police.” in the affidavit of the
detective
in the intelligence unit filed on the application for a
basi
hearing,
the affiant says that they reviewed the “source file” for the ci and confirmed
that the ci had provided information on what the judicial summary of that
affidavit described as “a specific number” of occasions, which is “significantly
different” than information provided in the ito.
[i]
the
crown acknowledges that the assertion in the ito that this was the first time the
ci had provided information to the police is factually incorrect. as a result,
this part of appendix “e” of the ito was excised from the ito for the purposes
of the review.
5.         the s. 8 breach
the
information provided by the ci touching on mr. leon’s possession of any of the
items sought in appendix “a” is minimal. it is described it in detail in the
endnotes.
[ii]
the
ci provided other information about the male he was describing, namely the two
addresses where he had lived, some information about his tenuous connection to
other criminal acts, and that the male had recently become a father.
in
sum, the information provided by the ci as described in the endnotes, as well
as the fact that mr. leon was facing outstanding gun charges arising from his
arrest in january 2021, and the affiant’s personal belief based on experience
that people keep personal items in their cars and houses, are the sum total of
information available to the issuing justice on the question of whether the
items listed in appendix “a” — drugs and drug paraphernalia  —  would be found
at the places to be searched.
the
affiant repeatedly states that information provided by the ci had been
corroborated by police sources. he also says, as i have described earlier, that
the description of what led to mr. leon being charged in january 2021 is
provided “to corroborate information of leon.” i do not understand what this reference
to corroboration means. the phrase is highly ambiguous. if the affiant means
that this 2021 arrest is somehow corroborative of the information provided by
the ci about mr. leon’s current possession of drugs, i respectfully disagree. the
ito fails to disclose any meaningful corroboration of the ci’s information.
while
i accept that reasonable grounds do not necessitate corroboration of the very
criminality of the information given by the tipster, the only corroboration in
this instance is of information that would be known to any number of people in
mr. leon’s community. as doherty ja put it
in
r. v. lewis
:
absent
confirmation of details other than details which describe innocent and
commonplace conduct, information supplied by an untested, anonymous informant
cannot, standing alone, provide reasonable grounds for an arrest or search.
i
appreciate that the ci in this case is not anonymous. but similar concerns
apply with respect to the corroboration of details provided even by a known
source. any member of mr. leon’s community could have provided the innocent
details related by the ci in this case.
nor
is the information provided by the ci compelling. it is at the most extreme
level of generality with respect to what contraband might be found. any
reference by the affiant to his belief that mr. leon was in possession of a
particular drug has no support in the ito. the information with respect to
where any illegal items might be found is general and it is also contradictory.
nor is there any indication that the ci is relying on firsthand observations of
criminality, not to mention instances in which he or she observed mr. leon in
possession of or dealing in drugs. simply put, with respect to the items sought
and the places to be searched authorized by the warrants, there is nothing
compelling about the information from the ci which formed the basis for the
issuance of the warrants. nor is there anything in the ito to allow the issuing
justice to know the precise source of the ci’s information.
while
the ci may have provided more detailed, and therefore potentially more
compelling information about possession of firearms, that does little to
advance the proposition that mr. leon was also in possession of drugs. while i
accept that guns and drugs are “frequent companions,”
that there
may be grounds to believe that someone is in possession of one cannot be a
substitute for the complete absence of grounds that they possess the other.
in
any event, i am skeptical that the ito discloses reasonable grounds to believe
that mr. leon was in possession of firearms. as the affiant himself stated,
“the information related to the firearm(s) is also dated and i am unable to corroborate
that part of the information any further at this point of the investigation.”
this
reference to firearms led to a curious turn in the course of the crown’s
submissions.
initially,
the crown conceded that on a facial analysis the ito did not provide reasonable
grounds to believe that drugs or any related items listed in appendix “a” of
the ito would be found at any of the places to be searched.
he
maintained however, that if the issuing justice was satisfied that the ito
failed
to disclose reasonable grounds to believe that any of the items in appendix “a”
would be found at any of the locations to be searched, but
did
disclose
reasonable grounds to believe that
firearms
would be found, even though
they are not listed in appendix “a”, these
cdsa
warrants could issue authorizing
the police to seize
firearms
. the crown explained that this was the case
because the affiant was full, fair and frank in disclosing to the issuing
justice that the true goal of the investigation was to search for firearms, not
drugs. in other words, the
cdsa
warrant could be used as a subterfuge for
the seizure of guns if that was necessary in order to protect the identity of a
confidential source.
this
is a novel submission, in support of which the crown relied on the judgment of kenkel
j.
in
r. v. dadollahi-sarab
.
that
case provides no assistance to the crown. there, the defence complained that
the police obtained a
cdsa
warrant as a ruse to enable them to install a
listening device in the accused’s home in furtherance of a different investigation.
that device had been judicially authorized in a separate application, but the
police had been unable to gain surreptitious access to the accused’s residence
to install it. the affiant had disclosed to the issuing justice on the
cdsa
application that installing the device was the primary purpose of seeking the
warrant.
kenkel
j.
found on the
garofoli
review that the
cdsa
warrant was
properly issued because there were reasonable grounds to believe that the items
to be seized under that warrant would be found in the residence.
with
respect to the so-called ruse, he said this, at para. 25:
the presence of a “dual
purpose” at the time the affiant applied for the warrant did not invalidate the
resort to
s.11
of the
cdsa
--
r v sandhu
2011 onca 124
. this
applies even where the other purpose is the more important purpose in the eyes
of the officer --
sandhu
at para. 62. i find the circumstances including
the reference to the second purpose set out in the june 23rd ito did not
disclose a s.8 breach such that the authorizing justice of the peace should
have declined to issue the warrant.
i
know of no lawful basis to conclude that a
cdsa
warrant could issue in
the circumstances described by the crown. it runs contrary to a basic premise
of search warrant principles and jurisprudence to suggest that a
cdsa
warrant
could issue, even if the ito fails to disclose reasonable grounds to believe
that the items sought under the warrant are in the places to be searched.
it
may be that a
criminal code
s. 487.01 general warrant could be sought to
authorize such a ruse;
a
cdsa
warrant could not be.
with
respect to the third
debot
factor,
credibility, the excised ito sheds
very little light on the ci’s history.
[iii]
it addresses, as the judicial summary discloses, the ci’s background and role
in criminal activity
and
the length of time the ci has been involved with it, and provides a general
assertion as to the degree of the ci’s involvement in this criminal subculture.
it also discloses in the most general of terms the ci’s motivation for
providing information.
[iv]
the ito, particularly in light of the redacted reference to the ci’s history as
an informant, has little to offer in terms of measuring the ci’s credibility.
as
wilson j. said
in
debot
, “the level of verification required may be
higher where the police rely on an informant whose credibility cannot be
assessed or where fewer details are provided and the risk of innocent
coincidence is greater.”
since in this case the credibility of the informant cannot be assessed and few
details were supplied, a relatively higher level of corroboration was required.
here,
as i have discussed, the level of meaningful corroboration was low.
the
affiant provides his belief as to whether or not the information received from
the ci is firsthand, second-hand, based on gossip, observations, or a
combination of these. but that assertion is not supported by any examples of
firsthand knowledge or observations by the ci. like much of the ito, this
amounts to little more than the affiant’s submission or belief,
unsupported by any
evidence
,
about the source of the information supplied by the ci. the mere assertion by
the affiant that the information is firsthand, is detailed or that the ci is
credible cannot serve to enhance the ci’s credibility. it is the affiant’s
opinion; it is not evidence.
in
sum, this ito falls on all three branches of the
debot
framework.
stripped
to its bare essentials, it is little more than a generalized, unsourced
assertion that some general item of contraband will be found in property
related to mr. leon. in my respectful view, the information in this application
did not cross the threshold into credibly-based probability and failed to establish
reasonable grounds to believe that the items sought would be found in any of
the three locations authorized to be searched.
mr.
leon has demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that the search of his
residences, vehicle and his person was a violation of s. 8.
i
will now turn to s. 24(2).
6.         section 24(2)
mr.
leon bears the onus of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the
admission of the impugned evidence would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.
as
the supreme court of canada set out
in
r. v. grant
,
the focus of
the s. 24(2) analysis is on the overall repute of the administration of justice
and the public’s confidence in the justice system in view of the long-term
consequences of admission of unlawfully obtained evidence.
the
focus of this application was, of course, on the issuance of the search
warrants. but the analysis with respect to breach of s. 8 applies equally to
the search incident to arrest of mr. leon. that arrest was premised on the same
grounds to believe he was in possession of illegal firearms as those contained
in the ito.
the
grant
analysis
is comprised of three lines of inquiry. the first line of
inquiry addresses the seriousness of the
charter
-infringing state
conduct. as
grant
holds, there is a spectrum of seriousness:
at one end of the
spectrum, admission of evidence obtained through inadvertent or minor
violations of the
charter
may minimally undermine public confidence in
the rule of law. at the other end of the spectrum, admitting evidence obtained
through a wilful or reckless disregard of
charter
rights will inevitably
have a negative effect on the public confidence in the rule of law, and risk
bringing the administration of justice into disrepute.
here,
the seriousness of the breach lies in what was at the very least a careless
approach to the drafting of this ito. the crown conceded that the ito was
largely a “boilerplate” affidavit in respect of which the affiant did little to
tailor the application to the circumstances of this case.
in
my view the affiant’s repeated assertions about the credibility of the ci, the
corroboration of information and the compelling nature of the information
supplied were not just careless, they were a subtle attempt to convince the
issuing justice, successfully as it turned out, that this application was far
stronger that the evidence actually made out.
the
crown’s submission that this application was made as a ruse to seize firearms
suggests that this was an approach deliberately adopted by the affiant. that is
highly concerning, displaying as it does what in my view is the most elementary
of misunderstandings of the warrant process.
it
is also troubling that, while the affiant discloses the reason why he is not
seeking a
criminal code
search warrant, he does not make it clear to the
issuing justice that he was really seeking to seize firearms under the guise of
a paper-thin application for a
cdsa
warrant. i have little doubt that
the issuing justice had no idea this was the affiant’s intent.
indeed,
in my view the effect of the disclaimer paragraph was to mislead the issuing
justice. if this was not intentional, it at the very least displayed a reckless
disregard for the affiant’s obligations in bringing this
ex parte
application
and deprived the issuing justice of information essential for him to properly
exercise his discretion to issue the warrants.
the
comments of rosenberg ja
in
r. v. hosie
are particularly apposite here.
there, the affiant had included a misleading paragraph respecting the
informant’s reliability. in holding that the evidence seized under the warrant
should be excluded, rosenberg ja commented:
the wording of
that paragraph displays a degree of carelessness completely inconsistent with
the standard of care expected from any police officer deemed competent to apply
for a search warrant.  that wording had the effect of misleading the justice of
the peace, who was required to pass upon the sufficiency of the information….the
obtaining of a search warrant in this fashion strikes at the core of the
administration of justice.  as dickson j. observed in
hunter et al v. southam
inc
., supra at page 110, for a procedure of prior authorization to be
meaningful “it is necessary for the person authorizing the search to be able to
assess the evidence as to whether that standard has been met, in an entirely
neutral and impartial manner”.  the justice can only perform that function if
provided with accurate and candid information.  blind reliance upon ritualistic
phrases without regard to the facts of the particular case robs the judicial
officer of the ability to perform this vital function in the administration of
justice….the courts should not be seen as condoning the use of language in
search warrants which masks the true state of affairs and deprives a judicial
officer of the opportunity to fairly assess whether the state's interest in
detecting crime outweighs the individual's privacy interest in his or her  own
home.
i
am cognizant of rosenberg ja’s caution
in
rocha
that “[a]pplying for and
obtaining a search warrant from an independent judicial officer is the
antithesis of wilful disregard of
charter
rights.”
but as
rosenberg ja went on to say:
i should not be
taken as holding that whenever a search warrant has been granted, the first
grant
inquiry favours admission of the evidence. but the approach is not, as held by
the trial judge, to hold in favour of exclusion because obtaining a search
warrant is a deliberate process. the approach rather should be to look at the
ito and consider first if it is misleading in any way. if so, the court should
then consider where it lies on the continuum from the intentional use of false
and misleading information at one end to mere inadvertence at the other end.
in
my view the affiant was not reasonably diligent in ensuring that he conveyed
the true state of affairs to the issuing justice. he tried to bootstrap a weak
application with inappropriate submissions and groundless assertions. as fish j.
put it
in
r. v. morelli
:
the repute of the
administration of justice is jeopardized by judicial indifference to
unacceptable police conduct. police officers seeking search warrants are bound
to act with diligence and integrity, taking care to discharge the special
duties of candour and full disclosure that attach in
ex parte
proceedings. in discharging those duties responsibly, they must guard against
making statements that are likely to mislead the justice of the peace. they
must refrain from concealing or omitting relevant facts. and they must take
care not to otherwise exaggerate the information upon which they rely to
establish reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of a search warrant.
while
i cannot find that the affiant deliberately set out to mislead the issuing
justice, the application left a great deal to be desired and demonstrated an
unfortunate disregard for basic principles governing applications for judicial authorizations.
the
extent to which the ito fell short of providing reasonable grounds suggests a
concerning ignorance of
charter
standards by the police who sought the
warrant. this contributes to the seriousness of the breach.
in
my view the first branch of the
grant
analysis
pulls strongly in favour
of exclusion of the evidence.
the
second line of inquiry assesses the impact of the violation on the accused’s
charter-
protected
interests. this line of inquiry requires an assessment of the nature of the
charter-
protected
interests engaged and the degree to which the
charter
violation impacts
those interests.
in
my view the impact on mr. leon was considerable. the police searched the most
protected of private areas – his residence, his person and, to a lesser extent,
his vehicle. the search of his person occurred in a public place.
the
second
grant
factor
also pulls strongly in favour of the exclusion of
the evidence.
the
third line of inquiry assesses the societal interest in an adjudication on the
merits. does the vindication of a
charter
violation exact too
great a toll on the truth-seeking function of the trial process?
there
is no question that society has a very strong interest in an adjudication of
this case on the merits, as it involves the alleged possession of loaded
illegal firearms, one of them allegedly on mr. leon’s person as he walked
around a busy area of the city. it is also beyond dispute that the public in
the city of toronto, and in canada generally, is justifiably alarmed at the
proliferation of illegal firearms, and the risk to public safety which they
pose.
it
may be that the firearm seized from mr. leon incident to arrest is measured
slightly differently in the 24(2) analysis than those that were hidden from
view in the trunk of his car. either way, this is real, reliable evidence which
is essential to the crown’s case. multiple firearms are involved. the third
branch pulls strongly in favour of admission.
in
balancing the lines of inquiry, it is the cumulative weight of the first two
lines of inquiry that must be balanced against the third line of inquiry.
where
the first two lines of inquiry tip strongly towards exclusion, the third line
of inquiry will rarely tip the scale back to admissibility.
excluding
reliable firearms evidence at any time is not something that should be done
lightly. in the current climate the public rightly expects those who possess
illegal firearms to be properly tried and, if found guilty, appropriately
sanctioned. at the same time, as mclachlin cj and justice charron, writing for
the majority, observed
in
grant
:
the phrase “bring
the administration of justice into disrepute” must be understood in the
long-term sense of maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the
justice system.  exclusion of evidence resulting in an acquittal may provoke
immediate criticism.  but s. 24(2) does not focus on immediate reaction to the
individual case.  rather, it looks to whether the overall repute of the justice
system, viewed in the long term, will be adversely affected by admission of the
evidence.  the inquiry is objective.  it asks whether a reasonable person,
informed of all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the
charter
,
would conclude that the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.
while
undoubtedly the public has a very strong interest in the adjudication of this
case on the merits, i accept that the long-term reputation of the
administration of justice requires that the evidence of the firearms and
associated items seized from mr. leon and from his car be excluded as their
admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
7.         conclusion
mr.
leon’s application to exclude the evidence seized from him incident to arrest
and from his vehicle is allowed. his s. 8 rights were violated by the issuance
of search warrants in the absence of the statutory prerequisites necessary to authorize
those searches, and the police did not have reasonable grounds to believe he
was in possession of firearms at the time he was arrested.
the
evidence of the firearms is excluded from this trial.

. strictly speaking, the burden here is divided because mr. leon bears
the burden with respect to the offences relating to firearms seized from his
vehicle during the execution of a
cdsa
warrant, while the crown bears
the burden with respect to charges relating to firearms seized from mr. leon’s
person incident to his warrantless arrest. as my analysis will show, the
location of the burden is ultimately immaterial to the result in this case.

the crown later in his submissions
withdrew that concession and maintained that the ito
did
provide
reasonable grounds to support the issuance of the warrants to search for and
seize drugs and associated items listed in appendix “a”.

, where a general warrant was
issued authorizing police to stop and search the suspects and their vehicle
using a false pretext, based on reasonable grounds to believe a drug
trafficking offence had been committed. by not revealing the true reason for
the stop and search, the police were able to continue their investigation
without disclosing its existence to the other targeted individuals. the québec
court of appeal held that the general warrant could not issue because it
implicitly
authorized
the police to detain the target while concealing the true reason for that
detention, in violation of the s. 10(a) of the
charter
