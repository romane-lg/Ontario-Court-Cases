d. f.
mcleod, j.:
i.          introduction
this judgment arises from an application
challenging the validity of a search warrant executed at the residence of the
accused, mr. kevin arruda. the application alleges that the warrant was
obtained in breach of
section 8
of the
canadian charter of rights and freedoms
,
due to material omissions and misstatements in the information to obtain (ito)
submitted by the affiant. the court is tasked with determining whether the
warrant was lawfully issued, whether the affiant fulfilled the duty of full,
fair, and frank disclosure, and whether any resulting breach of the charter
warrants the exclusion of evidence under section 24(2). the analysis that
follows is grounded in the evidentiary record, the applicable legal principles,
and the submissions of both parties.
ii.
relevant facts
in support of an application for a search warrant under
section 487
of
the
criminal code
, the affiant relied on a series of facts suggesting a
connection between the applicant, kevin arruda, and a pattern of harassing
conduct involving both physical and electronic communications. the
investigation began after letters signed “pedro” were left at the residence of ts’s
family. these letters were temporally associated with messages sent from social
media accounts—bearing names similar to “peter smith”—that were linked to the
applicant. the messages, which were directed at ts, were described as unwanted
and fraudulent, and the letters contained references to ts, her parents, and
threats of future sexual violence involving ts and ms.
additional information was provided by a neighbor, pa., who reported
receiving an email from “
peterpedro@
[...]
”
stating “i know where you live.” this communication was viewed as potentially
connecting the alias “pedro” used in the letters with the name “peter” used in
the electronic messages. pa. also received emails from individuals purporting
to be ts’s father and ms, referencing the earlier messages and asking about
communications from “pedro peter.”
statements were obtained from ts, ms, and ds. none of the individuals
were able to definitively identify the person responsible for the
communications. while several individuals were considered persons of interest,
the investigation did not yield evidence implicating them, with the exception
of the applicant.
following the issuance of the warrant, police conducted a search of the
applicant’s residence. during the search, they located a loaded restricted
firearm under a blanket on a bed. additional items found included four
prohibited devices (two shortened barrels and two over-capacity magazines),
multiple firearm components (including 12 barrels and 20 slides), an
unserialized firearm receiver frame that could be assembled into a functional
handgun, and a modified bag containing two large knives, multiple zip ties, and
an interior holster.
iii.
position
of parties
applicant’s position
counsel for the applicant, ms. savena bhangal, argues that the search
warrant issued under
section 487
of the
criminal code
was obtained in violation
of
section 8
of the
charter
. she submits that the information to obtain (ito)
was materially misleading due to deliberate omissions, misstatements, and
unsupported assertions by the affiant, detective constable mchenry.
ms. bhangal contends that the affiant failed to disclose alternative
suspects, omitted exculpatory facts such as negative surveillance results, and
mischaracterized witness statements. these actions, she argues, misled the
issuing justice and subverted the integrity of the warrant process.
ex parte
she further asserts that even if the ito, once corrected through
excision and amplification, could support the issuance of the warrant, the
process was so tainted by bad faith that the warrant must be quashed. upholding
it, she argues, would undermine the foundational principle that judicial
authorizations must be obtained through full, fair, and frank disclosure.
under section 24(2) of the
charter
, ms. bhangal submits that the
evidence obtained from the search should be excluded. the breach was serious,
the intrusion into the home was significant, and the long-term integrity of the
justice system outweighs the short-term interest in prosecuting the offence.
respondent’s position
counsel
for the crown, ms. amita persad-ford, maintains that the warrant was lawfully issued,
and that the ito provided sufficient grounds for the issuing justice to find
reasonable and probable grounds. while acknowledging that some errors were
made, she characterizes them as minor, technical, and made in good faith.
ms.
persad-ford emphasizes that the affiant was credible and cooperative during
cross-examination and that there is no evidence of deliberate misconduct. she
argues that the core facts linking the applicant to the online harassment and
threatening letters remain intact, even after excision.
in
her section 24(2) analysis, ms. persad-ford highlights the seriousness of the
offences—possession of a loaded restricted firearm and controlled
substances—and society’s strong interest in prosecuting such crimes. she
contends that the evidence is reliable, probative, and essential to the crown’s
case.
she
submits that the police acted appropriately by seeking judicial authorization
and that any breach, if found, does not warrant exclusion. ms. persad-ford
urges the court to admit the evidence and allow the matter to proceed on its
merits, emphasizing the need to balance individual rights with the public
interest in effective law enforcement.
iii.
relevant evidence
detective
constable luke mchenry was the affiant who prepared the information to obtain
(ito) that supported the issuance of a search warrant executed on mr. kevin
arruda’s residence. during the garofoli
voir dire
, mchenry testified
that the ito contained certain factual inaccuracies. these included a statement
that the threatening letters were addressed to ts, when they were addressed to
her parents, and a reference to the alias “peter smith” instead of “peter.”
mchenry stated that these inaccuracies were the result of oversight and
reliance on information from police occurrence reports.
mchenry
also testified that the ito did not include certain facts known to police at
the time of the application. these included the results of surveillance footage
from the s residence and surrounding area, which did not show mr. arruda or his
vehicle, and the fact that ip addresses associated with suspicious email
accounts were traced to kitchener and australia. mchenry also confirmed that
the ito did not mention that police were awaiting results from a bell canada
production order related to the impersonation email accounts.
in
his testimony, mchenry stated that he believed the ito provided a fair summary
of the relevant facts. when asked about the omissions, he indicated that they
were not included because they were not considered material at the time. he did
not provide further detail on the decision-making process regarding the
selection of facts included in the ito.
the
testimony addressed the process by which the ito was prepared and the
information that was relied upon. the evidence included both the content of the
ito and the affiant’s explanations for the inclusion and exclusion of specific
facts. the court heard that the ito emphasized certain elements of the
investigation and did not include others that were known to police at the time.
a.
duty to provide full, fair, and frank disclosure
legal framework and case law
an officer applying for a search warrant has a legal duty to
provide full, fair, and frank disclosure of all material facts. this principle
is firmly established in canadian jurisprudence. in r. v. araujo,
2000 scc 65
at para
46
, the supreme court of canada held that an affiant must present all
material facts, including those that may be unfavourable to the crown’s
position. this duty is heightened in
ex parte
proceedings, where the
subject of the warrant has no opportunity to respond. similarly, in r. v.
morelli,
2010 scc 8
at paras
50–55
, the court emphasized that omissions or
misleading statements in an information to obtain (ito) (ito) can distort the
evidentiary matrix and affect the range of inferences available to the issuing
justice.
the duty is not limited to avoiding falsehoods;
it extends to ensuring that the ito does not omit material facts that could
impact the issuing justice’s assessment of whether the statutory preconditions
for a warrant have been met. as noted in r. v. nyadu,
2024 onsc 4092
at para
2
,
deliberate or reckless omissions that subvert the integrity of the
pre-authorization process may justify setting aside the warrant and excluding the
evidence obtained.
evidence from the officer and
supporting materials
detective constable mchenry testified that he
relied on police occurrence reports and statements from ts in preparing the
ito. he acknowledged that the ito incorrectly stated that the threatening
letters were addressed to ts, and that it referred to the alias “peter smith”
instead of “peter.” he also confirmed that the ito did not include the results
of surveillance, or the geographic origin of the ip addresses linked to the
email accounts. mchenry stated that these omissions were not intentional and
that he believed the ito fairly summarized the relevant facts.
the defence’s factum further points to internal
police memos and production order results that were available to the affiant at
the time but not disclosed in the ito. these documents, according to the
defence, would have provided important context and may have led the issuing
justice to a different conclusion regarding the existence of reasonable and
probable grounds.
counsel submissions
in the present case, both the crown and defence
acknowledge the existence of this duty, though they differ in its application.
the defence submits that the affiant, detective constable luke mchenry, failed
to meet this obligation by omitting several material facts from the ito. these
include the absence of surveillance evidence linking mr. arruda to the scene,
the lack of connection between mr. arruda and the ip addresses associated with
the impersonation emails, and the pending results of a bell canada production
order. the defence argues that these omissions were significant and deprived
the issuing justice of the ability to properly assess the reliability of the
affiant’s belief.
the crown, in contrast, maintains that mchenry
acted in good faith and that any errors or omissions were minor and technical.
it argues that the affiant provided explanations for the inaccuracies during
cross-examination and that the ito, when read as a whole, presented a
reasonable basis for the issuance of the warrant. the crown emphasizes that the
affiant’s conduct did not amount to bad faith and that the core investigative
theory remained supported by the evidence available at the time.
conclusion
while the legal standard for full, fair, and
frank disclosure is clear and undisputed, its application in this case raises
concerns. the omissions identified—particularly the absence of surveillance
evidence, the lack of connection to the ip addresses, and the pending
production order—were not peripheral. they were directly relevant to the
reliability of the affiant’s belief and the strength of the investigative
theory. although the affiant may not have acted with deliberate intent to
mislead, the cumulative effect of the omissions materially impacted the
completeness of the ito.
in light of the case law and the factual record,
it is difficult to conclude that the duty of full, fair, and frank disclosure
was fully satisfied. the omissions, whether due to oversight or investigative
tunnel vision, undermined the integrity of the pre-authorization process and
compromised the issuing justice’s ability to make an informed decision.
accordingly, the warrant’s validity must be carefully scrutinized in light of
these deficiencies.
b.
did the officer act in good faith?
legal framework and case law
the concept of good faith in the context of
search warrant applications is closely tied to the affiant’s duty to provide
full, fair, and frank disclosure. while courts recognize that affiants may make
errors, the distinction between honest mistakes and conduct that undermines the
integrity of the warrant process is critical. in r. v. araujo,
2000 scc 65
at
para
46
, the supreme court emphasized that affiants must not omit material
facts or mislead the issuing justice. in r. v. morelli,
2010 scc 8
at para
49
,
the court held that false statements or omissions in an ito may contravene this
duty, even if not made with deliberate intent. however, where deliberate
deception is found, as in r. v. nyadu,
2024 onsc 4092
at para
118
, the court
may conclude that the affiant did not act in good faith, and the warrant may be
set aside
.
evidence from the officer and
supporting materials
detective constable mchenry testified that he
relied on police occurrence reports and witness statements in preparing the
ito. he acknowledged that the ito incorrectly stated that the threatening
letters were addressed to ts and that it referred to the alias “peter smith”
instead of “peter.” he also confirmed that the ito did not include the results
of surveillance or the geographic origin of the ip addresses linked to the
email accounts. mchenry stated that these omissions were not intentional and
that he believed the ito fairly summarized the relevant facts. no internal
police memos or notes were produced to show how the affiant evaluated the
materiality of the omitted information.
submissions from counsel
the defence submits that the affiant, detective
constable luke mchenry, failed to act in good faith by omitting material facts
from the ito and presenting a narrative that overstated the strength of the
evidence linking mr. arruda to the alleged offences. these omissions included
the lack of surveillance evidence, the absence of any known connection between
mr. arruda and the ip addresses associated with the impersonation emails, and
the pending results of a bell canada production order. the defence argues that
these omissions were not minor and that their cumulative effect distorted the
evidentiary matrix presented to the issuing justice.
the crown, by contrast, maintains that mchenry
acted in good faith throughout the warrant application process. it submits that
the affiant acknowledged and explained the errors in the ito during
cross-examination and that there is no evidence of deliberate intent to
mislead. the crown emphasizes that the affiant relied on information available
at the time, including statements from ts and production order results, and
that the ito reflected a reasonable interpretation of the evidence. the crown
further argues that the affiant’s conduct does not rise to the level of bad
faith as contemplated in cases such as nyadu or maton.
conclusion
while there is no direct evidence that detective
constable mchenry acted with deliberate intent to mislead, the omissions
identified in the ito raise concerns about the thoroughness and objectivity of
the warrant application. the affiant’s failure to include known facts that were
directly relevant to the reliability of the investigative theory suggests a
lack of diligence in meeting the standard of full, fair, and frank disclosure.
although the crown characterizes the errors as minor, their cumulative effect
was to present a narrative that may have overstated the strength of the case
against mr. arruda.
in the absence of clear evidence of intentional deception, it may
be concluded that the affiant did not act in bad faith in the strictest legal
sense. however, the record supports a finding that the affiant did not fully
discharge his duty to act with the care and candor required in an
ex parte
proceeding. the omissions, whether the result of tunnel vision or investigative
bias, undermined the completeness of the ito and compromised the issuing
justice’s ability to assess the existence of reasonable and probable grounds.
as such, the affiant’s conduct falls short of the standard expected in the
preparation of a judicial authorization.
c.
have there been any material omissions?
counsel submissions
in the present case, the defence has identified
several omissions in the ito that it characterizes as material. these include
the failure to disclose that surveillance footage from the s.’s residence and
surrounding area did not show mr. arruda or his vehicle. the ito also did not
mention that ip addresses associated with the impersonation email accounts
traced to kitchener and australia—locations with which mr. arruda had no known
connection. additionally, the ito did not disclose that police were awaiting
the results of a bell canada production order that could have provided
subscriber information for the ip addresses in question.
another omission raised by the defence concerns
the attribution of online accounts. while two accounts were linked to mr. arruda
through production order results, the ito referenced several others without
distinguishing which were supported by evidence and which were not. the defence
submits that this presentation may have led the issuing justice to infer a
broader connection than the evidence warranted. furthermore, the ito did not
include information from witness statements suggesting that other individuals
may have had access to the personal details referenced in the letters,
including a former personal support worker who had previously interacted with
the s family.
the crown, in response, acknowledges that
certain facts were not included in the ito but maintains that these omissions
were not material. it argues that the affiant, detective constable mchenry,
acted in good faith and that the ito, when read as a whole, provided a
sufficient basis for the issuance of the warrant. the crown emphasizes that the
affiant relied on information available at the time, including statements from ts
and production order results, and that the omissions did not significantly
alter the overall reliability of the investigative theory.
legal framework
the legal standard for assessing material omissions in an ito is
well established. as stated in r. v. morelli,
2010 scc 8
at paras
50–55
,
omissions that affect the range of inferences available to the issuing justice
may undermine the validity of a warrant. the affiant is required to present all
material facts known at the time of the application, including those that may
weaken the investigative theory. this principle is reinforced in r. v. araujo,
2000 scc 65
at para
46
, and r. v. nyadu,
2024 onsc 4092
at para
2
, which
emphasize the importance of full, fair, and frank disclosure in
ex parte
proceedings.
conclusion
while the crown characterizes the omissions as
minor, the nature and number of the excluded facts suggest that they were
directly relevant to the reliability of the affiant’s belief and the strength
of the investigative theory. the absence of surveillance evidence, the lack of
connection to the ip addresses, and the pending production order results were
all facts known to police at the time of the application. their omission
limited the issuing justice’s ability to fully assess whether the statutory
preconditions for the warrant were met.
taken individually, each omission may be viewed
as a matter of judgment. however, when considered cumulatively, they present a
pattern of selective disclosure that may have affected the issuing justice’s
assessment of the evidence. these omissions were not peripheral; they related
to the core question of whether there were reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that evidence of an offence would be found at mr. arruda’s residence.
as such, they are properly characterized as material and warrant close scrutiny
in the context of the
charter
challenge.
d.
analysis of online attribution of accounts
counsel submissions
the attribution of various online accounts to mr. arruda was a
central component of the investigative theory presented in the information to
obtain (ito). the ito referenced multiple email and social media accounts,
including those used to send threatening messages and impersonate individuals
connected to the complainants. according to the crown’s submissions, two of
these accounts were linked to mr. arruda through production order results that
identified subscriber information or ip address usage consistent with his known
identifiers. the crown argues that this evidence, combined with contextual
factors such as the use of the alias “peter” and the timing of the messages,
provided a reasonable basis to believe that mr. arruda was responsible for the
online activity.
the defence, however, challenges the sufficiency
and clarity of the attribution. it submits that the ito failed to distinguish
between accounts that were supported by production order evidence and those
that were not. the defence argues that the ito presented the accounts
collectively, creating the impression that all were linked to mr. arruda when,
in fact, only two had any evidentiary connection. the remaining accounts,
according to the defence, were included without disclosing that no subscriber
information or ip data tied them to the applicant. this, the defence contends,
amounted to a material omission that may have misled the issuing justice
regarding the strength of the digital evidence.
further, the defence points to the absence of
information in the ito regarding the geographic origin of the ip addresses
associated with the unlinked accounts. some of these addresses were traced to
locations such as kitchener and australia, with which mr. arruda had no known
connection. the defence submits that this information, known to police at the
time, should have been disclosed to allow the issuing justice to assess whether
the accounts could reasonably be attributed to the applicant. the defence also
notes that the ito did not clarify whether the police had ruled out other
potential users or whether the accounts had been accessed from devices or
networks associated with mr. arruda.
the crown maintains that the affiant acted in
good faith and that the ito, when read as a whole, provided a fair summary of
the evidence. it argues that the inclusion of multiple accounts was necessary
to illustrate the pattern of conduct under investigation and that the affiant’s
belief in mr. arruda’s involvement was based on a cumulative assessment of the
digital and circumstantial evidence. the crown further submits that any lack of
specificity in the attribution did not materially affect the sufficiency of the
grounds for the warrant.
legal framework/conclusion
when considered in light of the legal standard requiring full,
fair, and frank disclosure, the manner in which the online accounts were
presented in the information to obtain (ito) raises concerns about the adequacy
of the attribution. while the inclusion of multiple accounts may have been
intended to illustrate a broader pattern of conduct, the ito did not clearly
differentiate between accounts that were supported by production order evidence
and those that were not. this lack of specificity may have led the issuing
justice to infer that all referenced accounts were linked to mr. arruda, when
in fact only two had any evidentiary connection. the defence submits that this
presentation created a misleading impression of the strength of the digital
evidence, particularly in the absence of clarifying language or evidentiary
breakdowns.
additionally, the ito did not disclose that some
of the ip addresses associated with the unlinked accounts were traced to
geographic locations such as kitchener and australia—places with no known
connection to mr. arruda. nor did it clarify whether police had ruled out other
potential users or whether the accounts had been accessed from devices
or networks associated with the applicant. these omissions, while not
necessarily deliberate, limited the issuing justice’s ability to assess the
reliability of the affiant’s belief. although there is no direct evidence of
bad faith, the cumulative effect of these omissions and ambiguities undermines
the transparency of the ito. as a result, the attribution of the online
accounts, as presented, may not have met the standard of disclosure required in
an
ex parte
warrant application.
d.  where
their strategic omissions
legal framework
the jurisprudence establishes that affiants must provide full,
fair, and frank disclosure in
ex parte
warrant applications. strategic
omissions—particularly those that obscure weaknesses in the investigative
theory or conceal exculpatory information—can invalidate a warrant, even if the
remaining content could support its issuance.
the key legal takeaways are:
(i)
materiality matters: omissions must be assessed
for their impact on the issuing justice’s ability to evaluate reasonable
grounds.
(ii)
good faith is not a shield: even if omissions
are not overtly malicious, a pattern of selective disclosure may still amount
to subversion.
(iii)
the process must be protected: courts have a
residual discretion to quash a warrant where the integrity of the authorization
process is compromised, as affirmed in paryniuk and maton.
(iv)
the standard is not perfection, but candor: as
araujo and george make clear, affiants are not expected to be flawless, but
they must be honest and balanced.
ultimately, the court must determine whether the
omissions in this case were so significant and deliberate that they undermined
the fairness and reliability of the warrant process. if so, exclusion of the
evidence may be required to preserve the integrity of the justice system.
counsel submissions
ms. bhangal submits that the affiant, detective
constable mchenry, engaged in strategic omissions that materially misled the
issuing justice. she argues that the affiant failed to disclose key exculpatory
facts, including the absence of any direct evidence linking mr. arruda to the
threatening letters, the lack of surveillance or eyewitness evidence, and the
existence of alternative suspects. these omissions, she contends, distorted the
evidentiary matrix and undermined the issuing justice’s ability to assess the
existence of reasonable and probable grounds.
in support of her position, ms. bhangal relies
on the supreme court’s decision in r v morelli,
2010 scc 8
, where the court
emphasized that affiants must not “pick and choose” among facts and must avoid
incomplete recitations that invite misleading inferences (para 58). she also
cites r v maton, 2005 bcsc, where a warrant was quashed due to the affiant’s
failure to disclose that the residence had no basement, contradicting a key
claim in the ito. additionally, she references r v nyadu,
2024 onsc 4092
, where
the court found that deliberate omissions and misstatements by experienced
officers subverted the warrant process and justified exclusion of the evidence.
ms. bhangal argues that even if the ito could
support the warrant after excision, the deliberate nature of the omissions
requires the court to quash the warrant to protect the integrity of the prior
authorization process.
ms. persad-ford, for the crown, maintains that
while there were omissions in the ito, they were not material and did not
mislead the issuing justice. she argues that the affiant’s conduct did not rise
to the level of bad faith or deliberate deception. the omissions, in her view,
were the result of reasonable judgment calls about what was relevant, and the
ito, when read as a whole, provided sufficient grounds for the warrant.
she relies on r v araujo,
2000 scc 65
, where the
court acknowledged that itos are not expected to be perfect and that minor
errors or omissions do not automatically invalidate a warrant. ms. persad-ford
also cites r v george,
2003 oj no 4825 (scj)
, where the court cautioned against
dissecting itos with 20/20 hindsight and emphasized the need for a practical,
common-sense approach. she further references r v paryniuk,
2017 onca 87
, to
argue that the residual discretion to quash a warrant should only be exercised
in cases of clear subversion of the process, which she submits is not present
here.
ms. persad-ford contends that the affiant acted
in good faith, and that the omissions did not affect the core facts supporting
the warrant. therefore, the warrant should be upheld and the evidence admitted.
conclusion
the
judicial authorization process is a cornerstone of the constitutional
protection against unreasonable search and seizure. it is designed to ensure
that intrusions into privacy—particularly into the sanctity of one’s home—are
justified by objective, credible, and complete information. the issuing justice
must be equipped with all material facts, both inculpatory and exculpatory, in
order to make a fully informed and impartial decision. anything less undermines
the very purpose of the
ex parte
process, which relies entirely on the
affiant’s duty of candor.
in
this case, the court was not presented with a balanced and transparent account.
the omissions and misstatements in the information to obtain (ito) deprived the
issuing justice of the ability to properly assess the reliability and
sufficiency of the grounds. this failure is not merely procedural—it strikes at
the heart of the
charter
’s protection and the legitimacy of the warrant process
itself.
the
integrity of the pre-authorization process is of paramount importance. it is
not enough that a warrant could have issued; it must be shown that it did issue
through a process that was fair, honest, and faithful to the law. where that
process is compromised, the court must act to preserve public confidence in the
administration of justice. upholding the warrant in such circumstances would
send the wrong message—that shortcuts and selective disclosure are tolerable in
pursuit of investigative goals.
accordingly,
the court must reaffirm that the rule of law demands more. the justice system
must not only be effective but also principled. protecting the integrity of the
warrant process ensures that the rights of all individuals are respected—not
just in this case, but in every case that follows.
iii.
24(2) analysis
the
applicant respectfully submits that although the offences in question—namely,
possession of a loaded restricted firearm and a controlled substance—are
serious under the
criminal code
and engage strong societal interests in
prosecution, these interests must be weighed against the foundational
principles that govern the issuance of search warrants. the integrity of the
pre-authorization process is paramount. the evidence in this case was obtained
through a warrant issued under
section 487
of the criminal code, but the
process by which that warrant was obtained was fundamentally flawed.
the
affiant, detective constable mchenry, engaged in a pattern of conduct that
included deliberate omissions, misleading statements, and bald assertions
unsupported by evidence. these actions were not mere technical errors or
oversights; they were strategic and calculated, designed to mislead the issuing
justice and secure a warrant on the basis of a distorted evidentiary record.
the affiant failed to disclose material facts, including the absence of any
connection between the applicant and key digital evidence, the lack of
surveillance or eyewitness evidence, and the existence of alternative suspects.
this conduct subverted the
ex parte
nature of the warrant process, which
relies on the affiant’s duty to be full, fair, and frank.
under
the framework established in r v grant, the seriousness of the
charter-infringing conduct weighs heavily in favour of exclusion. the affiant’s
actions reflect a disregard for the constitutional safeguards that protect
against unreasonable search and seizure. the second grant factor—the impact on
the accused’s charter-protected interests—is also significant. the search
intruded upon the applicant’s home, a space that attracts the highest
expectation of privacy. the third factor, society’s interest in adjudication on
the merits, must be considered in light of the long-term repute of the justice
system. while the offences are serious, the justice system cannot be seen to
condone unlawful conduct by admitting evidence obtained through a corrupted
process.
conclusion
even
if, after excision of the misleading and erroneous information, the remaining
content of the ito could support the issuance of the warrant, the warrant
should still be quashed. courts have recognized a residual discretion to
invalidate a warrant where the conduct of the police subverts the prior
authorization process. upholding the warrant in this case would send a message
that the ends justify the means, undermining public confidence in the fairness
and integrity of the judicial process. the charter is designed to prevent
unreasonable intrusions before they occur, not to retroactively justify them.
accordingly,
the applicant submits that the evidence obtained through the search should be
excluded pursuant to
section 24(2)
of the
charter
. the long-term integrity of
the justice system demands no less.
