part i – an overview of
the pre-trial applications
this ruling is on the admissibility of:
(i)
the custodial video-recorded interview
of mr.
laguerre taken at 12 division, peel regional police;
(ii)
hearsay
statements attributed to alleged victim #1, “k.l.”; and,
(iii)
hearsay statements
attributed to alleged victim #2, “n.b.”.
the issues regarding the accused’s statement are
voluntariness at common law and compliance with
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
canadian charter of rights and freedoms
, particularly at the point when
his legal jeopardy changed from charges of assault and breach of undertaking to
human
‑
trafficking related offences. if a breach is established, exclusion
under section 24(2) must be considered.
the
voir dires
on these issues proceeded in
a blended proceeding to the trial evidence, with the consent of all parties.
for the reasons set out below,
the video statement of mr. laguerre is excluded
. it was obtained in violation of his rights under
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
. further, from the moment he commences the
interview with detective constable douglas, to point he was re-cautioned well into the interview on
the more serious charges of human trafficking, the statement is inadmissible at
common law as involuntary.
in contrast,
i find
the hearsay statements of k.l. and n.b. admissible
with
some minor exceptions. some aspects meet the traditional exception of
res
gestae
exception, while others satisfy
the principled exception to the hearsay rule. with
necessity conceded by the defence, the crown has established, on a balance of
probabilities, that the statements are sufficiently reliable to meet the
threshold for admissibility under the
bradshaw
framework.
a.
an overview of the evidence.
mr. laguerre faces allegations of human
trafficking related offences, breaching an undertaking, assault, and uttering
threats. the complainants, k.l. and n.b., did not attend to testify despite
being subpoenaed. the crown therefore relies on their prior statements and
video-recorded interviews, together with corroborative evidence.
the crown called peel regional police officers
ben couce, daniel bolarinho, patricia hunt, kenaul douglas, giacomo brunino,
cassidy thurston, danielle dalton, and sergeant mark bennewitz. through their
testimony, the crown introduced body-worn camera footage, in-car camera
recordings, cctv footage from 12 division (including visible wall clocks), and
video-recorded statements from both mr. laguerre and n.b. the 911 call made by
k.l. was also filed as an exhibit. the crown also filed, on consent, an
extraction report of a phone alleged to be the “trap phone” of mr. laguerre,
and photographs of seized property and alleged injuries of the complainants.
the officers’ evidence outlines the sequence of
events on october 12, 2024, beginning with the 911 call placed by k.l. at
approximately 4:15 p.m. and continuing through mr. laguerre’s arrest, transport
to 12 division, and his interview later that evening. their testimony provides
essential context for the administration of mr. laguerre’s rights to counsel
and the circumstances surrounding the statement now in issue.
the evidence also forms the foundation for
determining the admissibility of hearsay statements attributed to k.l. and n.b.
while there is some overlap, certain officers relate primarily to voluntariness
and
charter
compliance, whereas others address the reliability and
necessity of the complainants’ hearsay statements.
every attending officer—couce, bennewitz, hunt,
thurston, and bolarinho—was equipped with an active body-worn camera capturing
both audio and video. this footage, together with in-car transport video, cctv
recordings, and video interviews, documented all material interactions between
officers, the accused, and the complainants. these recordings, filed as
exhibits, provide a comprehensive, contemporaneous, multi-perspective, and
highly reliable evidentiary record for review and commentary during the
respective witnesses’ testimony. for some of this footage, corresponding
transcripts were filed.
as explained in detail below, an exception in
this timeline occurred when the booking officer, acting under the direction of
the staff sergeant, instructed constable couce to deactivate his body-worn
camera. as a result, only silent cctv footage is available for the period
during which mr. laguerre was booked, re-cautioned on his rights to counsel,
and afforded the opportunity to implement or waive his right to counsel of
choice. this gap is significant because it coincides with a major change in
jeopardy and the re-administration of rights under
section 10
(b).
a
detailed chronology of mr. laguerre’s detention, arrest, and statement is set
out in appendix a.
a
detailed chronology of the cctv footage is set out in appendix b.
part ii – a detailed review of the
evidence
b.
the 911 call
on october 12, 2024, at approximately 4:15 p.m.,
k.l. placed an emotional 911 call from a gas station connected to the super 8
motel at 6625 kennedy road in mississauga.
the audio recording of this call was filed as an
exhibit as was a corresponding transcript.
k.l. reported that her boyfriend, identified by
the caller as “wooldy laguerre” (911 call transcript, page 12), had assaulted
her moments earlier in room 408 of the motel. she stated, “my boyfriend keeps
hitting me” and “he took my phone.” she explained that she fled wearing only a
t-shirt, without pants or personal belongings, and was inside the gas station
seeking help.
k.l. told the operator that the accused struck
her with a phone charger cable and punched her repeatedly, leaving her bruised.
she confirmed that the assault occurred “just right now.” when asked if she
required medical assistance, she declined, stating, “yeah, i’m not hurt.”
k.l. repeatedly expressed concern that the
accused would leave with her belongings and money if he became aware that
police had been called. she stated, “i can’t go back to montreal.”
she claimed the accused took her money from her
and will leave if he knows she called police. she advised that the money he
took from her was from her “work”.
k.l. confirmed that she, and the other female
present in the room, work for him as an escort and they had been staying at the
hotel for a couple of days, with a reservation continuing until october 15.
she alleged that the other female falsely
accused her of calling 911, which triggered the assault. k.l. confirmed that
both women had been working for him for approximately a year and a half.
she provided the accused’s name, approximate age
(31–32), physical description (heavy build), clothing (black t-shirt and black
jeans), and stated that he drove a grey honda civic with a quebec trip permit
displayed as a paper document in the rear window, rather than a standard
licence plate. she confirmed that she did not believe the other female was in
immediate danger.
at one point, k.l. believed she saw the accused
inside the gas station and began to panic, but then stated she was unsure.
throughout the call, k.l. was distraught, and
the operator repeatedly asked her to slow down due to difficulty understanding
her.
k.l. admitted to using cocaine earlier in the
day, along with the other female, but said the accused was sober. throughout
the call, she repeatedly urged police to attend quickly, fearing that mr.
laguerre would flee with her property.
when asked if the accused had a weapon, she
replied “no, i don’t think so.”
the call concluded as officers arrived on scene
and k.l. left the gas station to meet them. the call lasted approximately 26
minutes.
c.
the evidence of attending, arrest, statement, right to counsel, and
transport officers
i.
evidence of constable bolarinho
constable daniel bolarinho of peel regional
police was on uniform patrol with 12 division on october 12, 2024. he arrived
at the super 8 motel at approximately 4:30 p.m. in response to the 911 call.
his body-worn camera footage
captures the complainant k.l. outside the hotel wearing a black
shirt and no pants. she appeared distressed and was pacing. constable bolarinho
observed visible bruising on her face and marks on her arm. although upset, she
communicated in english and declined medical assistance. he did not detect
signs of impairment.
acting on information from k.l. that the accused
was in room 408 with another female, officers proceeded to that room. they
knocked and announced “police” but received no response. under what i find were
exigent circumstances—concern for the safety of another potential victim and
the immediacy of the reported assault—sergeant bennewitz obtained a key and
officers entered. the room was unoccupied and in disarray, with personal
belongings strewn about. no items were searched or seized. officers exited and
continued efforts to locate the accused.
he and other officers exited the fourth floor
via the hotel stairwell. as they were descending, information came over the
radio that the person of interest, later to be determined as wooldy laguerre,
was seen outside the hotel.
at 4:48:42 p.m., near the adjacent esso station,
officers observed a male in a red shirt with a female in a grey tracksuit,
matching descriptions provided by k.l. at 4:49:33 p.m., mr. laguerre was
detained by constables couce and bennewitz without significant force. he walked
calmly and did not attempt to flee. at 4:51 p.m., a pat-down search was
conducted, and at 4:51:30 p.m. he was arrested for assault and breach of
conditions. he was placed in a police cruiser at 4:52:05 p.m. a beige satchel
was searched for identification at 4:52:30 p.m.; cash was located, and the
satchel was secured in the front seat.
constable bolarinho did not personally question
mr. laguerre but was in close proximity and heard no threats, promises, or
inducements. he confirmed that mr. laguerre appeared coherent and not impaired.
at 4:55:30 p.m., constable hunt delivered the right to counsel in french. at
5:01:54 p.m., mr. laguerre requested to speak with a lawyer, providing the name
“patrick bouler.” officers attempted to obtain contact information and later
facilitated a private call at the station. constable bolarinho emphasized that
privacy could not be assured at the scene due to recording equipment and public
presence.
constable bolarinho later transported k.l. to 12
division. the transport video (exhibit 11) shows her using her phone, eating,
and scrolling social media. there were no substantive discussions during
transport.
in cross-examination, constable bolarinho
acknowledged that he did not hear the original 911 call but received
information via dispatch. he confirmed that exigent circumstances justified the
entry into room 408, based on the report of domestic violence and the
possibility of another victim being present. he stated that he had reasonable
and probable grounds to believe mr. laguerre was arrestable for assault at
4:48:40 p.m., but he was not the arresting officer.
constable bolarinho testified that he did not
turn his mind to human trafficking charges at the time, although he was aware
that sergeant bennewitz intended to liaise with other bureaus regarding that
possibility. he emphasized that privacy in the cruiser could not be guaranteed
due to audio and video recording, and that the station was a more appropriate
location for facilitating a private conversation with counsel.
ii.
evidence of sergeant bennewitz
sergeant mark bennewitz has served with peel
regional police since april 2004. on october 12, 2024, he was working a night
shift as a uniform patrol sergeant assigned to 12 division, c platoon. at 16:26
hours, he received a radio dispatch reporting that a female had been assaulted
by a male at the super 8 motel located at 6625 kennedy road in mississauga. the
male’s whereabouts were unknown. sergeant bennewitz arrived at the motel at
approximately 16:37 hours. he was the supervising sergeant on scene.
his body-worn camera recording, filed as an
exhibit, begins at approximately 16:38 and captures the dynamic sequence of
events leading to the accused’s detention, arrest, and discussions to
facilitate his rights to counsel and caution in french.
upon arrival, he observed several officers
already on scene and the complainant, k.l., outside speaking with them.
sergeant bennewitz and other officers had
blocked a grey honda civic believed to be associated with the accused. the
recording captures discussion of the vehicle associated with the accused. this
was a grey honda civic bearing no plates but displaying a quebec trip permit
valid until october 2.
k.l. identified room 408 as the location of the
assault and advised that she did not believe the accused had any weapons. she
appeared disheveled and exhibited visible injuries, including what seemed to be
a black eye and bruising. sergeant bennewitz noted that she was excitable and
possibly intoxicated, though he could not confirm impairment. he did not detect
alcohol on her breath.
acting on information from k.l. that the accused
and another female might still be in room 408, and concerned for the safety of
any additional victims, sergeant bennewitz directed officers to remain with the
complainant while he and two other officers proceeded to the room.
after knocking and receiving no response, he
returned to the front desk, obtained a key card, and re-entered room 408 at
16:46 hours. he announced police presence and cleared the room, which was
unoccupied and in disarray. no items were searched or seized. he explained that
entry without warrant was justified by exigent circumstances: the need to
ensure no further victims were present, the immediacy of the reported assault,
and the inability to secure the scene fully given limited resources and public
safety concerns.
in cross-examination, he agreed that he did not
hear noises or cries for help and that k.l. had said the accused was not armed.
he acknowledged that his assumption of risk to the second female was not based
on specific information from k.l. but on his experience and the context of the
assault. he also confirmed that he did not identify himself as police when
initially knocking and gave no thought to securing the room as a crime scene,
though he observed white powdery substances inside.
after clearing room 408, he exited and continued
efforts to locate the male. none of the officers attempted to search the room
or personal belongings. their time spent in the room was brief and purposive to
the end of locating the male and female party.
at 16:48 hours, radio updates indicated that the
male was near the esso station, wearing a red shirt and accompanied by a female
in a grey tracksuit. at 16:49 hours, sergeant bennewitz approached the accused,
later identified as wooldy laguerre.
the body-worn camera recording, filed as exhibit
28a, begins at 16:38 and captures the sequence of events (along with all other
material interactions that day).
the body-worn camera footage captures in video
and audio sergeant bennewitz approaching mr. laguerre near the hotel and asking
to speak with him. mr. laguerre agreed. bennewitz instructed him to keep his
hands out of his pockets and asked if he was staying in room 408, which mr.
laguerre denied. when bennewitz confirmed that mr. laguerre spoke little
english, he directed him to walk toward a police vehicle to discuss the
situation. bennewitz asked if mr. laguerre was from montreal, which he
confirmed, and then explained that police had received information suggesting
he might have assaulted a woman. mr. laguerre denied the allegation and also
denied having anything on him that he should not have.
he testified that utterances did not contribute
to his grounds for arrest on the assault and breach, which were established
independently and prior to this interaction. none of these utterances are being
led as part of the crown’s case.
he testified that the accused was not detained
until physical contact was made when the officer touched his right arm. he
explained that he delayed advising reasons for detention immediately because of
safety concerns: the accused was a large male carrying a satchel, wearing loose
clothing that could conceal weapons, and was in close proximity to members of
the public. he considered it safer to move the accused to an area where
additional officers were present before providing full information.
the accused was compliant, did not attempt to
flee and followed directions.
in cross-examination, sergeant bennewitz agreed
that he asked questions before providing a caution or advising reasons for detention,
including whether the accused was from room 408, whether he was from montreal,
and whether he had anything on him that he should not have. he acknowledged
that these were potentially incriminating questions and that the right to
counsel and reasons for detention were not given until later. he maintained
that, in his view, the circumstances justified the delay for safety reasons,
though he accepted that in ideal conditions these rights should be provided
immediately.
the footage also records officers confirming
that mr. laguerre was subject to conditions prohibiting contact with k.l. and
discussing contacting the vice unit, noting his prior involvement in human
trafficking investigations. at 16:55 hours, arrangements were made for
constable hunt to deliver the right to counsel in french, acknowledging mr.
laguerre’s claim that he would not understand his rights in english.
after the arrest, sergeant bennewitz contacted
the vice unit because k.l. had indicated she was an escort. he requested
constable dalton to assist with translation. he testified that he had no
grounds to arrest for human trafficking offences and did not inform mr.
laguerre of any such allegations. he left the scene shortly thereafter and
returned to 12 division to brief vice officers. the body-worn camera was muted
during the vice call, which he explained was due to telephone use, though he
acknowledged current policy requires the camera to remain on. the footage
concludes at approximately 00:16 hours with confirmation that mr. laguerre was
in custody and preparations to liaise with the vice unit.
iii.
evidence of constable hunt
constable patricia hunt attended the super 8
motel on october 12, 2024, as part of the initial response. at the time, she
was in the second phase of field training and paired with her coach officer,
constable thurston. hunt is bilingual and was asked to assist with french
interpretation during the investigation.
her body-worn camera recording, filed as an
exhibit, begins at approximately 16:41 and captures her interaction with k.l.
near the hotel entrance. speaking primarily in french, hunt asked k.l.
questions about the nature of her relationship with the accused and the
circumstances of the assault. k.l. stated that she had fled the room without
pants and confirmed that the assault occurred in room 408. she reported that
the accused struck her with an iphone charger cord and kicked her multiple
times, leaving visible bruises. hunt observed injuries on k.l.’s face,
shoulder, and back, which k.l. attributed to the accused. hunt confirmed that
k.l. appeared anxious but coherent and declined medical assistance.
during this exchange, k.l. disclosed that she
and the accused were intimate partners for approximately a year and a half and
that she also engaged in sexual activity for money. hunt asked clarifying
questions about whether the relationship was romantic or transactional, and
k.l. confirmed that it was both. k.l. further stated that she and another
female, later identified as n.b., had been staying at the motel for several
days and that the accused acted as their pimp. hunt documented these statements
and later photographed injuries on both complainants, as well as the hotel
telephone identified as the object used in the assault.
the footage also captures hunt obtaining
identification details from both complainants and discussing their safety
concerns. n.b. expressed fear of an individual named “julian,” alleging that he
had been paid to harm her and that he possessed a firearm in montreal. hunt
reassured both women and explained that protective measures, including referral
to a specialized unit, would be arranged. hunt testified that these statements
were unsolicited and made spontaneously during the interaction.
at approximately 16:55, hunt delivered the
accused’s rights to counsel in french after officers determined that mr.
laguerre would not understand his rights in english. she read the caution and
informational components from her notebook, advising him of his right to retain
and instruct counsel without delay, his right to legal aid, and the
availability of duty counsel. mr. laguerre confirmed understanding and
requested to speak with a lawyer immediately. he provided the name of his
lawyer in montreal, “patrick boulet,” and indicated that officers could locate
the contact information online. hunt testified that she did not make any
threats, promises, or inducements and did not hear any other officer do so. she
emphasized that the caution was provided promptly once the scene was secure and
that officers acted in good faith to comply with
section 10
(a) and
10
(b)
obligations.
the specific utterances that the crown seeks to
introduce under the hearsay exception, made by k.l. and n.b. during their
recorded interaction with constable hunt, will be addressed in detail under the
analysis section of this ruling. it is sufficient to note at this stage that
the transcript accurately reflects the translated conversation captured on
hunt’s body-worn camera and forms part of the evidentiary record.
sergeant bennewitz acknowledged that his
body-worn camera was muted during the telephone call to the vice unit. he
explained that this occurred because he was speaking over the phone and, at the
time, believed muting was permissible in such circumstances. he further
testified that he was a senior officer who had been slow to adopt body-worn
camera technology and that his understanding of policy has evolved. he now
applies the current standard requiring continuous recording but clarified that
this expectation reflects present policy rather than what he understood to be
required on october 12, 2024. he made it clear that now, the policy is that it
should be all the time except in rare circumstances (for which he did not
elaborate upon or was questioned upon).
iv.
evidence of constable couce
constable ben couce of peel regional police was
among the first officers to respond to the 911 call on october 12, 2024 at
approximately 16:37, his body-worn camera footage, filed as an exhibit,
provides a detailed record of his interactions with the accused and other
officers during the arrest and subsequent procedures.
couce assisted in locating the accused near the
esso station adjacent to the super 8 motel. at approximately 16:49, he and
sergeant bennewitz detained mr. laguerre. the accused was calm, cooperative,
and did not attempt to flee. couce held the accused by the forearms while
directing him toward the police cruiser at the front of the hotel where
officers first attended. he did this as the front of the hotel was a more
controlled environment with more officers present, police vehicles, and to
avoid possible escalation and for safety reasons.
while detained, mr. laguerre asked “what’s the
problem?” and bennewitz replied, “we heard a story about you hitting a girl,” to
which the accused denied.
couce’s footage also captures the search of a
beige satchel in the accused’s possession at 16:52:30. the search was limited
to identification and safety purposes. no identification was found, but a
significant amount of cash was observed. keys to a vehicle, presumed to be the
one of interest, were also seized. the satchel was secured in the front seat of
the cruiser. couce testified that he did not make any threats, promises, or
inducements to the accused and did not hear any other officer do so. his footage
also captured the vehicle that mr. laguerre was allegedly operating along with
a trip permit affixed in the rear-view window. a photo of that trip permit
sticker was entered as an exhibit.
at 16:51, a pat-down search was conducted, and
at 16:51:30, mr. laguerre was formally arrested for assault and breach of
conditions. he did not consider human trafficking charges at that stage as he
did not then have grounds for these charges. under re-examination, he also
testified that it would be unusual for officers to lay human trafficking
offences without first obtaining input or delegating that decision to the vice
unit.
at 16:53:50, couce attempted to deliver the
right to counsel in english. the accused indicated that he did not understand
and spoke only french. constable hunt subsequently provided the caution and
informational components in french at 16:55. constable hunt was chosen to
deliver the caution rather than using an interpreter app because she was on
scene and this was considered the most efficient option. he indicated it would
leave it to the judgment of constable hunt to determine whether she was capable
of such a task and language proficiency.
constable couce testified that he deferred implementation
of the right to counsel until arrival at the station because privacy could not
be assured at the scene. he explained that body-worn cameras are highly
sensitive and could capture conversations unintentionally, and that the
presence of other officers and members of the public further compromised
confidentiality. constable couce acknowledged under cross-examination that a
call to counsel at the scene was possible, but maintained that a private,
soundproof room at the station was the most appropriate setting. on
re-examination, he added that he would not have permitted mr. laguerre to use
his own phone because it contained potential evidence that could be deleted.
he admitted that he was not aware that the
in-car camera was not recording (although his body camera with audio and video
remained active). this was an oversight on his part as he returned from cib
work and was not yet familiar with what was relatively new technology to him at
the time.
mr. laguerre was transported from the hotel at
5:07 p.m., arriving at 12 division at 5:17 p.m., and entering the sally port at
5:19 p.m. prior to arrival, he notified his staff sergeant he had someone in custody
and he was bringing him to the station for booking.
a notable gap in the otherwise comprehensive
audio-video record occurred during the booking process.
the booking officer, acting on the direction of
the staff sergeant, instructed constable couce to deactivate his body-worn
camera. couce testified that he muted audio briefly when the staff sergeant was
on the phone and later restored it. as a result, only silent cctv footage is
available for much of this period, which coincides with critical events: mr.
laguerre was booked, re-cautioned on his rights to counsel, and afforded the
opportunity to implement or waive his right to counsel of choice. constable
couce could not recall the exact words exchanged and could not rule out that wl
was told he could not speak to a quebec lawyer.
during this exchange with the staff sergeant,
the following can be observed on the cctv footage: mr. laguerre yawns, shakes
his head “no,” and stands for a pat-down search against the wall. he then sits
on the bench, places his head down, and rubs his head and face. at
approximately 5:25 p.m., mr. laguerre is seen with arms crossed while the staff
sergeant speaks. mr. laguerre appears to listen and nod intermittently. at 5:27
p.m., mr. laguerre engages in a back-and-forth with the staff sergeant, who
does most of the talking. mr. laguerre’s posture alternates between arms crossed
and head in hands. the interaction continues until approximately 5:37 p.m.,
when constable couce’s notebook indicates that rights to counsel were
discussed.
constable couce testified that he could not
recall the exact words exchanged but agreed that the staff sergeant led the
conversation and mr. laguerre mostly followed along. constable couce could not
rule out that mr. laguerre was told he could not speak to a quebec lawyer
during this period as he did not recall the specifics of what was said.
at approximately 5:27 p.m., couce testified that
he attempted to contact mr. laguerre’s counsel of choice, identified as mr.
patrick boulet. the search terms did not include the proper spelling, asking
mr. laguerre for the proper spelling, or using the additional search term
“montreal” to enhance the search. during this time, mr. laguerre changed his
request to duty counsel. couce stated that neither he nor any other officer
suggested this change and that mr. laguerre made the request independently. at
5:30 p.m., couce called duty counsel and asked mr. laguerre for his preferred
language. mr. laguerre responded “english,” which couce found notable given the
earlier request for rights to counsel in french.
couce confirmed that no officers made any
threats, promises, or inducements to mr. laguerre, nor was he compelled to
provide a statement. under cross-examination, he stated that his primary
concern throughout was the safety of the complainant and any other potential
victims. he acknowledged that the decision to enter room 408 without a warrant
was based on exigent circumstances, specifically the need to ensure no one
inside was in immediate danger. although this rationale was not documented in
his notes, he maintained that it was the basis for the entry.
v.
evidence of constable thurston
cassidy thurston, a uniform officer, testified
that on october 12, 2024, she attended the super 8 hotel in mississauga with
constable hunt in response to a report of assault. she was acting as a training
officer, or “coach”, for constable hunt that day.
as she and constable hunt arrived, she noticed a
male in a red shirt, later identified as wooldy laguerre, and a female in a
grey tracksuit near a gas station adjacent to the hotel. she did not engage
with these two individuals as her focus was on first speaking to the
complainant on the 911 call.
except for a brief interruption while speaking
to sergeant bennewitz, all of thurston’s activities in this investigation, and
importantly during her interactions with the complainants, were captured in
video and audio on her body-worn camera. this provides a valuable and reliable
record for review. this footage was filed as an exhibit to the proceedings. her
viva voce
testimony was inextricable with the body-worn camera that was
played into evidence in her presence.
thurston also explained her body-worn camera practices.
she turned the camera off only when not interacting with the public or the
accused, and when discussing investigative techniques, and re
‑
activated it upon re
‑
engaging. she agreed the general rule is to keep the camera on.
thurston testified that she relied on constable
hunt to interpret cpic conditions that appeared in french. hunt relayed that
one condition prohibited contact with k.l., which thurston understood and
recognized by name. no details about duration were conveyed. from her experience,
cpic conditions are typically current, though even if they proved outdated an
arrest on breach could be effected and verified thereafter.
thurston recognized the male from a prior
traffic stop in may 2024 but did not approach him immediately. she met the
complainant, k.l., at the front of the hotel. k.l. appeared upset and spoke
partly in french, requiring hunt to assist with translation. thurston observed
a visible mark on k.l.’s leg and later, in the hotel room, whip-like injuries
on her shoulder.
on her body-worn camera, beginning at
approximately 16:43, thurston questioned k.l. about the nature of the
relationship between k.l. and mr. laguerre, including whether they were
intimate and whether the male was her “pimp.” k.l. indicated “yes” to intimacy
and, in context, to him being her “pimp,” and further agreed that she did it
for money. some ambiguity on this exchange was raised by defence counsel on
what this meant in cross-examination, so it is best to look to the exact
wording of what took place from the translated transcript (conceded as
accurate) from constable hunt’s body-worn camera:
hunt:  are you
intimate with each other?
k.l.     yes
hunt:  yes.
are you like boyfriend and girlfriend?
k.l:    yes
hunt: for how
long?
k.l:    a
year and a half.
hunt: a year
and a half? one and a half year they're intimate.
thurston: they're
intimate because he's her pimp?
hunt: okay.
but you have relations?
k.l:    yes.
hunt: yes
thurston: so
she does it because she gets money from him? she gets financial gain?
hunt: when you fuck, is it
for money or is it just like... are you together?
k.l.     yes
hunt:  is it
for money?
k.l.     also
yes.
hunt:  yes? so
both.
thurston:
start asking... because we're going to invest [inaudible 00:04:36] domestic
now. start asking your regular domestic stuff.
thurston accepted there was some ambiguity in
phrasing but understood the answers to refer to escorting rather than mere
intimacy. at that time, she did not pursue detailed human
‑
trafficking questioning. she explained that she first approached the
matter as a domestic relationship investigation, with a developing concern when
k.l. later stated that the male was holding some of her money.
she added that at approximately 16:50, when k.l.
mentioned that the male was holding her money, this triggered concern but she
did not ask where the money came from. k.l. stated that “all the money he has
on him, it’s all ours.”
at 16:52, sergeant bennewitz raised whether vice should become
involved. thurston agreed, explaining that she had never investigated a human‑trafficking
offence before and believed vice officers could “connect the dots” to establish
reasonable and probable grounds if warranted.
thurston was aware that n.b. had an outstanding
warrant from sherbrooke for obstruct. although this gave her some concern about
reliability, she emphasized her duty to remain unbiased and to allow n.b. to
explain. based on n.b.’s observed distress, including hysteria upon seeing k.l.,
she did not believe n.b. was fabricating to avoid arrest. she accepted that
n.b. expressed worry about being in toronto.
thurston permitted the complainants to collect
belongings in the presence of officers. no steps were taken to determine
ownership of a particular bag. thurston was mindful of possible drug residue
after a comment from sergeant bennewitz and cautioned her junior officer
accordingly. she did not observe drug consumption and said she would have
intervened if it had occurred.
she did not search the complainants on exit and
could not say whether they left with drugs or other evidentiary items. her
direction on body-worn camera included, “don’t take everything… just take some
stuff.” she did not check the complainants before they left and could not say
whether they departed with drugs or other evidentiary items.
thurston noted that nb mentioned “speed” and
fake identification cards in the room, though she did not observe consumption.
thurston said one phone was seized from the
accused and no other phone matching the complainant’s description was found.
she did not return any device to the complainants. she did not ask k.l. about
the source of the money but agreed that the information that the accused was
holding k.l.’s money raised concern that she was being trafficked by mr.
laguerre. in particular, the following exchange took place and captured on
body-worn camera footage:
“k.l.: “am i
going to be able to take my money and my phone?”
hunt: “he has
her phone and her money in his property.”
when she remarked, “how does he expect to pimp
you out with those marks?”, she explained, in response to questioning from
defence counsel, that this reflected astonishment about visible injuries in the
context of exploitation, and did not cause her to doubt that trafficking could
be occurring.
k.l. and n.b. expressed fear that an unknown male
(“julian”) might be on his way to harm them.
thurston assisted hunt in explaining to k.l. and
n.b. that any statements they were to provide was their choice and confirming
that that were prepared to provide one. she did not hear any threats, promises,
or inducements made to either woman towards this end.
in the hotel room, she assisted constable hunt
in documenting injuries of k.l. and n.b., and in retrieving their belongings
before they left to 12 division.
thurston confirmed that the scene was never
fully secure but did not perceive exigent circumstances requiring immediate
arrest. she acknowledged asking a question about pimping on her body-worn
camera, influenced by prior radio information, but stated she was uncertain
about the threshold for human trafficking charges and would ordinarily consult
vice before laying such charges. in her view, vice should be contacted because
they have greater experience with human
‑
trafficking
investigations and could determine whether grounds existed.
thurston acknowledged that while rights to
counsel can occur at the scene, privacy concerns often make this impractical.
she had no specific knowledge of whether any steps were taken at the roadside
to implement mr. laguerre’s request to speak to counsel.
both k.l. and n.b. appeared emotional but
coherent, and thurston described them as receptive to police assistance despite
the language barrier.
thurston acknowledged that k.l. and n.b. were
within earshot at points and that brief exchanges in french occurred. in hindsight,
she agreed that separating them earlier for discrete accounts would have been
preferable to avoid the possibility of them tainting each other’s evidence or
colluding on details. through body-worn camera footage, there was attention
drawn to this in the exchange: ”:
thurston: ok,
so we'll continue to get information from her. we're going to transport them
back so they can give statements. ask her if she's going to talk.
k.l.: yeah.
thurston:
yeah? like, you'll provide a statement of police. [inaudible 00:26:19]
hunt: are you
going to talk to the police? can they go together?
thurston: [inaudible
00:26:20] they are not going to be able to be in the same room but they can
stay together while we [inaudible 00:26:22] to [inaudible 00:26:27] down there?
hunt: okay,
you can’t make a statement together. since you can’t be in the same room, but
you can, we can bring you together.
d.
the involvement of vice officers
i.
evidence of detective constable brunino
detective constable giacomo brunino, a ten‑year
member of peel regional police and assigned to the vice and human trafficking
unit for approximately two years, became involved in the investigation on
october 12, 2024, following the arrest of mr. laguerre and reports from two
females alleging that he was acting as their trafficker. he attended 12
division and received his initial briefing from constable couce at 6:23 p.m.,
followed by additional briefings from other attending officers. these concluded
at 7:15 p.m. brunino explained that such briefings are standard practice when
vice officers were not present at the scene, enabling them to assess evidence
collected and determine investigative priorities.
detective constable brunino’s direct contact
with mr. laguerre was limited to moving him from cells to the interview room
with constable douglas. this movement is captured on division cctv: the
“bullpen” hallway clip and the “booking room to interview room” clip. brunino
made no comments to the accused, saw no threats or promises made, and noted no
impairment. while there is no audio for these brief interactions with the
accused, i find that, unlike the booking video, it has no material probative
value to my rulings and accept his evidence that there were no threats,
inducements, or promises that might apply to the issues of voluntariness.
brunino itemized significant property seized from mr. laguerre and
lodged it with prp property:
•
canadian currency $4,100 (various
denominations), u.s. currency $100, one cell phone, and one swiss gold bar;
each in separate property bags; lodged at 180 derry road. property tag numbers:
currency #1732181, gold bar #1732180, cell phone #1732182.
•
a few days later, the currency bag was unsealed
and counted at the booking desk, on camera, and the count was documented in the
booking system; the accused was present.
•
on october 13, 2024, brunino seized another cell
phone described as a white apple iphone from k.l. at a hotel “safe place” in
brampton at 3:12 p.m. k.l. indicated it was the device used to communicate with
clients.
brunino interacted briefly with k.l. between 7:15 p.m. and 7:47 p.m.
in a side room at 12 division. he described her as groggy and intermittently
responsive, speaking in broken english. she confirmed that she worked for the
accused, used the name “jessica” in advertisements, and identified herself in
leolist photographs. brunino did not press for a formal statement and made no
threats or promises.
brunino later traced leolist advertisements using the phone number
(438) 8xx
‑
0xx3 and email j[xxxxx].b[xxxxxxxx]@yahoo.ca, confirmed by k.l. on
october 15, 2024, leolist provided associated data, which brunino downloaded to
a usb and lodged as property.
brunino conducted the video
‑
recorded statement of n.b.
with the assistance of a bilingual officer (dalton, badge #4803). the interview
commenced at approximately 7:30 p.m. and concluded around 8:30 p.m. brunino
testified that n.b. appeared sad but responsive, with no signs of impairment or
coercion. he emphasized that no threats, promises, or inducements were made.
exhibits include the original video (exhibit 4a) and english translation
(exhibit 4b). this timing is significant to the analysis under
section 10
(b),
as reasonable and probable grounds for human
‑
trafficking
‑
related offences crystallized immediately upon the conclusion of
n.b.’s interview.
[emphasis added]
brunino later attended room 408 at the super 8 motel with other
officers. body
‑
worn camera footage depicts a lived
‑
in
environment with sex paraphernalia, drug paraphernalia (including a spoon,
syringe, powder, and scale), and liquor, corroborating the complainants’
accounts. brunino also identified photographs documenting seized items: usd
$100, the white iphone, canadian currency, and the swiss gold bar.
brunino confirmed that, based on his briefings, he understood the
accused had spoken with duty counsel and that rights to counsel were first
attempted in english and then provided in french. he observed no mistreatment
of the accused or any threats, promises, or inducements made in his presence.
ii.
evidence of detective constable kenaul douglas
detective constable kenaul douglas of the peel regional police vice
unit became involved in the investigation later in the evening of october 12,
2024. at the time of initial developments, douglas was engaged in an unrelated
human trafficking investigation in oakville. he testified that he first learned
of this matter at approximately 5:13 p.m. and did not arrive at 12 division
until 7:53 p.m., after the complainant n.b.’s statement had concluded and
reasonable and probable grounds for human trafficking related offences had
clearly formed within the peel regional police vice unit.
upon arrival, douglas received a briefing from detective constable
brunino and proceeded to the cell area to prepare for an interview of mr.
laguerre. at about 8:57 p.m., property previously seized from the accused was
processed. douglas introduced himself to mr. laguerre in the cells, explained
that they would move to an interview room, and escorted him upstairs with the
assistance of brunino and the booking officer. douglas testified that he made
no threats or promises, observed no mistreatment in his presence, and that mr.
laguerre was calm, communicative, and did not appear impaired; the accused
spoke in english and did not request a french interpreter.
the interview room recording began at 8:52 p.m. mr. laguerre was
brought into the room at about 9:00 p.m., left alone, and douglas returned at
9:23 p.m., identifying himself as “douglas.” immediately on re‑entry,
douglas stated he needed to complete a “template” that was “nothing to do with
the actual case,” after which mr. laguerre asked, “that’s a new charge?”
douglas replied there were “some new charges,” but deferred addressing them and
proceeded with the “template.”
between approximately 9:24 p.m. and 9:32 p.m., douglas asked a
series of “template” questions that elicited personal and potentially
incriminating information, including full name, date of birth, address, phone
number for the seized device, employment, social media and email usage,
physical descriptors, tattoos, and immigration history. these questions and
answers occurred before mr. laguerre was advised of the new, more serious
charges or re‑advised of his rights to counsel in relation to those
charges.
at 9:32 p.m., douglas stated on the recording, “now it’s 9:32 p.m.
and i’m gonna advise you of the new charges,” first confirming that mr.
laguerre had already spoken to a lawyer, to which mr. laguerre said he had.
douglas then read out the additional charges, including human trafficking (two
counts), receiving and deriving a material benefit, exercise of control,
advertising sexual services, assault with a weapon, and uttering threats, in
addition to the existing assault and fail to comply charges. after reading
these charges, douglas provided a right‑to‑silence caution and
asked, “would you like to speak to your lawyer about the new charges, or…,” and
mr. laguerre declined, saying, “no, i’m good.” substantive questioning began
immediately thereafter.
from 9:35 p.m. onward, douglas questioned mr. laguerre about his
time in mississauga, travel from montreal, relationships with the complainants,
and related topics. douglas also asked about the seized cash, the phone and
anticipated search warrant, and the swiss gold bar. later in the interview,
douglas served “notices of intention” concerning breach documentation, video
surveillance, and text messages, explaining they would be used as evidence; the
service occurs around 10:49–10:51 p.m. on the recording. mr. laguerre was
removed from the interview room at 10:54 p.m., and the recording ends at 11:00
p.m.
mr. laguerre showed signs of fatigue at points; he remained alert
and responsive, demonstrated a strong command of english, and answered
questions thoughtfully, which supports that he was operating with a clear and
functioning mind during the interview.
douglas agreed in his testimony that he did not re‑advise mr.
laguerre of his rights to counsel before commencing the “template” questions,
explaining that he “went with the flow” when the accused appeared anxious about
“new charges.” he further acknowledged that the information sought on the form,
including phone numbers and social media accounts, could be used to locate
leolist advertisements and was investigative in nature, not strictly
administrative identification.
part iii: analysis of
the rights to counsel, reasons for detention, and voluntariness:
the defence submits that mr. laguerre’s rights under
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
were breached.
as it relates to
s. 10
(a), for approximately six minutes after being
restrained, police did not inform mr. laguerre of the reasons for his detention.
nor did they disclose investigative elements relating to human trafficking,
despite their immediate awareness of that possible connection to the underlying
allegations. mr. laguerre was not advised of this investigative focus until
more than four hours later.
the defence argues that s. 10(b) was breached through a series of
failures affecting both the informational and implementational duties:
(i) an initial
delay in advising mr. laguerre of his right to counsel;
(ii) no effort
to permit a roadside call, with non
‑
urgent tasks taking
priority over his rights; and
(iii) failure
to implement his right to counsel of choice and in his preferred language, as
he ultimately spoke to duty counsel in english despite requesting a french
‑
speaking lawyer by name.
the defence also points to a change in jeopardy when human
trafficking charges were formally added by the vice unit, without re
‑
cautioning or providing mr. laguerre an immediate opportunity to
consult counsel about this development. this occurred during intake
questioning, presented as routine pre
‑
interview inquiries,
during which he made several incriminating admissions, thereby violating both
s. 10(a)
and
s. 10(b)
of the
charter
.
the defence submits that these cumulative breaches created a serious
risk of self-incrimination and prevented mr. laguerre from making informed
decisions. it asks that his statement be excluded under section 24(2), or, if
admitted, that his sentence be reduced under section 24(1).
in addition to the
charter
breaches, the defence submits that
mr. laguerre’s video-recorded interview statement was not voluntary at common
law as he was uninformed his right to silence on the questions posed to him by
the vice unit in form of intake, or pre-interview questions that related to serious
human trafficking allegations.
the crown submits that police complied with
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
, or that any delay in advising mr. laguerre of his
reasons for detention or his rights to counsel was brief, justified, and does
not warrant exclusion.
regarding s. 10(a), the crown argues that mr. laguerre was told the
reason for his detention in general terms within about one minute when he
asked, “what is this about?”, and that the later advisement of human
trafficking charges reflected the evolving nature of the investigation.
on section 10(b), the crown argues that the right to counsel was
implemented as soon as reasonably practicable, including in french, and that
mr. laguerre spoke to duty counsel promptly upon arrival at the station. it
emphasizes that officers acted diligently, facilitated access to counsel, and
offered a second opportunity after the new charges were read.
the crown asserts that the interview was voluntary, preceded by a
“fresh start,” and that police acted in good faith throughout. if a breach is
found, it submits that the statement should still be admitted under section
24(2), given the minimal impact on
charter
-protected interests and
society’s strong interest in adjudicating serious charges on their merits.
the crown submits that the statement was voluntary. it argues that
the interview was conversational rather than oppressive and that mr. laguerre
demonstrated a clear operating mind throughout. it points to his ability to
understand and respond thoughtfully, correct himself when uncertain, and
decline further legal consultation when offered a second opportunity. the crown
emphasizes that there were no threats, promises, or trickery and that he was
reminded of his right to silence before substantive questioning began. it
characterizes the interview as a “fresh start” and maintains that voluntariness
is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
a.
admissibility of mr. laguerre’s statement: voluntariness and
charter
rights
the purpose of section 10(a) is to ensure that a person generally
understands the jeopardy they face. this right serves two main functions.
first, it protects individual liberty by guaranteeing that a person is not
required to submit to an arrest or detention without knowing the reasons for
it. second, it supports the right to counsel because an individual can only
exercise that right meaningfully if they understand the extent of their
jeopardy. to comply with section 10(a), the police must clearly communicate the
reason or reasons for the detention and must do so promptly. these requirements
are referred to as the informational and temporal components of section 10(a).
the 10(a) informational component requires police to tell the
detainee, in clear and simple language, the reason for the detention. if there are
multiple reasons, each must be disclosed, and they must be legally valid. these
reasons do not need to be expressed in technical or precise language but must
in substance inform the person the reason why they are being restrained.
the ultimate question is whether, in all the circumstances, the
explanation was sufficient for the detainee to make an informed choice about
submitting to the detention and exercising the right to counsel.
under section 10(b) of the
charter
,
further informational and
implementational rights exists
.
police have a duty to inform a detainee
of his or her right to retain and instruct counsel, and a duty to facilitate
that right immediately upon detention. suspensions of s. 10(b) will be lawful
where there are a) concerns for officer and public safety, b) where a limit on
the relevant right is prescribed by law and justified under
s. 1
of the
charter
,
or c) other exceptional circumstances.
since
there are no a) “exceptional circumstances” or a b) “suspension prescribed by law”
in this case—the issue is whether any suspension was justified due to c)
“officer or public safety concerns.”
i.
informational components under s.10(a) and 10(b)
prior to mr. laguerre’s booking
i accept the officers’ evidence that mr. laguerre’s rights to
counsel, first in english and then in french, were delivered as soon as could
be reasonably expected in the circumstances.
at the time of his detention, the scene was not secure. there were
unknowns about officer safety, public safety, and the protection of alleged
victims. officers were also receiving updates about possible human trafficking.
viewed as a whole, the officers acted promptly and provided those rights at the
first practical opportunity, as required by the
charter
. when mr.
laguerre asked for his rights in french, this was accommodated promptly because
a french-speaking officer was available.
i further find mr. laguerre was sufficiently informed what he was
being detained for when he asked sergeant bennewitz what this was about. this
happened within seconds of his detention. sgt. bennewitz explained it was
relating to an allegation of an assault and was quickly informed of the
additional allegation for breaching an undertaking when that was known to
police.
any delay before constable hunt completed advising mr. laguerre of
his rights in french caused no meaningful prejudice—especially considering the
crown is not seeking to lead his utterances in reply to bennewitz. the officers
respected his rights and refrained from questioning. to the extent there was a
brief suspension of section 10(b) rights, it was justified by concerns for
public and officer safety.
i also find
that it was not feasible for mr. laguerre to speak to counsel privately at the
scene or in the cruiser. returning him directly to the station was the most
appropriate course of action.
defence concedes there is no issue with the informational
sufficiency of the translated rights to counsel. mr. laguerre was informed of
his rights, including the availability of free duty counsel and the option to
contact a lawyer of his choosing. these rights were conveyed in accordance with
standard procedure and translated in real time by constable hunt.
mr. laguerre was not advised that he was being detained for human
trafficking at the time of his initial detention, during his first caution, or
at booking. however, i find this was entirely reasonable. the officers were
responding to a 911 call about an assault, not human trafficking. their
immediate focus was on securing the scene, ensuring safety, and addressing the
complaint of violence. a cpic check revealed a breach of undertaking, which
justified arrest for those offences. alleging human trafficking required a
deeper investigation, specialized knowledge, and corroboration beyond the
preliminary information available at the scene.
while there were early indicators of human trafficking—such as the
911 call and on‑scene statements from k.l. and n.b. referencing escort
work—reasonable and probable grounds implicating mr. laguerre did not
crystallize until later that evening after n.b.’s video‑recorded
statement. those grounds were then reinforced by corroborative evidence,
including the seizure of cash from mr. laguerre, the absence of funds on the
complainants, indicia of drug use, sex paraphernalia, false identification
documents, and extended hotel stays.
the initial caution was comprehensive and delivered as soon as
reasonably possible. at that time, mr. laguerre’s detention related only to
assault and breach of an undertaking. the more serious human trafficking
allegations arose only after grounds crystallized and required further
investigation and corroboration before the scope of jeopardy could properly
expand.
ii.
implementational component prior to mr. laguerre’s
booking
i accept the officers’ evidence that they acted in good faith in
explaining why mr. laguerre could not speak to counsel until his return to 12
division. their explanation that a conversation in the rear of the police
cruiser would not have been sufficiently private for legal advice, given the
presence of recording equipment and people nearby, is reasonable.
i also accept the officers’ evidence that, from the time of
detention until his rights were read in the police car, the scene was not
secure. there were unknowns, including whether mr. laguerre was armed, until a
search was completed. officers were also receiving updates about possible human
trafficking. in these circumstances, deferring implementation of the right to
counsel until a controlled environment was available was practical and
reasonable.
the time from det
ention to the delivery
of rights to counsel
was minimal. during transport, nothing of significance occurred and there was
no attempt to delay. constable couce confirmed only mr. laguerre’s name and
advised
that he could s
peak to his lawyer at the station. t
he route was direct,
with
mileage logged before and after. there were no threats, promises,
inducements, or oppressive circumstances. body-worn camera footage, though
blurred in parts for privacy, confirms respectful handling, including
assistance when exiting the vehicle.
some delay in providing access to counsel may be justified but the
burden is on the crown to show that the delay in the circumstances was
reasonable.
i find the crown has met that burden in the circumstances. the
focus was to ensure mr. laguerre could speak to his counsel in private, there
were public and police safety concerns, there was a possibility of a third
party (“julian”) attending the scene to cause harm to the witnesses, the
request for a specific counsel out of quebec would require some investigation
to find him, and the delay was as minimal as possible in achieving these ends
by taking him to the 12 division to speak to counsel there.
in the transport, any questions asked, such as whether he was on a
methadone program, required medication, or had injuries, were directed solely
to his health and well-being and not for investigative purposes. the inquiry
about methadone was a standard pre-caution to ensure necessary medication. any
answers he made are without any prejudice as the crown is not seeking to lead
them. arrangements were made to accommodate his booking, demonstrating an
active and good faith effort to address mr. laguerre promptly and enable him to
exercise his right to counsel.
for ease of reference, the total time from mr. laguerre’s initial
detention at approximately 16:48 to the completion of his rights to counsel in
french at 16:57 was about nine minutes. he was then transported immediately to
12 division, arriving at 17:17, and spoke to duty counsel at 17:33 following
booking. in total, the time from detention to contact with duty counsel was
approximately thirty
‑
nine minutes.
iii.
the booking of mr. laguerre and the deliberate
disabling of audio
constable couce testified that upon entering the booking area at 12
division, he was directed by the booking officers that the staff sergeant required
him to disable the audio on his body-worn camera. he complied and explained
that such directions vary among supervisors.
although video recording continued through cctv, the absence of
audio created a significant evidentiary gap. this gap complicates the
assessment of whether mr. laguerre’s rights were properly implemented and
whether any influence occurred that undermined his right to counsel or his
language of choice.
the right to counsel is foundational, and deficiencies in its
implementation can taint an entire investigation and any resulting statements.
an inaudible gap during a critical stage creates substantial challenges in
determining whether rights were properly afforded or undermined. if allegations
of threats, promises, or inducements arise, the absence of an audible record
makes such claims difficult to evaluate. there is no reasonable justification
for this gap.
the booking process is a critical stage in a custodial
investigation. at this point, an accused’s ability to exercise constitutional
rights is vulnerable, making transparency essential to ensure fairness. the
decision to disable audio warrants scrutiny.
the rationale expressed in
r. v. moore-mcfarlane
underscores
the importance of a reliable record, particularly where recording facilities
are available, and avoidance is deliberate. the ontario court of appeal stated:
“that onus may
be readily satisfied by the use of audio, or better still, video recording.
indeed, it is my view that where the suspect is in custody, recording
facilities are readily available, and the police deliberately set out to
interrogate the suspect without giving any thought to the making of a reliable
record, the context inevitably makes the resulting non-recorded interrogation
suspect. in such cases, it will be a matter for the trial judge on the
voir
dire
to determine whether or not a sufficient substitute for an audio or
videotape record has been provided to satisfy the heavy onus on the crown to
prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt”
.
while the events in the booking area may not constitute an
interrogation in the strict sense contemplated by
moore-mcfarlane
, the
underlying principles remain applicable when a deliberate decision is made to
disable an audible record of critical evidence. the need for a reliable record
is especially pronounced when the booking process directly engages the
accused’s right to counsel, language of choice, and the voluntariness of any
subsequent statements.
iv.
the impact of disabling the audio of the booking
and necessary scrutiny:
although the change of jeopardy breach, discussed below, renders the
video statement inadmissible, the circumstances surrounding the change in
counsel is concerning. the absence of an audible record compromised the
integrity of the evidence on the right to counsel and silence up to this point,
which had otherwise completely transparent with the benefit of body-worn
cameras.
while i found constable couce to be forthright and credible, his
account of how the change in counsel and language occurred remains unclear. he
testified that, upon booking at 12 division, mr. laguerre asked to speak with
patrick boulis, a french-speaking lawyer in quebec.
constable couce began searching for contact information for that
lawyer on his phone while mr. laguerre was seated on a bench. he identified
this moment on the cctv footage, which is consistent with his testimony. during
this time, the staff sergeant was speaking with mr. laguerre independently of
couce’s actions. given that couce was engaged in locating mr. boulis, it is
unsurprising that his memory of the conversation was vague. the vague exchange
described by couce must be assessed in the context of the cctv footage.
although couce could provide only limited assistance about the
details of the conversation, the cctv footage he authenticated captured this
exchange without audio and at a distance, as the camera was mounted above them.
constable couce stated that he was told by the staff sergeant that
mr. laguerre now wished to speak with english-speaking duty counsel. couce then
put his phone away to make that call. i accept his evidence that it was not his
role to question the change, but that principle only applies if the choice was
mr. laguerre’s own and fully informed. couce testified that he did not suggest
duty counsel and understood his role to be contacting whichever lawyer mr.
laguerre requested.
the staff sergeant and the booking officer did not testify.
a change from a specific lawyer to duty counsel is significant. even
a brief comment suggesting difficulty in reaching the requested lawyer could
influence that decision. without audio, i am left only with couce’s account of
the outcome: that mr. laguerre now wished to speak to duty counsel.
something
changed mr. laguerre’s choice
from insisting on a specific french-speaking lawyer at the hotel to accepting
english-speaking duty counsel at 12 division. the difficulty lies in
determining
what
triggered that change.
the footage shows that the interaction between the staff sergeant
and mr. laguerre was more than a spontaneous declaration. there was
back-and-forth discussion. mr. laguerre appears animated and, at times,
frustrated. because there is no audio, the court cannot determine what was said
or whether anything in that conversation influenced the change. this omission
is significant given the centrality of the right to counsel in the analysis
that follows.
constable couce testified that he did not mention duty counsel to
mr. laguerre during booking. any reference to duty counsel must therefore have
come from the staff sergeant. at that stage, the only focus should have been on
the counsel of choice already expressed. introducing duty counsel raises an
inference of possible influence toward selecting duty counsel over counsel of
choice. while this does not mean the staff sergeant should have avoided
mentioning the option altogether, in the context of a sudden change and
potential influence, the inference cannot be ignored.
considering all the above, and the common-sense conclusion that mr.
laguerre would have preferred to speak to his lawyer of choice in his native
french rather than an english-speaking duty counsel he did not know, i find on
a balance of probabilities that the change would not have occurred without some
degree of influence, whether inadvertent or not, from the staff sergeant.
the booking room is a location where audio recording should
ordinarily occur. when this is not possible, or a good faith mistake is made,
or other circumstances justify it, the omission may be excused. that is not the
case here. the discretion exercised by the staff sergeant resulted in a gap
that has generated extensive litigation. this omission has led to significant
expenditure of court time and resources to resolve issues that could have been
easily clarified had audio been available. the absence of a complete record has
frustrated the court’s ability to assess what was said and done, particularly
in relation to the accused’s right to counsel and the voluntariness of any
subsequent statements.
in my view, this practice should change.
it is
commendable that officers wear body-worn cameras, which provide significant
benefits to investigations, counsel, and the court. however, it makes little
sense to have near-complete transparency up to the booking of an accused,
followed by an intentional gap during booking directed by a superior officer,
and then a return to transparency thereafter.
as an example of the importance of transparency—and not as a factual
finding on what the specific policy may be—in interactions with an accused,
sergeant bennewitz testified that peel regional police policy now requires
body-worn cameras to remain active throughout police interactions with the
accused or members of the public, subject only to rare and clearly justified
exceptions. he stated, “now, i understand the policy is they want the camera on
all the time. very few instances you can turn it off. now they would like it
on,” and “i became aware this year of this. at first, i was an older officer
who was resistant, but now i understand it needs to be on all the time.” he
described this expectation of continuous recording as important. this reflects
the basic and fundamental principle that transparency should be maintained
during critical stages of police investigations when available.
transparency during critical stages of police investigations is
essential to ensuring fairness and facilitating judicial scrutiny, particularly
where an accused’s rights to counsel, language of choice, and voluntariness are
engaged. the mechanisms by which transparency is preserved may vary depending
on the circumstances, including body-worn camera footage, video statements, or
booking room recordings with audio. while full transparency may not always be
possible, where it is available and a deliberate decision is made to disable or
avoid it, that choice will likely attract judicial scrutiny and may affect the
weight given to the resulting evidence.
influence may be subtle, and claims of impropriety are easily made.
where transparency does not compete with operational considerations such as
officer safety, police assume a significant risk when they choose to compromise
it. transparency preserves court resources, assists the crown in proving
voluntariness, and enables defence counsel to advise clients effectively on
potential
charter
breaches. as a matter of practice, it also places
police in a stronger position when seemingly minor allegations evolve into
serious ones, as occurred in this case.
v.
the breach of rights to counsel and
voluntariness up to the booking room
it is more probable than not that mr. laguerre did not waive his
right to counsel of choice or his language rights. had mr. boulis been available
by phone, it is improbable that mr. laguerre would have chosen duty counsel
instead. a complete evidentiary record would have resolved this issue; in its
absence, i must reach my conclusion on what i find to be the more probable
explanation.
as it relates to voluntariness, i find that no threats, promises,
inducements, or other improper conduct occurred up to the moment mr. laguerre
entered the interview room. he had an operating mind and was acting
voluntarily. he was also aware of his right to silence in clear terms that he
understood.
b.
mr. laguerre’s change in jeopardy to human trafficking offences and
delay in advising him of the new charges.
section 10(a) requires police to promptly inform a person, in clear
and simple language, of the legally valid reason for their detention. its
purpose is to ensure the person understands the jeopardy they face so they can
decide whether to submit to the detention and exercise their right to counsel
meaningfully. this obligation concerns what is being investigated, not the
investigative steps that may follow. however, because a detainee will not
appreciate what investigative steps might ensue or how those steps could
incriminate them despite their right to silence, it is all the more important
that they receive their right to counsel and the ability to obtain that advice
without delay. this is particularly critical when an investigation is already
underway in relation to offences for which a change in jeopardy has occurred.
knowledge of the purpose of the detention is so important to the
informed exercise of the right to counsel that the police are constitutionally
required by
s. 10(a)
of the
charter
to promptly inform a detained person
of the reasons for her detention. where there is more than one reason for a detention,
they must all be disclosed. "jeopardy" in this context includes the
detained person's risk of self-incrimination. that risk cannot be measured
without knowledge of the reason for the detention and the subject matter of the
police inquiries. an individual can only exercise his s. 10(b) right in a
meaningful way if he knows the extent of his jeopardy and be advised on what
sort of investigative steps may be taken so they can evaluate the risk for
self-incrimination and make choices based upon that information.
section 10(b)
of the
charter
states that upon arrest or
detention, everyone has the right to "retain and instruct counsel without
delay and to be informed of that right". its purpose is "to support
the detainee's right to choose whether to cooperate with the police investigation
or not, by giving him access to legal advice on the situation he is facing.
this is achieved by requiring that he be informed of the right to consult
counsel and, if he so requests, be given an opportunity to consult
counsel".
police must advise the accused of his or her right to counsel a
second time when new circumstances arise indicating that the accused is a
suspect for a different, more serious crime than was the case at the time of
the first warning.
this can arise out of several contextual factors, including a new
charge that significantly increases moral blameworthiness and potential
consequences constitutes a change in jeopardy, even if arising from the same
facts.
a detainee’s request to reconsult standing alone is insufficient. "what
is required is a change in circumstances that suggests that the choice face by
the accused has been significantly altered, requiring further advice on the new
situation, in order to fulfill the purpose of s. 10(b) of providing the accused
with legal advice relevant to the choice of whether to cooperate with the
police investigation or not"
a lack of awareness of investigative steps does not, by itself,
amount to a change in jeopardy. for example, where further steps are
foreseeable in relation to the same charge, no new jeopardy arises.
i.
when the change of jeopardy occurred
while mr. laguerre was in police custody in the cruiser, body-worn
camera footage captured officers bolarinho, couce, bennewitz, and thurston
discussing the investigation. officer hunt made inquiries over the radio in
french regarding a possible human trafficking angle. as previously found,
reasonable grounds for mr. laguerre’s arrest on human trafficking charges, and
therefore the change in his jeopardy, did not arise until n.b. completed her
statement describing the offences allegedly committed by mr. laguerre.
detective constable douglas conducted himself professionally and
treated mr. laguerre with respect and dignity. he did not make threats,
inducements, or promises. however, the practice of obtaining information under
the guise of “intake” or “identification” extended beyond what was legally
required to confirm mr. laguerre’s identity for the purposes of detention and
release. any questioning beyond that, whether inadvertent or not, amounted to
evidence and intelligence gathering. this related not only to the allegations
mr. laguerre was facing but also to other investigations of interest to the
vice unit of the peel regional police.
the right to counsel assumes heightened importance when an accused
faces a change in jeopardy. this principle is well established in law. police
procedures that diminish the significance of this right cannot be tolerated,
whether by design or by practice. the value of legal advice is directly tied to
the nature of the charges and the seriousness of the jeopardy at the time the
advice is given. competent legal counsel does not offer generic advice to
remain silent in all circumstances. rather, legal advice is tailored, nuanced,
and responsive to the specific allegations and practical realities of the case.
it is the role of counsel to ensure that a detainee is advised of investigatory
steps that police may take and how the detainee might incriminate himself in
the process.
in this case, the change in jeopardy was severe. mr. laguerre was
initially arrested for common assault and breach of undertaking. these are
offences typically prosecuted summarily and often result in non-custodial
outcomes. even if prosecuted by indictment, the maximum penalties are five
years for assault and two years for breach of undertaking, with no mandatory
minimums. as a practical matter, these charges generally attract legal advice
focused on immediate release, bail considerations, and basic procedural rights.
once the human trafficking allegations were introduced, the legal
landscape shifted entirely. the new charges included human trafficking under
the
criminal code
, which carry maximum sentences of fourteen years or
life imprisonment and mandatory minimums of four to five years. additional
charges such as receiving a material benefit from trafficking, advertising
sexual services, and exercising control over others under the
section 286
series further elevated the seriousness of the case. these offences are
associated with organized exploitation and carry significant custodial
consequences. they place an accused well within the range of mid-level
penitentiary sentences, even in the absence of aggravating factors. proper
legal advice on these types of charges would extend well beyond that required
of assault and breaching an undertaking. such advice would focus on the
seriousness of the allegations, the way these offences are investigated, the
likelihood of warrants and a police interview with a specialized unit, the
impact of minor admissions (such as phone numbers or email addresses), and improbability
of release from police custody.
when a change in jeopardy becomes apparent, as it did here, it is
not for police to assess whether earlier legal advice remains sufficient. that assessment
belongs solely to counsel, and the
charter
protects it accordingly.
similarly, apart from the basic identification required to determine who is
under arrest or detention, police cannot redefine portions of an interview as
administrative intake in a manner that exempts them from constitutional
scrutiny or the rules governing voluntariness—particularly when that evidence
is then used in the prosecution and not treated as compelled admissions.
police officers understand that even seemingly routine information,
such as a phone number or social media handle, can be incriminating or serve as
a gateway to further investigative steps that would otherwise require judicial
authorization. without the benefit of legal advice or a clear understanding
that such information may be withheld, an accused is unlikely to appreciate the
consequences of disclosure. experienced counsel would take these considerations
into account and provide advice tailored to the seriousness of the situation.
similarly, such questioning cannot be justified based on efficiency
or “going with the flow,” as detective constable douglas testified. the right
to counsel is a principle of fundamental justice and reflects a commitment to
the fair treatment of persons detained by the police, even at the expense of
investigative efficiency.
while police are entitled and encouraged to pursue probative
evidence and investigative leads, including intelligence for other cases, these
efforts must be conducted in a manner that respects constitutional rights and
adheres to the common law principles of voluntariness.
ii.
the investigative and prosecutorial value to mr.
laguerre’s admissions
before mr. laguerre was re-cautioned regarding his right to silence
and right to counsel in relation to the significantly more serious human
trafficking charges, detective constable douglas obtained a wide range of
personal and potentially incriminating information. this was presented as part
of an administrative intake process. mr. laguerre disclosed his full name, date
of birth, gender, racial origin, home address in montreal, phone number
associated with the seized device, and immigration status, including that he
was a former permanent resident awaiting a court decision. he also provided
details about his employment as a mechanic for a friend’s rental company,
denied having an email or social media accounts, and described his physical
characteristics, including height, weight, hair and eye colour, tattoos, and
handedness.
it is worth noting that by the time the interview commenced, police
already possessed sufficient information to process mr. laguerre, including his
identity and health. this information had been obtained through constable couce
during the booking and transport stages. accordingly, the questions posed by
detective constable douglas at the outset of the interview were not
administratively necessary. i find that the purpose of the questions was
investigatory, directed toward eliciting information relevant to the more
serious offences under investigation, and all of this occurred prior to the re-caution.
following the re-caution, which i have found deficient, mr. laguerre
stated that he had travelled from montreal to mississauga three days earlier,
that he was staying with a friend rather than at the hotel with the
complainants, and that he had sold a honda civic for $4,500 earlier that day,
which he claimed explained the large amount of cash found on his person. he
also confirmed that the seized phone was not his current device. although these
disclosures were framed as routine identification, they extended well beyond
what was necessary for administrative processing and entered the realm of
evidence gathering. this is particularly concerning given the seriousness of
the investigation and the evolving nature of the allegations.
there are several aspects of this information that are
incriminating, particularly mr. laguerre’s admission that the phone number
associated with the online posting for escort services was his, and that
clients would need to contact him to arrange meetings for sexual services. if
admitted, this constitutes strong inferential evidence of awareness, control,
and receipt of material benefit as charged. in addition, much of this
information, if admitted, could be used to support the crown’s application to
admit hearsay statements by bolstering threshold reliability. the nuance and
complexity of how this evidence is both detrimental and self-incriminating
underscores the importance of mr. laguerre’s rights under
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
in these circumstances.
i am aware of the authority stating that “an answer to an innocuous
question asked for a different purpose may prove to be useful to the crown does
not change the character of the questioning.”
however, that
principle does not assist here. first, the questions put to mr. laguerre were
not innocuous. they were directed to specifics of this investigation and,
arguably, to a broader human
‑
trafficking inquiry. these were designed to elicit incriminating
information. the questions went beyond what might be considered for the
“purpose of completing the record of arrest”.
it is
also worth noting as a relevant factor that this incriminating information
obtained from mr. laguerre, was not known to police.
while officers may, in some limited circumstances, ask for basic identifying
or questions necessary for booking
or urgent
health and safety of the detainee or others
,
there is always a risk that such information will later be found involuntary or
obtained in breach of
sections 10(a)
or
10(b)
of the
charter
. if true
exigent concerns justify the questioning, the trade‑off is that those
utterances run the risk of being excluded under a 24(2) evaluation where the
intent and good faith of officers can be evaluated.
the difficulty with retroactively labeling questions as “innocuous”
is that, by the nature of exclusion applications, no utterance is truly
innocuous. all answers are potentially incriminating. assessing their character
only after they become probative imports an artificial test based on hindsight.
if officers testify that incrimination was not their intent, that may bear on
the section 24(2) analysis under good faith—but it does not negate the
existence of a breach.
such exceptions create a real potential for abuse when investigatory
questions are deliberately front
‑
loaded under the guise of
“booking,” “health and safety,” or “innocuous” inquiries, knowing that the
answers will advance the investigation. a common example is asking for phone
numbers, social media accounts, or other details that can trigger search
warrants or link an accused to incriminating communications. a single admission
of this kind may be fatal to a defence. without the benefit of legal advice to
understand these implications, such questioning is entirely at odds with the
purpose and value of the rights guaranteed by sections 10(a) and 10(b). this
risk is further exacerbated when such questions are presented as necessary for
booking or pre
‑
interview purposes (a fact i find in this case), creating the
impression that they are administratively required for processing and/or
release.
detective constable douglas, although attempting to follow the
natural flow of the interview, acknowledged that he was aware of the change in
jeopardy. nevertheless, he chose to provide the caution only after obtaining
information that was both helpful and incriminating to the investigation. it
also likely served as valuable intelligence for further investigations. at
best, he was indifferent as to the consequences of potentially incriminating
information provided by mr. laguerre and waded into constitutionally dangerous areas
of questioning.
detective constable douglas testified,
“obviously
seeing his jeopardy has changed, i gave him his rights to counsel.”
however, this occurred only after the officer completed the intake
form and elicited the information he sought from the accused. recording
incriminating answers on a form does not lessen their seriousness. if anything,
it reinforces the impression that the accused was compelled to provide the
information as part of routine paperwork, creating a systemic exception to
constitutional protection that lacks statutory authority. this impression, that
i find happened here, materially impaired mr. laguerre’s ability to exercise
his right to counsel meaningfully. officer douglas agreed on cross
‑
examination that the accused was not required to answer the
questions or provide the information.
iii.
the re-caution on right to silence and right to
counsel
in the re-caution, detective constable douglas began by advising mr.
laguerre of the new charges he was facing. he confirmed that mr. laguerre had
previously spoken to a lawyer. douglas then stated:
“you’re
not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may
be given in evidence against you. you understand?”
mr. laguerre
responded affirmatively. douglas continued:
“if you
have spoken to any police officer or to anyone with the authority or if any
such person has spoken to you in connection with this case, i want you to
understand that i don’t want you to influence. so if you’ve spoken to an
officer in regards to this matter, i don’t want to influence our conversation
that we have.”
mr. laguerre
again indicated understanding. douglas emphasized,
“whatever
you say is basically voluntary on you. i am not forcing you to say anything
that you don’t wanna say.”
mr. laguerre
confirmed his understanding. douglas then asked;
“would you
like to speak to your lawyer about the new charges, or… do you understand?”
mr. laguerre
replied,
“no, i’m
good.”
douglas
confirmed,
“you good?”
mr. laguerre
responded:
“i’m good.”
the re-caution administered by detective constable douglas consisted
of two distinct elements. the first related to the right to silence and the
voluntariness of any statement made. the second concerned the accused’s rights
under
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
, specifically the
informational and implementational requirements associated with the right to
counsel.
with respect to the first element, i am satisfied that the officer
fulfilled his obligations. from that point forward, the statement was voluntary
under the common law. mr. laguerre was informed of his right to silence,
advised of the charges he was facing, and was free from threats, inducements,
or promises. he was also operating with an active and informed mind on his
right to silence.
i further find that language posed no barrier for mr. laguerre
despite his first language being french. he understood the questions and
responded with ease. at no point did it appear that he was unaware of what was
being asked or that he struggled to answer in english. i find that it was his
voluntary choice to proceed in english without the need or request for an
interpreter.
while i am satisfied that the statement was voluntary at common law
from the point of the re-caution onward, the required informational and
implementational components relating to mr. laguerre’s right to counsel
persisted.
with respect to this second element, i find the re-caution
deficient. both the informational and implementational duties were lacking. the
officer did not adequately communicate the minimum standards required under
section 10(b), nor did he ensure that the accused was provided a meaningful
opportunity to exercise that right. this deficiency is further compounded by my
earlier finding that mr. laguerre’s right to counsel of choice, namely mr.
boulis, was not respected prior to the commencement of the interview.
put simply, had detective constable douglas properly re-cautioned
mr. laguerre on his rights under sections 10(a) and 10(b) at the outset of the
statement, i would have no difficulty finding the statement admissible under
the “fresh start” principle.
without that, i find the opposite. the later caution did not
attenuate the breach because it occurred after incriminating information was
obtained, failed to address the change in jeopardy, and did not provide a
meaningful opportunity to consult counsel. a proper re-caution also would have
helped reconcile the issue of what mr. laguerre’s intentions were when the
audio was unavailable in the booking room and he switched from counsel of
choice to duty counsel, as explained above.
the “fresh start” doctrine is only applicable when premised upon
charter
compliance in the re-caution. that did not happen here as it relates to
section 10(b).  even if i am wrong in this respect, i find that the initial
non-compliance where mr. laguerre’s change of jeopardy was not properly advised
tainted the entirety of the statement by starting a flow of information that
could not be walked back. i therefore find that even following the inadequate
re-caution the evidence was obtained in a manner with a sufficient causal,
temporal, or contextual connection between the
charter
breach and the
impugned evidence to render any recaution (whether adequate or not) as fruitless
at this point.
c.
the exclusion of the video statement of mr. laguerre under s.24(2)
of the
charter of rights and freedoms
while the public has a strong interest in adjudicating serious
criminal charges on their merits, this interest must not override other
fundamental considerations
. in this case, the impugned conduct was serious and had a
substantial impact on mr. laguerre’s
charter
rights, including his right
to silence and his right to legal counsel capable of advising him on the
implications of providing information.
section 24(2) is concerned with preserving the long-term integrity
of, and public confidence in, the justice system. its purpose is not to punish
police misconduct or compensate the accused, but to address systemic and
institutional concerns. the analysis engages three lines of inquiry: the
seriousness of the
charter
-infringing conduct, the impact of the breach
on the accused’s protected interests, and society’s interest in adjudicating
the case on its merits. the balancing of these factors is qualitative and not
subject to mathematical precision.
i.
the first
grant
factor: the seriousness
of state conduct
the first
grant
factor requires consideration of the
seriousness of the state conduct. the court must situate the impugned conduct
on a spectrum of culpability. the more serious the state misconduct, the
greater the need to protect the long-term repute of the administration of
justice by disassociating the court’s processes from that misconduct.
i am also obligated to consider the cumulative seriousness of the
charter
breaches.
although detective constable douglas treated mr. laguerre with
respect, i do not accept that the failure to re-caution him earlier was an
oversight. nor was “going with the flow” a legally justifiable approach. the
officer was aware that mr. laguerre’s jeopardy had changed, and that the
information being elicited under the guise of intake was likely to yield
probative evidence. this included corroborative links to leolist postings, and
the statements provided by k.l. and n.b.
i find that this inquiry was driven by a deliberate approach taken
by the vice unit to gather information about a suspected human trafficker prior
to administering a caution. the intake form used by detective constable douglas
was prepared in advance, and the list of charges that mr. laguerre noticed and
asked about was also ready before the re-caution. there was a choice made—or as
i find, an intended sequence—by the vice unit to proceed with the form first,
anticipating that such information might not be as easily obtained once the
accused had been properly advised of his rights and had the benefit of legal
counsel.
detective constable douglas’ admission that a change in jeopardy had
taken place and proceeded in this order demonstrates that the breach was
deliberate, even if there was an attempt to mitigate it by the re-caution.
this reflects a systemic and serious issue that, whether by design
or intent, disregarded the detainee’s right to counsel and his right to be
promptly informed of the reasons for detention. it occurred as an independent
breach to the preceding one in the booking room, and not as a consequential
inevitability. unlike cases where good faith mitigates seriousness, the conduct
here was deliberate and systemic. this compounded the seriousness of the state
misconduct and the impact it had upon the accused.
ii.
the second
grant
factor: the impact of
the
charter
infringement upon the accused’s interests
the second
grant
factor examines the impact on
charter
-protected
interests. in this case, the impact on mr. laguerre’s
charter
-protected
interests was significant. he made several incriminating admissions both before
and after the deficient re-caution. these included, most notably, the phone
number associated with the leolist advertisements, which corroborates the
complainants’ allegations that he exercised control over them, posted ads, and
received material benefits.
prior to the re-caution, mr. laguerre disclosed his middle name
“marc,” occupation, physical descriptors, immigration status, and phone number.
these admissions have the potential to incriminate him by linking him to the
complainants’ narrative and by undermining his credibility should he testify.
following the re-caution, mr. laguerre admitted to travelling from
montreal with the complainants, staying with a friend, selling a vehicle for
$4,500, and denied involvement in escort services or control over the
complainants. he also acknowledged prior convictions for similar offences.
these admissions carry similar risks of self-incrimination and corroboration.
iii.
the third
grant
factor: the societal
interest in trying cases on their merits
the third grant inquiry typically points toward admission because
society has a strong interest in adjudicating cases on their merits. however,
this factor is not determinative. even where the first two inquiries do not
both pull with equal force, a serious
charter
breach coupled with a
significant or even moderate impact on protected interests can justify
exclusion. when the first two inquiries together make a strong case for
exclusion, the third inquiry “will seldom if ever tip the balance in favour of
admissibility”
in assessing society’s interest, courts must look beyond the
immediate reliability of the evidence and consider the long-term repute of the
justice system. disrepute may result from excluding relevant evidence, but it
may equally result from admitting evidence obtained through conduct that
undermines constitutional norms or amounts to judicial condonation of
unacceptable practices.
an adjudication on the merits presupposes a respect for and
adherence to fundamental rights. canadians have a legitimate expectation that
police will know and comply with the law, including the
charter
, even in
dynamic situations. this expectation is central to maintaining public
confidence in the administration of justice.
iv.
grant
factors
applied results in exclusion
the first and second factors strongly favor exclusion; the third
favors inclusion. balancing these factors qualitatively, i conclude that
exclusion is required to maintain public confidence in the administration of
justice.
this is conduct from which the court must dissociate itself. it had
a serious impact on the accused’s interests, and despite society’s interest in
deciding cases on their merits (the third
grant
factor) admitting this
evidence would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
given the cumulative seriousness of the breaches and their impact,
exclusion is necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of
justice pursuant to
section 24(2)
of the
charter
.
part iv: the
admissibility of the hearsay utterances of k.l. and n.b.
a.
an overview of the hearsay application and the legal principles:
the crown seeks to introduce several out-of-court statements made by
the complainants, including:
(a) the 911
call placed by the complainant referred to as k.l.;
(c) various
utterances made by both complainants captured on body-worn camera; and,
(c) the
video-recorded statement of the complainant referred to as n.b.;
(d) other
evidence obtained during the investigation into mr. laguerre.
these out-of-court utterances and statements are presumptively
inadmissible as they are hearsay. the crown seeks their admission on the
principled approach to hearsay, as well as some of the utterances under the
res
gestae
exception.
the
res gestae
exception relates to those utterances that, generally,
are those to describe a statement of present physical condition, statements of
present mental state, and excited utterances.
under the principled approach, the party seeking their admission
must meet a threshold of necessity and reliability. as the trial judge, i am
required to act as gatekeeper in determining whether these criteria are met. necessity
is generally satisfied where the declarant is unavailable to testify despite
reasonable efforts to secure their attendance.
threshold reliability is assessed through the interplay of
procedural and substantive safeguards. the court must determine whether
adequate substitutes exist for the testing mechanisms typically available at
trial, such that the trier of fact may properly evaluate the evidence.
the concern of reliability in hearsay derives from the fact that
this type of evidence is not subject to the usual scrutiny and testing that
cross-examination may afford and may undermine the court’s “truth-seeking
function”.
these dangers affecting reliability arise from the absence of contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant
under oath before the trier of fact and the difficulty of assessing the
declarant’s perception, memory, narration, or sincerity.
in assessing threshold reliability, the trial judge must identify
the specific hearsay dangers presented by the statement and consider any means
of overcoming them. the dangers relate to the difficulties of assessing the
declarant's perception, memory, narration, or sincerity, and should be defined
with precision to permit a realistic evaluation of whether they have been
overcome.
even where necessity and reliability are established, the court
retains a residual discretion to exclude the evidence if its prejudicial effect
outweighs its probative value.
b.
the evidence relating to the hearsay application
as noted, the evidentiary record on pre-trial motions proceeded in a
blended fashion. all counsel agreed that evidence ruled admissible during
pre-trial motions would carry over to the trial, and that evidence from one
motion could be considered in another where appropriate.
this approach required care to avoid improper reliance on
inadmissible evidence across applications. in particular, and considering my
ruling on the accused’s video statement, i have not considered any portion of
that statement in assessing the hearsay application. nor have i considered any
utterances made by the accused while detained or made to a person in authority,
as the crown did not seek their admission for this purpose. this exclusion does
not apply to utterances outside of those protections where the
charter
and
principles of voluntariness would not, respectively, apply.
i have therefore carried over only admissible evidence from other
officers in considering the hearsay application below. this does not, however,
preclude consideration of utterances allegedly made by mr. laguerre where those
statements were not made to a person in authority and/or while detained and
subject to
charter
protections. in particular, the statements he allegedly
made to the complainants may be properly considered as part of the cumulative
record on the hearsay application with the need for proof of voluntariness
beyond a reasonable doubt.
for the sake of organization, i have isolated or bifurcated the
evidence of certain officers whose testimony relates primarily to the hearsay
application. this evidence is presented below to frame and amplify the issues
now alive for consideration. it is in addition to the admissible evidence
summarized earlier.
i.
the 911 call, the
res gestae
exception,
and considered reliability of the utterances made
the evidence regarding the 911 call is summarized above at
paragraphs 13-26.
the call demonstrates k.l. was emotionally distraught and provided a
detailed account of the events that had just occurred, including the location and
her relationship to the alleged assailant, wooldy laguerre. the caller’s
emotional state is best conveyed through the audio recording; any written
summary cannot fully capture the tone, urgency, and panic reflected in her
voice.
when police arrived, body‑worn camera footage corroborated the
emotional state heard in the 911 call, together with other factors such as
k.l.’s location, lack of belongings or money, and her state of dress.
the crown seeks to admit the 911 call under the traditional
res
gestae
exception to hearsay and under the principled approach.
as mentioned, the common law recognizes an exception to the hearsay
rule for spontaneous or excited utterances. a statement made while the
declarant is under the stress of a startling event may be admitted where the
circumstances sufficiently reduce the risk of fabrication. strict
contemporaneity with the event is not required, provided the stress persists
and there has been no opportunity for contrivance or misrepresentation.
although timing is relevant,
it is not determinative.
where these conditions are satisfied, the statement may meet the threshold of
reliability for admission.
in canada,
res gestae
exceptions include "excited
utterances," "statements of present physical condition," and
"statements of present mental state”;.
this spontaneity is presumed to convey a circumstantial guarantee of
trustworthiness.
in applying the principled approach, factors that may diminish
reliability must also be considered. these include the inability to cross‑examine
the declarant, any motive to fabricate, intoxication, and language barriers.
each of these factors is present and has been considered in this case.
conversely, factors that enhance reliability beyond the inherent
presumption under the
res gestae
standard must also be considered. these
include the accuracy of the recording, corroboration of the facts stated,
absence of any motive to fabricate, and the declarant’s awareness of the
importance of truthfulness and the potential consequences of falsehoods.
ii.
admissible elements of the 911 call:
in this case, i find that the 911 call was made soon after k.l. was
allegedly assaulted and threatened by mr. laguerre and the stress of the event
was ongoing.
the 911 call captures her highly elevated emotional state, her sense of panic,
and urgency in having police attend. this all enhances the reliability of the
utterances as it minimized an ability to concoct an elaborate version of
events.
the facts k.l. conveyed in the 911 call were as follows. she stated
that she was at a gas station connected to a super 8 hotel in mississauga,
specifically in room 408. she stated that her boyfriend had been hitting her,
punching her repeatedly, leaving her bruised, and had struck her with a cable
or phone charger. she stated that the assault had happened “just right now.”
k.l. identified her boyfriend as wooldy laguerre, approximately 31
to 32 years old, from quebec. she stated that she was wearing only a t-shirt,
had no pants, and did not have her phone because it had been taken by the
accused. she confirmed that she did not need an ambulance. she stated that
another female had been in the room and had sided against her. she explained
that she worked for mr. laguerre as an escort and had done so for about one and
a half years, and that the other female was also an escort who had been working
for him for the same period. she stated that her belongings, including her
phone, keys, and money, were in the hotel room. she advised that she was from
montreal and feared that mr. laguerre would leave with her belongings and
money.
she provided a description of mr. laguerre as a black male of
average height and heavy build, wearing a black t-shirt and black jeans. she
initially suspected that he was inside the gas station wearing a hoodie and
possibly hiding, but later corrected herself that it was not him. she gave
details of the vehicle he was driving: a grey honda civic with a quebec paper
plate in the rear window, parked in front of the hotel vestibule entry. she
admitted to using cocaine earlier in the day but stated that mr. laguerre had
not used drugs or alcohol. throughout the call, she expressed fear, urgency,
and concern about police delay. she asked about recovering money taken by her
boyfriend and explained that she had no family to contact and was worried about
returning to montreal.
while utterances made during 911 calls are often admitted under the
res gestae exception, their inclusion in such a call does not automatically
render them admissible under that exception. the court
must still exercise caution to ensure that each hearsay utterance(s) is
properly admissible under the
res gestae
exception, or under the
principled approach, and that it is not inadmissible for some other reason such
relevance or an outweighed prejudicial effect when compared to its potential
probative value.
the crown asks that the entirety of the 911 call and the alleged
facts uttered within to be entered under the
res gestae
exception(with
the exception of mr. laguerre’s drug and alcohol use); or, in the alternative,
all utterances and facts contained therein meeting the principled exception to
hearsay, principled exception to hearsay, and therefore all alleged facts
summarized above meet the threshold for admissibility at trial.
i intend to address the
res gestae
elements first and then,
if necessary, return to any remaining utterances under the principled approach.
in applying the
res gestae
exception, i find the following material
utterances meeting the traditional exception under the
res gestae
rule (as
explained above) as either "excited utterances," "statements of
present physical condition," or "statements of present mental state”
made with sufficient contemporaneity to the event described, and under
circumstances that minimize the unreliability of the utterances. i find them as
spontaneous statements made under the stress or pressure of a dramatic or
startling act or event and relating to such an occasion.
i also find the following
details were relayed in a spontaneous and unprompted manner where any concerns
for concoction are therefore sufficiently minimized to make them inherently
reliable:
•
k.l. identifies her boyfriend as wooldy
laguerre, age 31–32, from quebec. (pp.9, 12, 14)
•
k.l. states her boyfriend (wl) keeps hitting
her, punched her repeatedly, and left her bruised. (pp.3, 5, and 6)
•
k.l states he hit her with a cable/phone
charger. (p.5)
•
k.l. says the assault happened “just right
now”. (p.6)
•
k.l. is wearing only a t-shirt, no pants, and
has no phone (it was taken by the accused). (pp.3, 4, and 7)
•
there was another female in the room at the
time of the allegations. (p.6)
•
k.l.’s belongings, including phone, keys, and
money, are in the hotel room. (pp.7, 11, and 12)
•
that money was taken from her by mr. laguerre
and questions about how she is to recover it. (p.15)
•
k.l. advises she is from montreal as no
family to contact and is worried about returning to montreal. (pp. 11, 12, 17)
•
mr. laguerre is described as a black male,
average height, heavy build. wearing black t-shirt and black jeans. (p.9)
•
details of the vehicle mr. laguerre is
driving: grey honda civic, quebec paper plate in rear window and parked in
front of the entry of the hotel.(p.16)
•
k.l. expresses fear, urgency, and concern
about police delay. (pp.5, 13, 15, 17…)
•
k.l. admits to using cocaine earlier in the
day. (p.10)
•
k.l. fears mr. laguerre will leave with her
belongings and money. (pp.11-12)
with respect to the remaining utterances mentioned on the 911 call,
they will be analyzed under the “principled approach” as they do not fall
properly under the
res gestae
exception. depending on that principled
approach, analysis and other evidentiary rules, the following may or may not be
admissible.
•
the other female sided against k.l. in the
argument. (pp.6, 11)
•
k.l. works for mr. laguerre as an escort as
has been so for 1.5 years. (p.6, 7, 12)
•
the other female is also an escort.(p.7)
iii.
consideration of
res gestae
as it applies
to body-worn camera footage
at the conclusion of the 911 call, police arrived and k.l.’s
interactions were captured on body‑worn camera footage, creating a
seamless transition from audio to audio‑video recording. constable hunt’s
body‑worn camera activated at 16:41:15 as she approached k.l., who was
visibly distraught, partially unclothed, and injured.
under the circumstances, i have assessed whether any of the
utterances captured on body‑worn camera by k.l. or n.b. continue this
res
gestae
exception. i conclude that several factors take those utterances
outside this traditional exception explained above, and therefore require
analysis under the principled approach to determine their admissibility. i base
this conclusion on the following factors:
•
constable thurston was already speaking with
k.l., but her camera did not activate until 16:58:05, leaving the initial
interactions unrecorded.
•
hunt briefly left to retrieve a lighter, then
resumed contact at 16:43:38 and spoke with k.l. in french while constable thurston
remained with k.l. and without a body-worn camera recording.
•
while k.l.’s demeanor remained agitated, her
statements were now in response to investigative questions, including the cause
of her injuries and whether the assailant was her pimp, to which she agreed.
•
because these statements were elicited through
questioning, they cannot be considered spontaneous or fall within any
res
gestae
exception.
•
any utterances made by k.l. or n.b. captured on body-worn
camera must therefore be assessed entirely under the principled approach.
c.

d.
the principled “
bradshaw
” approach to hearsay applied to the body-worn
camera footage capturing the utterances of k.l. and n.b., and the 911 call.
i now address the remaining hearsay
under
the principled exception to hearsay. necessity is conceded. the issue is
threshold reliability. the crown therefore submits the
following hearsay is admissible under the principled exception:
the defence concedes relevance and necessity on material aspects.
•
k.l.’s 911 call.
•
body‑worn camera utterances of k.l. and
n.b.
•
in‑car camera utterances of n.b.
•
n.b.’s video‑recorded statement at 12
division.
•
in‑person utterances by k.l. to detective
constable brunino, october 12 and 13.
•
in‑person utterances by k.l. to detective
constable douglas, october 12 and 13.
•
text messages sent by k.l. to detective
constable douglas, october 16, 20, and 23.
•
statements describing present physical
condition, such as “i hurt everywhere".
the defence takes no issue with admission of statements of present
physical condition for the limited purpose of proving contemporaneous pain;
however, it does not concede the cause of that pain.
the crown submits that the statements and utterances of k.l. and
n.b. are supported by procedural and substantive reliability features
sufficient to meet threshold reliability.
in this assessment, i consider only evidence already ruled or
conceded admissible, including the further testimony of detective constable douglas
and the evidence of constable danielle dalton, who provided french
interpretation during n.b.’s interview.
mr. laguerre’s utterances and statement were excluded or not
tendered. i therefore do not take them into account in this assessment.
i.
(continued) evidence of detective constable kenaul
douglas (vice)
detective constable douglas was recalled to address corroboration
and reliability for the principled hearsay analysis. his role was to
consolidate digital and surveillance evidence, including fourth‑floor
super 8 cctv, device extractions, and leolist archives, in order to test the
material aspects of the complainants’ accounts on this
voir dire
.
the
hotel surveillance
on october 15–16, 2024, douglas tasked detective constable buczkowski
to retrieve motion‑activated clips from the hotel’s fourth‑floor
cameras. the system produced discrete segments rather than continuous
recording. douglas reviewed the footage, selected relevant segments, and
uploaded them to axon for disclosure.
detective constable douglas testified that the cctv displayed times
required conversion to real time. counsel agree that, during the relevant
period, the fourth‑floor hallway (4w), the elevator (e4), and the west
stairwell (west stair g) feeds each displayed times approximately thirty‑eight
minutes behind real time.
for accuracy, displayed times on the hallway and elevator feeds are
converted to real time by adding about thirty‑eight minutes
(approximately +00:38:15), and displayed times on the west stairwell feed are
converted by adding approximately +00:38:47. the precise synchronization method
and anchor points are reflected in
appendix b
with cross‑references to exhibits filed on the
voir dire
.
the surveillance corroborates that room 408 served as the base of
operations for the complainants with the accused present over multiple days and
shows regular client movements to and from that room. identification rests on
clothing, distinctive features, device handling, and continuity across clips.
on october 6, 2024, k.l. and n.b. are seen arriving and entering
room 408, followed minutes later by the accused carrying a large duffle bag.
later that evening, the three return together to the room.
on october 7, 2024, the three leave room 408 together; separate
clips that day show a male client entering and later departing, consistent with
commercial activity centered on 408.
on october 8, 2024, the accused is seen at the elevator handling two
phones, one with distinctive rear‑housing damage consistent with the
device later produced by k.l. as the “trap phone.”
on october 9, 2024, footage records the accused counting cash while
exiting room 408 and entering the elevator, with additional clips of the three
returning together and of clients arriving and departing around that period.
on october 10, 2024, clips show two clients entering room 408 and
later leaving with n.b., followed by another male arriving and departing; these
sequences reinforce the pattern of client traffic to and from the room.
on october 12, 2024, at approximately 16:07 real time, k.l. is seen
running from room 408 in a long black t‑shirt with no pants, heading
toward the stairwell. shortly thereafter, the accused exits 408; later clips
show him waiting outside the door with a paper bag and handling a phone before
returning. around 16:13, n.b. runs from 408 toward the stairwell and, minutes
later, is seen with the accused in the west stairwell as they leave through the
emergency exit. these events align with the 911 call and the body‑worn
camera chronology.
sequential
absence and presence of injuries
detective constable douglas observed that the surveillance clips
preceding the 911 call did not show visible injuries consistent with those
later reported and documented in photographs and on constable hunt’s body‑worn
camera. this contrast supports the timing of the alleged assaults: the absence
of injuries in earlier footage and their presence when n.b. was examined on
scene. constable hunt’s recording also captures n.b. describing these injuries
and pointing them out during her interaction with police, providing a useful
comparator.
utterances
of k.l. captured in detective constable douglas’ notes – evening of complaint
douglas first encountered k.l. at 12 division on october 12, 2024,
in the evening. he observed that she appeared lethargic and intermittently
incoherent, consistent with recent drug consumption. she made brief utterances
captured in his notes, paraphrased as references to “coke” and “speed” used to
keep her awake for work, and to advertisements under “jessica,” but was unable
to give a coherent statement and declined to proceed further. she was later
transported to a safe location.
utterance,
communications, and property provided by k.l. – post october 12, 2024
on october 13, 2024, at the safe location, k.l. remained unwilling
to provide a formal statement but stated: “i called the police because he
chased me and beat the shit out of me,” and not, as mr. laguerre suggested,
because he had contacted her child’s father and told him she was using drugs.
during this interaction she produced a damaged white iphone that she
identified as belonging to the accused and described it as a “trap phone” used
to communicate with clients and post advertisements for sexual services on
leolist; she distinguished it from his personal phone. she did not know the
passcode despite wishing to provide it.
k.l. acknowledged that she had used the phone occasionally but
stated that it was predominantly used by mr. laguerre.
the device was damaged and was later submitted by douglas for
forensic extraction.
leolist
corroboration of devices, numbers, names, and “trap phone” extraction
douglas subsequently consolidated leolist archive data and device‑extraction
materials from the phone. the partial extraction tied the damaged device to
specific identifiers, images, and screen captures associated with postings and
client communications in the relevant period. where items appeared as
screenshots saved in the photo library rather than native message records,
douglas explained provenance issues and relied on date‑and‑time
properties and continuity with other evidence.
in the days that followed, k.l. sent douglas near‑time
photographs of injuries and screenshots of communications (october 16 and 20),
together with identifiers she attributed to the accused’s personal and trap
lines; on october 23 she indicated she no longer wished to provide a statement
and wished to remove past comments. these communications, device artefacts, and
surveillance sequences are addressed in the analysis below to the extent they
bear on the material aspects.
detective constable douglas testified that, after k.l. identified
“jessica” advertisements and provided a number for the accused, he emailed
leolist’s legal department on october 15, 2024 to preserve and obtain account
data associated with the relevant postings. leolist responded with archive
packages and link data “within 14 days of posting,” including associated phone
numbers, emails, ip addresses, and cryptocurrency payment references. douglas
downloaded the material to usb and lodged it in property, then sought and obtained
judicial authorization to review the contents. those materials are set out in
detail in exhibits 94, 100, and 101.
the principal phone number tied to the super 8 postings during
october 6–12, 2024 was 438‑833‑0530, which douglas associated to
the damaged “trap phone.” a second number, 438‑765‑2591, was also
observed in the archive period and reflected in traffic jam captures. k.l.
later gave douglas both numbers and described one as the accused’s personal
line and the other as the trap line; douglas treated those attributions
cautiously, but used them as search pivots for legal requests and archive
matching.

communications between k.l. and “wooldy” via the trap phone and other devices
in her october 16 and 20 messages, k.l. forwarded to douglas
screenshots showing contacts saved as “wooldy,” with the 438‑833‑0530
number, and a second number she identified as his personal line.
douglas did not accept attribution on her say‑so; he cross‑checked
the “wooldy” number against:
(i)
the device msisdn from the extraction;
(ii)
traffic jam/leolist postings carrying that number; and
(iii)
contemporaneous screenshots of client coordination (room directions,
pricing, reply confirmations). those checks were consistent with the trap phone
being the live contact device used to coordinate services linked to room 408:
the telephone
number and related usage were identified by k.l. although the accused’s
statement contains similar information, that statement has been excluded and is
not considered in assessing corroboration under the
bradshaw
framework.
the screenshots provided by k.l. were as follows:

.
“traffic
jam” sex-trade archives from the trap phone
using traffic jam (the unit’s scraper that archives sex‑trade
advertisements), douglas located and saved leolist postings for october 6–12,
2024 that matched the phone identifiers above. those captures were filed as
exhibits 78–92, including entries on october 6 (initial mississauga posting),
october 7–10 (multiple daily reposts and edits), october 11 (late‑evening
posting) and october 12 (early‑morning posting). the archived ad bodies
and headers show the contact number 438‑833‑0530, consistent across
the relevant period, with connected verification imagery and metadata.
within the leolist data and device extraction, douglas identified
verification photos for “jessica,” time‑stamped during the stay (e.g.,
september 29 and october 6, 2024), and images that display distinctive tattoos
visible on k.l. the traffic jam and leolist packages also reflected internal ad
identifiers (issuer and ad ids) and payment artefacts (litecoin qr codes) that
douglas tied, by date, to the october 6–12 posting cadence. these materials
appear in exhibits 75–76 and 78–93.
cellebrite
extraction and cross-references to cctv, traffic jam, and leolist
from the partial cellebrite extraction of the damaged device,
douglas recorded the msisdn for 438‑833‑0530 and observed two apple
ids associated with the handset: jessica.brunette@icloud.com and
jay.thetruth99@icloud.com. he explained that while the extraction was limited
(updates corrupted some items), the preserved device information, file
properties, and image metadata allowed him to align creation and modification
dates with the traffic jam/leolist timelines and with cctv client‑traffic
windows. exhibits 75–76 document these items.
detective constable douglas acknowledged that many communications
appeared as screenshots saved in the photo library (“syndication” path) rather
than native entries from a messages database, limiting sender/recipient
attribution. he therefore used a triangulation approach: (i) device continuity
(the same damaged handset seen on cctv and produced by k.l.); (ii) identifier
alignment (438‑833‑0530 as the contact number within ad bodies and
screenshots); and (iii) temporal correspondence (timestamps in screenshots
matching client movements on cctv and posting times in traffic jam/leolist).
the frequently observed possession of the distinctive handset on
cctv, the third‑party composition of advertising images, and the
complainants’ inability to unlock the device all lead to the only likely
explanation that the accused had possession and control of the device, even if
it is accepted that k.l. and n.b. had access to it at times.
taken together, these factors support operational control by the
accused and render the alternative of independent complainant authorship
unlikely.
overall
continued evidence as it relates to corroborative elements
in sum, he testified that the leolist legal response and traffic jam
archives, together with device identifiers (msisdn 438‑833‑0530 and
associated apple ids), verification imagery, and date/time properties, when
tested against cctv and body‑worn camera chronology, corroborated the
functional linkage of 438‑833‑0530 to the damaged handset and to
the october 6–12 postings for “jessica” operating from room 408.
he further testified that although 438‑765‑2591 appeared
in the archive window, the operational coordination during the ontario stay was
anchored to 438‑833‑0530 and the damaged device (the “trap phone”).
he also described corroborative features that included sustained
room 408 occupancy with regular client traffic; the accused’s handling of
multiple phones including the damaged device later produced by k.l.;
contemporaneous cash handling by the accused; near‑time injury images and
device screenshots sent by k.l.; and the presence of room instrumentalities
consistent with the described assault mechanisms.
ii.
evidence of danielle dalton
constable danielle dalton testified that she has been employed with
the peel regional police since december 2023. she is fluent in both french and
english, having learned both languages from childhood and attended
french-language schools in ontario through grade 10.
on october 12, 2024, she was assigned to assist with french
translation during the interview of a complainant conducted by detective constable giacomo brunino at 12
division. the interview commenced at approximately 7:49 p.m. and took place in
interview room #3.
the interview was conducted in french and subsequently transcribed
and translated into english by an independent professional. all parties agree
that the resulting transcript is accurate and may be relied upon as the
authoritative record of what the complainant said. the video and translation
were filed as exhibits 4a and 4b, respectively, and the transcript is the
proper reference point for assessing the content of the statement.
constable dalton’s role was limited to facilitating communication
between detective constable brunino
and the complainant. she translated questions posed in english into french and
conveyed the complainant’s responses back into english. she had no prior
involvement in the investigation, was not briefed on its details, and was not
responsible for eliciting or interpreting evidence.
her function was to assist with language translation only, so that detective constable brunino could conduct
the interview in furtherance of his vice investigation.
dalton recalled that the complainant appeared tired and in pain,
particularly due to a burn on her tongue. the interview was paused at one point
to accommodate her discomfort. dalton described the complainant as polite and
cooperative, and noted that the complainant complimented dalton’s
interpretation during the interview. dalton did not observe signs of
intoxication or cognitive impairment, though she acknowledged the complainant
expressed fatigue and moments of confusion.
constable dalton confirmed that she did not observe or participate
in any threats or inducements made toward the complainant and stated that no
such conduct occurred in her presence. she was not aware of any discussions
regarding transportation or financial assistance to return to quebec.
she noted that cell phones were provided to the complainants by peel
police and stated they were left for them while they were asleep; in her view,
this would not have influenced their decision to cooperate.
iii.
necessity
necessity is conceded.
despite reasonable efforts, the complainants did not attend to
testify. their prior statements and captured utterances are therefore the only
way to place their accounts before the court for the purposes of the hearsay
application.
e.
threshold reliability: framework and approach
hearsay is presumptively inadmissible. it may be admitted where
necessity and threshold reliability are established. threshold reliability may
be shown by adequate procedural substitutes for the usual trial safeguards or
by substantive guarantees of trustworthiness that sufficiently overcome the
hearsay dangers of perception, memory, narration, and sincerity.
threshold reliability relates to the admission of evidence; ultimate
reliability relates to the weight afforded to hearsay if admitted as trial
evidence. threshold reliability can be shown by demonstrating that there are:
(1) adequate
substitutes in place to test the truth of the statement ("procedural
reliability"); or
(2) sufficient
circumstantial or evidentiary guarantees that the statement is inherently
trustworthy ("substantive reliability").
procedural reliability is concerned with whether the record
adequately substitutes for oath, presence, and contemporaneous cross‑examination.
complete and contemporaneous audio‑video records, cautions, controlled interview
settings, and accurate translations may serve as adequate substitutes where
feasible.
substantive reliability is concerned with whether the circumstances
and corroboration tied to the material aspects substantially negate the risk of
untruthfulness or mistake such that contemporaneous cross‑examination
would add little. corroboration must be connected to the particular point the
hearsay is tendered to prove and not merely show the case is strong in general.
i also accept the defence submission and mindful that “the threshold
reliability analysis has a constitutional dimension because the difficulties of
testing hearsay evidence can threaten the accused’s right to a fair trial.”
procedural and substantive reliability do not exist in mutually
exclusive silos, but rather work in tandem to overcome hearsay dangers,
“strength in one area, such as substantive reliability, can be compensated for
by procedural reliability and the opposite is also true.”
hearsay statements may be
admitted either on the basis of their procedural or their substantive
reliability. there are “two routes to the same destination…[and] are
equivalents in the quest to establish threshold reliability.” if procedural
reliability is sufficiently made out, then substantive reliability does not
need to be established”
when evaluating substantive reliability, a four-step analysis is
undertaken
that assesses corroborative evidence. as described in
bradshaw
, the
trial judge should:
1)   identify
the material aspects of the hearsay statement that are tendered for their
truth;
2)   identify
the specific hearsay dangers raised by those aspects of the statement in the
particular circumstances of the case;
3)   based on
the circumstances and these dangers, consider alternative, even specula
tive,
explana
tions for the statement; and
4)   determine
whether, given the circumstances of the case, the corroborative evidence led at
the
voir dire
rules out these alternative explanations such that the
only remaining likely explanation for the statement is the declarant’s
truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement.
a trial judge must consider the cumulative reliability of combined
statements, utterances, or circumstances when assessing the admissibility of
hearsay under the principled hearsay exception. however, this is permitted when
considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, that the only
likely explanation for the hearsay statement(s) is the declarant’s truthfulness
about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement. if the
hearsay danger relates to the declarant’s sincerity, truthfulness will be the
issue. if the hearsay danger is memory, narration, or perception, accuracy will
be the issue.
in a case of this complexity, with overlapping statements and
multiple sources of video and digital evidence, the assessment proceeds by
identifying the material aspects tendered for their truth, isolating the
specific hearsay dangers, and evaluating whether the combined procedural and substantive
features overcome those dangers to the threshold standard.
i.
the procedural reliability of the statements
procedural reliability is established where the record provides
adequate substitutes for the usual trial safeguards. since neither declarant testified
in court under oath or was subject to contemporaneous cross
‑
examination, there must be a satisfactory basis to assess the truth
and accuracy of the statements.
adequate substitutes may include a complete video recording, an oath
or affirmation, and an expectation to tell the truth with an understanding of
the consequences of lying. where feasible, some opportunity for cross
‑
examination (such as testimony at a preliminary hearing) is usually
required.
the
inability to cross-examine k.l. and n.b.
neither k.l. nor n.b. is available for cross‑examination on
any material elements of the hearsay utterances and statements. this is a
procedural concern at the threshold stage. however, where the crown establishes
that adequate substitutes for the traditional safeguards exist, presumptive
inadmissibility may be overcome because the hearsay can be sufficiently
trustworthy that contemporaneous cross‑examination would add little on
the material aspects.
this is the trial judge’s central preoccupation at threshold.
i will return to this in the final assessment once the corroborative
record is set out and the material aspects are analyzed. i note it here to
confirm that the inability to test the evidence by cross‑examination is a
live issue on procedural reliability.
body‑worn
camera and in‑car recordings
without repeating the body‑worn camera evidence detailed
above, i make the following observations relevant to procedural reliability for
the k.l. and n.b. utterances captured on body‑worn and in‑car
cameras
the court has the benefit of near‑continuous body‑worn
camera recordings from several officers and in‑car transport video for
relevant periods. these recordings preserve setting, tone, questions and
answers, demeanour, and observable context, including injuries, property, and
location references.
although the complainants did not make these on‑scene
statements under oath, the completeness and clarity of the recordings, together
with the contemporaneity of the circumstances, provide robust procedural
substitutes.
n.b.’s cautioned video statement to
police
n.b.’s interview was conducted in a controlled police interview
room, recorded in full on video, with interpretation provided by constable
dalton in french at the complainant’s request. the interview was cautioned for
truthfulness in a manner the complainant understood and proceeded at her pace
with breaks as needed.
the interpretation was performed by a bilingual officer with no
investigative role. an independent professional prepared the english translation
transcript and all parties agree it is accurate. the interview and translation
were filed as exhibits 4a and 4b.
while not taken under formal oath or affirmation, the complete
recording, truth‑telling caution, controlled setting, and accurate
translation function as adequate procedural substitutes permitting a rational
evaluation of the truth and accuracy of the material aspects.
the absence of an oath does not preclude admission under the
principled approach; the
k.g.b.
indicia are optimal, not prerequisites.
other circumstances may serve, for example, as a surrogate or proxy for the
oath
dalton testified that the recording provides a clear and complete
account of the interview. the complainant appeared responsive and coherent.
while emotional at points and reporting tongue pain, tiredness, and occasional
“blackouts,” dalton did not observe signs of intoxication or cognitive
impairment. the interview was paused to accommodate discomfort, and
interpretation was facilitated in french throughout in accordance with the
complainant’s preference.
from a procedural standpoint, the interview was guided by open‑ended
questions and proceeded on n.b.’s own terms. its scope was comprehensive on the
material topics the crown seeks to elicit. this is not to conflate procedural
reliability with substantive reliability.
i note this only to explain that the manner and circumstances of
the interview furnish robust procedural features; whether those features
translate into substantive guarantees is assessed separately.
therefore, the complete video record, the controlled setting, the
truth‑telling caution, and the provision of interpretation in n.b.’s
preferred language furnish strong procedural substitutes for the traditional
trial safeguards at the threshold stage. any concern about the absence of a
formal oath goes to ultimate weight, not admissibility, given the completeness
of the recording; the separate question of substantive reliability is addressed
by corroboration tethered to the identified material aspects below.
officer
notes of later utterances by k.l. (october 12–13)
these utterances appear in officer notes rather than a complete
audio or video recording. procedural safeguards are therefore lacking so the
the assessment turns more heavily on substantive guarantees and corroboration
tied to the material aspects. i address this below.
ii.
the substantive reliability of the statements
substantive reliability is established where the statement is
inherently trustworthy on its material aspects. the assessment looks to the
circumstances in which the statement was made and to evidence that specifically
corroborates or conflicts with those material aspects.
the standard is high, though not absolute certainty: the question is
whether, taken as a whole, the statement is so reliable that contemporaneous
cross
‑
examination would add little.
substantive reliability is met when the circumstances substantially
negate the possibility of untruthfulness or mistake, a cautious trier would
regard the statement as trustworthy, the material aspects are unlikely to
change under cross
‑
examination, and plausible alternative explanations are ruled out so
that the only likely explanation is that the statement is true.
material aspects of the statements and
utterances and the intended approach to the four bradshaw factors.
consistent with the guidance in
bradshaw
, following my ruling on the
res gestae
exception, i asked
the crown to identify the material aspects of the remaining hearsay it seeks to
admit under the principled exception. the crown did so in supplementary
materials and these appear summarized and charted at paragraph 249. for greater
clarity, i identify these material aspects as follows:

in listing the material hearsay above, i have identified only
assertions tendered for their truth. corroborative evidence such as hotel
surveillance, seized property, leolist data, and non‑hearsay body‑worn
camera footage is not hearsay. those items will be addressed in the
bradshaw
analysis at steps three and four.
the excluded statement of the accused is not considered in this hearsay
analysis.
statements describing present physical condition, such as “i hurt
everywhere,” are included for the limited purpose of proving present condition,
consistent with the crown’s approach and the defence concession of the
exception (albeit without the cause).
similarly, the 911 recording is admissible to show the complainant’s
contemporaneous emotional state, fear, and urgency at the time of the call.
this non
‑
hearsay purpose is relevant to context and timing and does not
depend on the truth of the assertions. the truth of its contents was already
ruled admissible above with narrow exceptions considered below.
because the hearsay dangers relevant to substantive reliability
(sincerity, memory, perception, and narration) recur across several categories
of statements identified above, i set out a single detailed analysis of those
dangers and then apply those conclusions, as appropriate, to each hearsay
source even if it is not specifically mentioned.
“identified
dangers” #1 – the “unsavory” (vetrovec) nature of n.b.
the defence submits that n.b. is, or approximates, a
vetrovec
witness.
they point to the fact that she was reportedly wanted by authorities
in quebec in relation to an alleged
criminal code
offence and suggest
this indicates prior dishonesty with police to avoid legal jeopardy. they also
note her concern about an outstanding warrant and conditions prohibiting her
from attending toronto.
i do not accept that submission for the following reasons:
•
there is no evidence of the nature of the
alleged obstruction or related conditions. it is unknown whether any alleged
obstruction was physical, procedural, or administrative; whether it involved a
lie to police; or whether it concerned protecting someone else. the information
is vague.
•
any criminal matter appears to be pending. n.b.
is presumed innocent. without further evidence, it would be improper to
conclude that a person facing unproven charges — including alleged offences of
dishonesty — is therefore less worthy of belief or has a general tendency to
lie to police.
•
she was not under investigation or detained in
relation to the allegations against mr. laguerre. in these proceedings she was
treated first as a witness and then as a victim.
•
peel police did not state or imply to her that
she was in jeopardy. to the contrary, they assured her that even if she had an
outstanding warrant in toronto, she need not worry because this was a different
region, and they would not detain her for that reason.
•
there is no evidence that she had a motive to
lie to police or that any lie would obtain a material benefit for her. even if
she were considered “unsavoury” (which i do not find), there is no identified
purpose served by any alleged lie.
•
the court must be cautious about negatively
classifying witnesses and alleged victims in human trafficking cases without
sufficient evidence. such individuals may have criminal records or outstanding
matters arising from drug dependency or other vulnerabilities that contribute
to their exploitation. these factors may also contribute to their unwillingness
to testify
but this unwillingness should not be a factor towards findings as a
vetrovec
categorization.
i therefore have no basis to conclude that n.b. is of such a
character as to inherently undermine her credibility or reliability.
“identified
dangers ” #2 – alleged motive to fabricate
as a relevant factor
,
the defence submits that there is a significant risk of deliberate falsehood or
motive to fabricate by k.l. and n.b., pointing to their repeated expressions of
interest in accessing the money found on mr. laguerre.
they further submit that k.l. and n.b. might have been involved in
criminal activity independently of (or in conjunction with) the respondent, be
it in relation to the sex trade, fraud or drug-related offences, and might have
wanted to obfuscate that fact and extricate themselves from criminal liability
by pointing fingers at mr. laguerre.
i do not accept this submission for the following reasons:
•
the money was seized by police from mr.
laguerre’s satchel. early in the investigation, both k.l. and n.b. asked about
funds they said represented sex‑work earnings. police made it clear the
money could not be returned and it was not returned at any time.
•
any alleged motive tied to obtaining the seized
funds dissipated once police advised that the money would not be returned. this
occurred early and before nearly all of the hearsay statements bearing on the
material issues.
•
whatever claim they believed they had to the
money was extinguished by police actions and communications. any motive to
fabricate on that basis would have ended well before: (i) the body
‑
worn camera interactions; (ii) n.b.’s video
‑
recorded
statement; and (iii) subsequent contacts.
•
to the extent police encountered apparent
criminal activity connected to drug use, sex work, client interactions, or
related proceeds, both k.l. and n.b. were candid about those matters. their
statements and conduct do not reflect attempts to distance themselves from
criminal conduct by false attribution to the accused.
on this record, there is no identified, ongoing incentive that
plausibly supports a motive to fabricate on the material aspects tendered for
their truth.
“identified
dangers” #3 – the possibility for collusion between k.l. and n.b.
the defence further submits that there was ample opportunity for
deliberate or inadvertent collusion between k.l. and n.b., potentially tainting
the hearsay.
they note that n.b. and k.l. were in each other’s immediate presence
before, during, and between several of those utterances, and that they spoke
french to one another while most officers were anglophone.
the defence also submits that multiple persons had unrestricted
access to the “trap phone” and to the hotel room, undermining the reliability
and attribution of any corroborative evidence arising from the seized items or
information.
i do not accept these submissions for the following reasons:
•
when police arrived, k.l. and n.b were in separate
locations; n.b. was found with the accused, mr. laguerre while k.l. was outside
the hotel panicked.
•
from first contact until departure from the
hotel in separate vehicles with separate officers, their interactions with each
other and police were captured on body‑worn cameras, including the
recordings of constable hunt (french‑speaking) and constable thurston.
•
there is no indication that k.l. or n.b.
attempted to avoid camera coverage or conceal conversations from attending
officers. each remained on camera throughout the material period, engaged
directly with police, and raised queries independent of the other.
•
the french utterances were transcribed into
english. the accuracy of those transcripts is not in dispute, and they contain
the hearsay the crown seeks to tender.
•
the body‑worn camera record permits a
detailed review of their interactions and supports the conclusion that there is
no evidence of collusion. to the extent overlap may affect ultimate weight at
trial, which can be assessed a
gainst the fu
ll audiovisual record through
to their arrival at the police station in separate vehicles.
•
even if there were brief moments when they could
have spoken without being heard, the body‑worn camera record captures
their interactions and shows no sustained or intensive conversation. nothing in
the footage plausibly supports the kind of sop
histicated, la
yered
collusion alleged.
•
although k.l. and n.b. were intermittently
together and spoke french, their material interactions with police from first
contact through transport were continuously recorded, and the admitted material
aspects are corroborated independently.
“identified dangers” – the state of mind
of n.b. and k.l. and influence of fatigue, narcotic, and stimulants (i.e.,
“intoxication”)
the defence submits that fatigue and drug use may have affected the
accuracy of k.l.’s and n.b.’s accounts. i do not accept that submission on this
record. the body‑worn and in‑car recordings show both complainants
responsive to questions, coherent in their descriptions, and able to
distinguish relevant details.
officers hunt, thurston, bolarinho, brunino, and dalton consistently
described each complainant as communicative and not impaired at the material
times. this is supported by their respective body‑worn cameras.
in particular, k.l. admitted earlier cocaine use, but on scene was
responsive and understood what was asked; n.b. reported tongue pain and
tiredness at the station, yet remained coherent, paused when needed, and
answered questions directly. these observations are captured in the recordings
and in the officers’ testimony.
the defence points to n.b.’s concern that she had “blacked out” and
to k.l.’s earlier drug use. on this evidentiary record, these do not translate
into confusion about what was happening or delusional behaviour that would
undermine the material aspects of their statements.
the videos show that each complainant was able to correct or limit
assertions when appropriate (for example, identifying injuries not attributable
to the accused), to differentiate phones and property on scene, and to anchor
statements to observable features such as room 408, the vehicle, and
contemporaneous movements. their measured clarifications are inconsistent with
the kind of confusion or distortion the defence suggests.
i therefore find that neither impairment nor fatigue undermines the
reliability of the complainants’ statements in any material way. to the extent
either factor was present, its impact can be assessed on the evidentiary
record.
with the discrete exception of k.l.’s brief, unrecorded exchange
with officer douglas upon arrival at the station, all material interactions are
audio‑ and video‑recorded, providing a reliable basis for this
assessment.
iii.
corroborative evidence enhancing substantive
reliability
while
bradshaw
sequences the consideration of “alternative
explanations” as the third step, that order is a matter of form, not substance.
in a case of this complexity, the analysis is best served by first setting out
the corroborative evidence and then assessing reasonably plausible alternatives
in light of that record, which properly tethers the alternatives to the
evidence.
a strict
bradshaw
ordering may be preferred where the
statement is isolated on a discrete issue (as in
r. v. charles
). however, in cases like this
one—where the material aspects of the hearsay are widespread and the analysis
is prolonged, complex, interconnected, and layered with corroborative evidence
and multiple witnesses—in my view it is most sensible to address the
alternative‑explanations analysis at the end.
as the court of appeal stated in
r. v. mcmorris
“karakatsanis
j. was describing the trial judge’s
anticipated
reasoning process,
not
its culmination
.”
that is my intent here. what matters is the culmination of the proper
application of all applicable principles, not the order in which the steps are
approached.
i do not read
bradshaw
,
charles
,
mcmorris
, or
other authoritative cases as requiring a siloed assessment of each “material
aspect” divorced from its context. plausibility must necessarily be assessed in
context and tethered to the specific material aspect at issue. some material
aspects may be discrete (for example, the cause of a particular injury); others
are cumulative (for example, the exercise of control). the proper approach is
therefore to evaluate plausibility on the totality of the admissible evidence
on the
voir dire
for each material aspect of the hearsay tendered for
its truth.
charles
reiterates
bradshaw’s
limits: corroboration must address the specific material assertion in dispute
and cannot simply show the case is strong in general. corroboration that is
equally consistent with competing hypotheses is of no assistance at threshold.
this assessment of competing
hypotheses and the residual worth, if any, of the corroborative evidence, is
addressed in “alternative explanations” analysis below.
the corroborative record (confined to admissible evidence on the
voir
dire
) is substantial and interconnected:
•
911 call: (admitted res gestae portions):
identification of the accused by name, age range, and origin;
recent assault “just right now”; method of assault (struck with cable/phone
charger); caller’s state of dress (t
‑
shirt, no pants) and loss
of phone; presence of another female; belongings (phone, k
eys, money) le
ft
in the room; money taken and fear it will be removed; caller from montreal with
no local supports and anxiety about returning; description of the accused
(build, clothing); vehicle details (grey honda civic with quebec paper permit, location
at hotel entrance); urgency and fear expressed; admission of earlier cocaine
use; concer
n the accused
w
ill leave with
her property.
•
cctv (super 8, fourth floor):
repeated client movements to and from room 408 over several days;
k.l. and n.b. using room 408; the accused accompanying or following them;
handling two phones (one damaged and later produced as the trap phone);
counting cash; placing a bag in the corridor; movements immediately before and
after the 911 call; sequences aligning with the stay and checkout on the
fifteenth.
•
digital records (leolist and device linkage):
postings and account data align with the number linked to the trap
phone; device managing consistent with coordination of client activity; later
extraction ties postings to the number identified in the complainants’
accounts.
•
body
‑
worn
camera observations
: the complainant distinguishes
her phone from the accused’s; identifies the accused’s vehicle and the
temporary quebec permit; confirms room 408; interactions with both complainants
captured throughout the material period from initial contact through departure
in separate vehicles; k.l. clarifies that an eye injury was not attributable to
the accused.
•
seized property:
cash
seized from the accused’s satchel; phones seized and lodged; property
processing and later count documented on station video; production of a damaged
phone consistent with the device seen on cctv.
•
cash and gold:
usd
and the serialized bill “gku9730776” held by k.l. compared to the money found
on mr. laguerre in his beige satchel upon arrest.
•
injuries and timing:
injuries photographed and recorded on body
‑
worn
camera; their absence in earlier cctv clips supports timing of the violence
alleged.
•
room condition and instrumentalities:
room disarray consistent with ongoing commercial activity; sex and
drug paraphernalia documented; false identification cards for k.l. and other
women found in the room; explanation that the accused made false
identification.
•
language and dependence:
both complainants spoke limited english while in ontario; neither
had money or phones at the time police arrived; expressions of concern about
how to return home without the accused; no vehicle available to them.
•
vehicle and room linkage:
identification of the accused’s vehicle and temporary permit on body
‑
worn camera; the room number provided by the complainant matches
room 408; officer notes and recordings align on these linkages.
•
final text communications (as summarized in
detective constable
douglas’s continued evidence):
late
‑
stage messages coordinating clients, timing, and movements to and
from room 408; references to availability and pricing consistent with leolist
postings and the trap
‑
phone number; timing aligned with the cctv sequences and the body
‑
worn camera chronology.
•
consistency:
apart from the absence of a weapon when police arrived, these strands are
internally consistent and align with the narrative captured on video and the
digital records.
iv.
alternative explanations that may diminish substantive
reliability
i now consider alternative explanations for the material aspects of
the hearsay.
bradshaw
permits the trial judge to canvass “alternative,
even speculative, explanations” at the identification stage, but only
alternatives that remain reasonably plausible on the record carry forward to
the final step of the analysis.
as stated by the ontario court of appeal in
r. v. mcmorris:
“any
speculative explanation, in short, must be plausible on a balance of
probabilities and any speculative explanation that does not survive such
scrutiny is to be rejected. any explanation left over becomes the plausible
candidate for assessment at step four; "the only remaining likely
explanation for the statement is the declarant's truthfulness about, or the
accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement." in other words, not
just any speculative explanation or fanciful idea suffices to abort the
threshold reliability analysis - only those that are, on reflection, reasonably
plausible.”
at the outset of submissions and prior to receiving written
submissions, i asked counsel to identify all reasonably plausible alternatives
they contend arise on the record, consistent with the
bradshaw
framework. i address those alternatives below and, where appropriate, return to
them in the corroborative‑evidence assessment.
as i am required to do, i have also attempted to identify other
alternative and speculative explanations beyond those identified by counsel.
those proposed alternative explanations are:
(a) the
injuries were caused by an altercation between k.l. and n.b., or by unrelated
client interactions;
(b) k.l. and
n.b. were independently engaging in sex work, with misattribution of control
and material benefit to the accused;
(c) threat
allegations (including a knife) were exaggerated or mistaken;
(d) cash found
on the accused was unrelated to the complainants’ work and derived from a
lawful sale;
(e) the “trap
phone” was used by multiple people and the screenshots are of uncertain
provenance;
(f) leolist
postings were authored by k.l. or others, not the accused;
(g) references
to “julian” reflect confusion or unrelated third‑party risk; and
(h) later
reluctance, disengagement, or recantation dynamics suggest fabrication on
material aspects.
the
cause of the injuries
it is suggested that the visible injuries resulted from a physical
altercation between k.l. and n.b. the defence says a volatile dynamic is
supported by a subsequent physical altercation between k.l. and n.b. in front
of police while they were being escorted to the train station, and by k.l.’s
911 statement that n.b. (along with the accused) was “against her.” it is also
alleged that inconsistencies in the allegations and in n.b.’s description of
the implement (telephone receiver versus phone‑charger cable) undermine
reliability.
other possibilities considered are that the injuries arose from
interactions with clients or by “julian,” who had pushed n.b. from a moving
vehicle on an earlier occasion at a high rate of speed.
it is submitted that these alternatives raise a plausible alternative
explanation that mr. laguerre was not responsible for the injuries. the 911
audio
captures a contemporaneous description of an assault “just right now” with a
cable or phone
‑
charger and repeated punching. body
‑
worn
camera preserves k.l.’s demeanour, state of dress, and fresh injuries, with
photographs documenting the same.
hotel surveillance shows movement sequences immediately preceding
the call and k.l. running from room 408. the mechanism described (cable or
phone cord and strikes) is consistent with instrumentalities visible in the
room and with images later recorded.
super 8 cctv -  k.l. running from room at
16:07:xx
the injuries are fresh. earlier cctv captures, in which the relevant
areas of skin are clearly exposed, show no injuries. the nature and pattern of
the injuries are strongly consistent with the described mechanism of whipping
with a phone‑charger cord together with strikes.
on‑scene video with officers hunt and thurston shows the
complainants reacting with shock and appearing to see the injuries for the
first time, and the contemporaneous photographs those officers took confirm
what is visible on camera.
for the sake of clarity and to convey how compelling the
corroborative evidence is, a photo of n.b.’s injury is included here to
illustrate the nature of that evidence.
for the same purpose, i include the photos relating to k.l.’s
injuries.
whether the injuries were caused by a phone‑charger cable, a
telephone receiver cord, or both, is immaterial; either or both scenarios are
consistent with the injuries observed and recorded. n.b. states in her police
interview that the accused hit her once on the back with the hotel phone,
causing an injury; she also witnessed k.l. being struck by the accused multiple
times, “everywhere,” with both a charging cable and the hotel phone.
the location of the hotel phone when police arrived at the room
further corroborates this allegation:
the body‑worn camera further shows k.l. and n.b. interacting
peacefully and supportively when police arrive and appearing surprised at each
other’s injuries when they raise their shirts to view them, which is
inconsistent with severe mutual violence having just occurred between them. the
911 audio and body‑worn camera align on timing, demeanour, and recent
onset.
detective constable douglas’s description of the argument while they
were being escorted to the train station, well after these events, is nowhere
close to the level of violence required to cause injuries of this nature. it
would be unreasonable to infer from this that either possessed a propensity for
violence toward the other sufficient to escalate to such obvious and serious
harm on the earlier occasion.
the specific alternative that the injuries resulted from an
altercation between k.l. and n.b., without any connection to mr. laguerre, does
not remain reasonably plausible when tethered to this corroboration on the
material aspects.
though not raised by the parties, i have also considered attribution
of n.b.’s injuries to “julian” and, similarly, to unidentified clients. those
explanations do not survive the same corroborative screening on the material
points. n.b. clearly delineates which injuries were caused by the accused and
which were unrelated. the injuries alleged to by n.b. caused by being thrown
out of a vehcile are clealry not recent, especially when compared to those that
she alleged just occurred.
k.l. also made it clear to police that her injured eye had nothing
to do with the accused, despite describing other injuries caused by him at or
around the same time. this shows comprehension of the question, precision in
attributable cause, and consistency throughout her explanations of how the
injuries happened.
considering these points together, the alternatives advanced by the
defence, and the additional possibilities do not remain reasonably plausible on
the material aspects tendered for truth. on those points, the only likely
explanation is truthfulness or accuracy, and contemporaneous cross‑examination
would add little.
k.l. and n.b. engaged in the sex
trade independent of the accused
the defence submits the complainants may have been engaging in sex
work on their own and shifted blame to mr. laguerre to avoid liability. it is
said that:
•
surveillance shows clients coming and going but
does not place mr. laguerre at room 408 contemporaneously with those movements
in a way that proves control or direction;
•
there is no footage of cash exchanges with the
accused and clients are often seen interacting only with k.l. or n.b.;
•
hotel registration and amex were paid by
“jessica schubring,” with records and extraction materials indicating bookings
and ad verification tied to jessica/jess, supporting the alternative that k.l.
(and possibly n.b.) were operating independently; and
•
leolist linkages tie several ads and contacts to
numbers k.l. provided, consistent with non‑accused posting or control.
on this record, the independent
‑
operation
alternative is not reasonably plausible. the evidence supports active
participation, and functional control on the material aspects. the
corroboration tied to the material aspects of control of communications,
postings, and retention of proceeds rules out the independent‑operation
explanation:
•
mr. laguerre was present from the outset of
their stay with his vehicle registered to park at the super 8.
•
they arrived from quebec, in mr. laguerre’s
vehicle, at the same time:
super 8 cctv - k.l. and n.b arrive –
october 6, 2024-  21:25:xx – exhibit 32
super 8 cctv - wl arrives - october 6,
2024: 21:29:xx – exhibit 24
•
the presence of mr. laguerre with n.b. and k.l. continues
cctv throughout their stay. cctv captures a significant amount of these comings
and goings. the following screen grabs are only a few examples of the totality
of cctv footage.
super 8 cctv -  october 6 at 22:45:xx –

super 8 cctv – october 9, 2024 –
04:53:xx – k.l., n.b., and w.l. returning to room 408 – exhibit 36
•
cctv sequences, even with motion activation and
the adjusted time offset, capture the accused handling two phones and counting
cash, and show client traffic to and from room 408 aligned with periods of
device activity;
•
the defence’s observation that the accused is
not always visible at the precise moment of each client’s arrival does not
create a plausible alternative where the combined sequences establish control
patterns over time.
•
the analysis does not require visibility of the
accused at the precise moment of each client’s arrival. the following screen
captures are selective screen captures and far from exhaustive of this
activity. the evidentiary record is extensive on this type of activity that
clearly supports clients coming and going.

•
the accused was the only one with a vehicle and
was responsible for bringing them to ontario to engage in sex work; similarly,
the accused was their only means of leaving once they completed their stay. the
accused’s vehicle was registered to the hotel, which would be unnecessary
unless he was staying during that time or, at least, for prolonged periods;
•
the accused is seen on cctv with two phones. one
is the distinctive, damaged “trap phone” used for coordinating with clients;
•
the “trap phone,” (examined in depth below), the
numbers and identifiers provided by the complainants, and disclosure materials
tying postings and ad verification to the same identifiers, connect commercial
communications to the device seen in the accused’s possession at material times;
•
the complainants were without funds and a means
home when police attended, while the accused possessed cash; that contrast is
contemporaneously documented on body
‑
worn camera and
photographs. in context, this aligns with retention of proceeds by the accused
rather than independent operation by the complainants;
•
in the hotel, k.l. and n.b. could not find any
means of funds or ability to return home. there was no stashed cash, no credit
cards, and no indication how they would be able to eat, let alone return home,
without the accused’s control;
•
the communications and advertisements were in
english, whereas n.b. and k.l. were not functionally english‑speaking.
this does not, standing alone, assist at threshold. the material aspects are
communication control and posting, and those are shown by device continuity,
identifier alignment (including leolist verification), and temporal
correspondence with client movements on cctv. while a translation application
could be used for some exchanges (even if less likely for rapid, real‑time
messaging), language alone is not a corroborating factor; any effect is a
matter of weight;
•
use of english in ads and some texts does not
undermine threshold reliability where the linkage is by device identifiers and
verification records rather than language fluency; interpretation was provided
when required;
•
hotel booking and amex payment under “jessica
schubring” do not, without more, establish independent operation. the issue is
functional control;
•
leolist linkages tie several ads and contacts to
numbers k.l. provided, consistent with non‑accused posting or control;
and
•
the corroboration of device control, postings
verification, and cash handling addresses the material aspects and mitigates
the need for cross‑examination on those points. considering these points
together, the alternatives advanced do not remain reasonably plausible when
tethered to corroboration on the material aspects of postings, communications,
and proceeds.
the only plausible explanation on those points is accuracy of the
complainants’ assertions of control and material benefit by the accused. on
those material aspects, contemporaneous cross‑examination would add
little.
threats and weapons
the defence submits that weapon
‑
use
allegations were exaggerated or mistaken. it is said there was no knife seized,
k.l. initially denied the presence of a knife on-scene, and later statements
reference a knife, suggesting unreliability on this point.
the absence of independent corroboration on this issue does not
detract from the evident threats and violence occurring in real time as
described in the 911 call, which has been ruled admissible.
i am prepared to accept that, without corroborating evidence, there
is a plausible alternative that a knife was not present. in particular, the
statement:
“he took a
knife out at me: ‘aren’t you on my side? if not, i’m stabbing you in front of
her.
’” (transcript of n.b., p. 8)
is not substantively reliable when
considered against other corroborative evidence.
therefore, any allegation
that the
accused threatened either k.l. or n.b. with a knife is not substantively
reliable on this record and is excluded
. i am
mindful of the need to avoid relying on corroboration that is not connected to
the material aspect sought to be proved and to confine the analysis to the voir
dire record. i find that cross‑examination would likely have a material
effect upon this particular allegation.
to be clear, this is not to conclude it did not happen; it is to
conclude that it is not sufficiently reliable under the
bradshaw
framework.
this exclusion does not detract from the considerable corroborative
evidence as it relates to the phone‑charger cord and/or telephone‑receiver
cord, and their use as a weapon in whipping k.l. by the accused. n.b. describes
cord‑based striking in a manner consistent with the 911 call, the cctv
footage, the visible injuries shown on the body‑worn cameras of thurston
and hunt, the photographic evidence, and the discovery of these items in the
hotel room upon police return.
as noted above, any inconsistency about whether a telephone receiver
or a phone‑charger cable was used is peripheral. the injuries’ pattern,
the visible instrumentality in the room, and the timing captured on cctv, 911,
and body‑worn camera align with cord‑based striking and recent
onset.
considering these points together, the alternative that the cord‑based
weapon was exaggerated or mistaken does not remain reasonably plausible on the
material aspects. on those points, the only likely explanation is accuracy of
the complainants’ assertions, and contemporaneous cross‑examination would
add little.
cash unrelated
to sex‑work proceeds
the defence submits that cash found in the accused’s possession was
unrelated to the complainants’ work and derived from a lawful sale or personal
funds. it is said that the surveillance does not show cash exchanges with the
accused, that clients are often seen interacting only with k.l. or n.b., and
that the absence of a direct hand‑to‑hand exchange on camera
supports the alternative of non‑control by the accused.
on this record, that alternative does not remain reasonably plausible
on the material points. corroboration
tied to the specific material aspects of retention of proceeds and deprivation
of funds rules out the lawful‑sale explanation:
•
body‑worn camera and photographs document
that neither complainant had any money when police attended. they had no funds
in the hotel, no funds on their persons, and no access to the car. by contrast,
the accused possessed cash and other value items, including usd and a gold bar;
•
a serialized $100 bill (gku9730776) corresponds
to the bill k.l. is shown holding in a photograph, indicating transfer of those
funds to the accused. in context, this is connected to retention of proceeds,
not general credibility. the defence questions whether the serialized bill can
be traced from k.l.’s photo to the currency seized. given the unique serial
number, the linkage is sufficient at threshold as part of the cumulative
corroboration of proceeds retention; any residual uncertainty goes to weight.
photo of k.l. holding the serialized
$100 bill found upon mr. laguerre upon his arrest (exhibit 75)
•
the extraction report (exhibit 75) shows that
the photo of k.l. holding cash was taken at 10:55:58 a.m. on october 11, 2024.
this was during their stay at the mississauga hotel and just over 24 hours
before police responded to the call.
•
the revenue‑mismatch critique adds nothing
at threshold. nightly “targets” are variable; gross receipts, competing
expenses, and the absence of banking records are immaterial to the dispositive
issue of functional retention of proceeds.
•
cctv shows the accused handling two phones and
counting cash during the operational period for room 408. client‑traffic
periods align with device activity and with the timing of the accused’s cash
handling. the absence of a single definitive hand‑to‑hand moment on
camera does not create a reasonably plausible alternative where the combined
sequences establish control patterns over time;
•
the complainants’ lack of means, including the
absence of travel funds and their stated inability to return to quebec without
the accused’s money, is contemporaneously recorded on scene. in context, this
aligns with deprivation of proceeds and functional control by the accused; and,
•
the motive‑to‑fabricate critique is
speculative and not connected to the material aspects. n.b. and k.l.’s early
focus on seized money is equally consistent with deprivation and immediate
need; there is no evidence of any benefit promised or obtained from police for
making allegations. further, it was obvious from an early stage and prior to
almost all the utterances that they would not receive the money that was seized
from the accused upon his arrest.
the lawful
‑
sale proposition is not supported by evidence connected to the
material aspects. the combined effect of surveillance, device control,
serialized
‑
bill linkage, and the documented absence of funds on the
complainants rules out the alternative on a balance of probabilities.
cross-examination would do nothing to undermine this.
trap
phone usage and screenshots
the defence submits that the “trap phone” was used by multiple
people, including k.l. and n.b., and that screenshots are curated or of
uncertain provenance. it is said that linkages to postings or client communications
may reflect k.l.’s own activity rather than the accused’s control. the defence
adds that k.l. had unmonitored possession of the phone for several hours (and
possibly up to a day) after the arrest.
body-worn cameras of hunt and thurston capture k.l. identifying the
device on scene as mr. laguerre’s phone. she offered to provide it; the
officers declined to seize it at that time. it was left in the hotel room and
later seized.
the cctv shows the accused handling two phones over the operational
period for room 408. one device is clearly the trap phone by its distinct
damage, visible on footage and matched to photographs. these strands are tied
to the material aspects of communications and posting control.
super 8 cctv -  w.l. holding two phones
– one identified as “trap phone” - october 8, 2024, at 17:11:26 - exhibit 34
super 8 cctv -  w.l. holding two phones
– one identified as “trap phone” - october 8, 2024, at 17:11:27 - exhibit 34
the above photo is particularly relevant as it corresponds to the
timing of text messages arranging sexual services at almost exactly that time.
from the extraction report of the trap phone, we see a screen grab of a text
message created at 5:32:52 p.m. as follows:
the content of that message is as follows:
similarly, at 6:32 p.m., another conversation takes place shortly
after mr. laguerre is seen with the phone. the following screenshot was
extracted from the “trap phone”:
the pattern of screenshots sent by mr. laguerre from client communications
that he was coordinating, to k.l. is corroborated by the screenshots that k.l.
forwarded to detective constable douglas. those images show the same room
number used for escort services during the relevant period. although the number
displayed is 409 rather than 408, the practical effect is unchanged because the
client would be outside the room. the discrepancy is consistent with either a
client mistake or a screening tactic. detective constable douglas testified
that the images depict the same super 8 hotel, identifiable by its distinctive
signage and room numbering.
on october 12, 2024, at approximately 01:24 hours, as k.l.
approached a male standing outside room 408, she was holding the “trap phone”
and what she described as her pink phone.
super 8 cctv  - october 12, 2024, at
01:24:33 a.m. – exhibit 47
super 8 cctv  - october 12, 2024, at
01:24:44 a.m. – exhibit 47
this does not detract from mr. laguerre’s possession and control of
the phone at other material times. even if k.l. had possession of the device,
the corroborative evidence as a whole supports the material findings: that mr.
laguerre exercised control over the services of k.l. and n.b., and that he
derived benefits from those services.
another relevant observation appears at approximately 16:32 hours
(cctv timestamp 15:52:48; exhibit 53), when the accused is observed holding the
“trap phone.” this occurs minutes after k.l. fled the room at approximately
16:07 hours and called 911 at 16:15, and after n.b. fled at approximately 16:13
hours. the device was later recovered inside the room. on this record, it is
reasonably inferred that the phone was left or returned to the room before
police entry.
super 8 cctv  - october 12, 2024, at
16:32 – exhibit 53
officers acknowledge that a large volume of media items was not
disclosed and that some images appeared via photo‑library “syndication”
rather than as messages, making origination and sender identity uncertain. much
of the text content consists of images of messages stored in the photo library
rather than records extracted directly from a messages database. sender and
recipient attribution is therefore uncertain, supporting a non‑accused
authorship alternative. on this basis, content could have been authored or
curated by k.l./n.b. or others, and the phone evidence is equally consistent
with non‑accused authorship.
that alternative does not remain reasonably plausible on the
material points.
•
the damaged phone provided by k.l. corresponds
with the device held by the accused visible on hotel surveillance and later
seized.
•
k.l. offered the device to constables hunt and
thurston when they returned to the room immediately prior to attending the police
station; the officers declined to seize it and k.l. and n.b. were indifferent
to that refusal.
•
k.l. did not know the passcode and could not
provide it even when she wished to give the phone to detective constable
douglas.
•
her mention of the device on body‑worn
camera is spontaneous and matter‑of‑fact.
•
if she were operating the device and intending
to curate content to implicate the accused or exculpate herself, the plausible
course would be to conceal or destroy it; she did neither.
in addition to these factors, the extraction contains personal
identifiers that link the device to mr. laguerre. they include a selfie of mr.
laguerre with a small child, a quebec identification card in his name (time
stamped august 8, 2024), and other photographs and account artefacts
associating the device with him. there is also an image (august 8, 2024) in
which he appears in the background without clothing, in an intimate context
with k.l., who is identifiable by a distinct, visible tattoo. taken together,
these items leave no plausible room to deny his access to, and control over,
the phone.
there are also photographs of identification for k.l. under a fake
alias. it is her photo, but a false name. that false name is then used in other
banking information and documents found on the phone. there is also a photo of
what appears to be a valid id for k.l. in her own name, expiring in may 2025.
there is also a photograph of an interaction where mr. laguerre was
stopped by peel regional police (occurrence # pr – 240200324) showing his vehicle at the time, and prp cars in the
background. it is unclear who took the photo but mr. laguerre was present at
this time and place.
it contains a photo of the hotel where the allegations took place
and where mr. laguerre was arrested.
the extraction contains numerous screen captures of text‑message
threads and hotel bookings saved as images in the photo library. their form and
sequence permit a strong inference that these captures were created to be
forwarded to k.l. and n.b. as notice of client attendance. on this evidentiary
record, the most plausible explanation for the systematic captures is
forwarding and coordination.
while native message metadata is not available for these images, the
pattern of capture and the temporal correspondence with cctv sequences, showing
mr. laguerre handling the trap phone at times aligned with client arrivals, corroborate
that inference.
as a few examples of this:
one screen capture supports an inference of forwarding and
confirmation. it shows a request for services described as “doing hard,” with
the relevant portion circled in red to draw attention for approval. on this
record, the most plausible explanation is that the capture was created to
forward the request to k.l. and/or n.b. to confirm consent. such highlighting
would be unnecessary if the person using the device were the sex worker already
engaged in the conversation.
the emphasis therefore supports that someone other than the worker
was in possession of, and using, the trap phone.
the extraction also contains multiple advertising images of k.l. and
n.b. that are, in the main, not selfies but photographs taken of them by
another person; however, the explicit nature of these photographs forbids their
inclusion in this judgment. the exhibits speak for themselves on the nature of
such images.
ad verification appears under the alias “jess” in postings and
photographs. there are numerous explicit photos and screengrabs on the phone
that will not be replicated here. the cumulative evidence supports that the
phone was used to coordinate the provision of sexual services.
many of those images are consistent with, and in some instances
identical to, the images used in the leolist advertisements. the pattern and
composition of the images, together with the time and date verification
required for leolist posting, indicate they were created for advertising rather
than casual self‑portraiture.
the phone contains considerable screen grabs of financial
information including confirmation of money transfers, litecoin (used in
leolist payments), and other indicia of control over the payments for sexual
services.
there is a screen grab of what appears to be a facetime call between
mr. laguerre and k.l. (in original but not shown here), which strongly suggests
he had control and possession of this device.
the screenshots and images relied are tied to the same device
numbers and contacts. their dates and times correspond with the client‑traffic
chronology observed on cctv. officer douglas’s contemporaneous receipt and
recording of the october 16, 20, and 23 materials, together with continuity of
contact from k.l., provide procedural substitutes sufficient to rationally evaluate
provenance and authorship on these material points.
the fact that certain messages appear as screenshots saved in the
photo library rather than as records extracted from a messages database does
not undermine their probative value at threshold. the decisive issues are
device continuity, identifier alignment, and temporal correspondence with
client traffic; on those points, the materials are sufficient.
the postings linkage is consistent across sources: the phone number
and email used for ad verification match the identifiers associated with the
damaged device and with the communications the complainants described. the
accused is observed with the device while counting cash, and the complainants
were without funds at police attendance. in context, these strands corroborate
control of communications and proceeds rather than independent complainant
activity. as seen on the cctv footage dated october 9, 2024:
super 8 cctv - october 9, 2024 - 04:45:xx
- counting money – exhibit 35
references to undisclosed media volume, photo‑library
“syndication,” or screenshot storage do not create a reasonably plausible
alternative on the material aspects. at threshold, the decisive features are
device continuity, identifier alignment (including leolist verification),
surveillance of the accused handling the device, and the temporal
correspondence between that handling and client movements on cctv. these
features speak to functional control during the period in question.
on this record, the suggestion of multiple‑user authorship or
curated screenshots does not remain reasonably plausible. contemporaneous cross‑examination
would add little on those points. the admitted strands are connected to the
material aspects of communication control and retention of proceeds, not to
general credibility.
the authoring, management, and
monetization of leolist postings
the defence submits it is a plausible explanation that the leolist
postings were authored by k.l. (and possibly n.b.), and not connected to the
accused’s control. it is said that several ads and contacts tie to numbers k.l.
provided, and that this is consistent with posting by someone other than the
accused or independent operation.
that alternative does not remain reasonably plausible on the
material points.
corroboration tied to the material aspects of posting control, ad
verification, commercial communications, and monetization rules out complainant‑only
authorship:
•
the phone numbers and email used for leolist ad
verification match the identifiers associated with the damaged “trap phone” the
accused was using, and the communications the complainants described to police;
this linkage addresses who controlled postings and derived benefit;
•
the damaged device provided by k.l. corresponds
with the device connected to the accused as described above, and contains
payment artefacts, including leolist verification records and litecoin payment
information; and
•
the dates and times of posting activity and
incoming contacts correspond with observed client traffic to and from room 408
on cctv, where the accused coordinates attendance and directs the operation.
i have considered detective constable douglas’s continued evidence
on leolist legal returns, traffic jam archives, and the cellebrite extraction.
while some content appears as screenshots stored in the photo library rather
than message records, and sender attribution is therefore uncertain, the
consistent alignment of device identifiers (including the trap phone number and
associated emails), posting timestamps, and client traffic observed on cctv
supports functional control over postings by the accused during the relevant
period.
i also consider these features of the record: the accused is
observed handling the distinctive damaged device; k.l. identified it on scene
as his phone and later produced it; neither k.l. nor n.b. knew the passcode;
most advertising images of k.l. and n.b. were taken by a third party rather
than by the complainants; and the device housed payment and verification
materials. in context, these features are inconsistent with independent
complainant authorship and support functional posting, management, and
communication control by the accused during the relevant period.
the fact that certain ads or contacts tie to numbers k.l. provided
does not create a reasonably plausible alternative. the issue is functional
control during the period in question. the combined effect of identifier
alignment, device continuity, surveillance of phone handling, retention of
proceeds, the absence of funds on either complainant, and temporal
correspondence with client traffic, considered together with douglas’s postings
analysis, rules out complainant‑only authorship on the material aspects
of posting, management, and monetization.
for clarity, the material aspect is not who physically posted each
ad. some may have been posted by n.b. or k.l. the issue is whether the accused
exercised functional control over postings, client management, and
monetization, that is, deciding when, how, and for what purpose ads were listed
and how payments and proceeds were handled.
references
to “julian”
it is conceded “julian” is a real person who resides in quebec and
refers to mr. julian sta*********z of montreal.
the defence suggests that references to “julian” reflect
fabrication, exaggeration, confusion, or unrelated third-party risk. i do not
accept this as a reasonably plausible explanation. the manner in which he was
described, the reason he was said to be coming from montreal, and the
complainants’ expressed fear—each communicated independently and spontaneously
to police—support a substantially reliable account of genuine fear. these
references were unprompted, and there was no discernible benefit in invoking
him beyond conveying concern about his imminent arrival and the accused’s direction.
when tethered to the corroborative record, including continuous
audio and video, the complainants’ observed panic, their urgency to avoid being
present when he arrived, and the chronology of departure from room 408, the
only likely explanation is accuracy of the complainants’ assertions of control
and recent violence by the accused. on those points, contemporaneous cross
examination would add little.
notwithstanding, i am not prepared to find that he is a “mafia guy”
as expressed by n.b. in her video statement to police. the material aspect
relates to the threat and fear said to arise from the accused’s statements, not
to julian’s alleged criminal connections, that he was bringing a firearm, or
that he engaged in any violence with n.b.
reluctance,
disengagement, or recantation
lastly, the defence submits that later reluctance to provide a
formal statement, disengagement, or recantation suggests fabrication of
material aspects.
i do not regard k.l.’s communications to detective constable douglas
as a “recantation,” nor as affecting the reliability of any material aspects
already considered.
according to detective constable douglas, k.l. “no longer wants to
provide a statement and wants to remove her past comments on the matter” and
“would like to retract everything.” he added: “i would not say she had lied,
but that she did not want to further pursue a statement, and she wanted to
remove everything from before.” these remarks convey a desire not to
participate, not an admission of fabrication.
such a position may be the product of fear, inconvenience,
inability, lack of motivation, or other reasons. these statements do not
support a sweeping conclusion of fabrication.
considered alongside the corroborative evidence noted above,
including body-worn camera evidence of fear and violence, the inconvenience
associated with her residing in quebec, and possible substance use issues,
k.l.’s nonparticipation is unsurprising and consistent with those
circumstances. her unwillingness to attend does not permit an inference that
she fabricated her prior account.
to the extent a finding is required on this point, i conclude that
her unwillingness to attend is more likely attributable to those circumstances
and is consistent with the truthfulness of what occurred to her and n.b.,
rather than fabrication. there is no evidence of fabrication, and considerable
evidence to the contrary.
v.
the inability to cross-examine and the effect on
trial fairness
hearsay is presumptively inadmissible because, in the absence of
contemporaneous cross-examination, it is often difficult for the trier of fact
to assess its truth. it may nonetheless be admitted under the principled
exception where necessity and threshold reliability are established. threshold
reliability is met where there are adequate substitutes for testing truth and
accuracy (procedural reliability), or sufficient circumstantial or evidentiary
guarantees that the statement is inherently trustworthy (substantive
reliability), such that contemporaneous cross-examination would add little if
anything to the process.
i am alert to the centrality of cross‑examination in our
adversarial process and to the caution against speculative predictions about
its utility, particularly where non‑attendance may signal reluctance or
potential recantation.
cross-examination is the traditional safeguard for testing truth and
accuracy, including the hearsay dangers of perception, memory, narration, and
sincerity. without adequate safeguards, hearsay may compromise trial fairness.
threshold reliability may be established by substantive features
alone or by a combination of substantive and procedural features. the standard
is high but not insurmountable. the question is whether, on the material
aspects tendered for proof, the circumstances and any corroboration overcome
the specific hearsay dangers so that cross-examination would add little.
corroboration is a major consideration in assessing substantive
reliability. its function is to mitigate the need for cross-examination on the
particular point the hearsay is tendered to prove. to assist at the threshold
stage, corroborative evidence must be connected to the material aspect in issue
and, considered with the circumstances, must rule out plausible alternative
explanations. corroboration that is equally consistent with competing
hypotheses, or that merely bolsters general credibility or guilt, is of no
assistance at this stage.
in the circumstances of this case, the corroborative strands
identified earlier are connected to the material aspects at issue and taken
together with the surrounding circumstances, rule out plausible alternative
explanations on those points. in those circumstances, contemporaneous cross‑examination
would be unlikely to alter those material aspects.
the threshold inquiry does not assume that the declarant will be
untruthful; it asks whether there remain plausible truthful alternatives that
cross-examination could realistically elicit on the material aspects. here,
there are no plausible truthful alternatives on those aspects that
cross-examination could reveal. the combined effect of the corroboration and
circumstances is that the most likely explanat
ion is truthf
ulness or
accuracy on those points.
i therefore conclude that, on the material aspects identified and
for the reasons already given, cross-examination would achieve little in
advancing competing truthful explanations or plausible denials.
as
bradshaw
explains, corroborative evidence that is equally
consistent with the
truthfulness
and
accuracy
of the statement as well as
another hypothesis is of no assistance.
with this emphasis in mind,
i do not read
bradshaw
,
charles
,
or the leading authorities on cross‑examination to require accommodating
outcomes premised on a witness being untruthful or feigning memory loss.
the inquiry is whether cross‑examination could realistically
elicit alternative outcomes that are consistent with
truthful
explanations on the material aspects tendered for proof. here, there is no
other plausible truthful outcome on those material aspects that cross‑examination
could reveal.
even if k.l. or n.b. were to testify and deny aspects of the
allegations made in their various hearsay statements, or profess memory loss,
the most favourable truthful admissions that cross-examination could elicit
would not plausibly overcome the corroborative evidence already canvassed that
supports the material aspects of their hearsay statements as truthful.
i therefore conclude, in considering the evidence as a whole, that
the corroborative evidence shows the only “likely explanation” for the hearsay
statements is the truthfulness of k.l. and n.b. and the accuracy of the
material aspects of their statements. those material aspects are unlikely to
change under cross‑examination, making cross‑examination
unnecessary.
as already noted, the two exceptions to this are whether a knife was
present for a threat, and the “mafia” background of julian, or his possession
of an ak-47 firearm. both of these areas i can reasonably anticipate cross-examination
having a material effect that is not necessarily one of falsehood.
f.
discretion to exclude on a residual basis: probative versus
prejudicial
in rare cases, even where necessity and threshold reliability are
established, hearsay may be excluded in the exercise of residual discretion if
its prejudicial effect exceeds its probative value in a way that threatens
trial fairness.
the gatekeeping role protects the truth
‑
seeking
function and ensures that the
voir dire
does not overtake the trial.
residual discretion also recognizes that, in appropriate
circumstances, rules of evidence may be relaxed for the defence to prevent a
miscarriage of justice.
the exercise of this discretion is case specific. while the hearsay here is
tendered by the crown, the court remains alert to preventing miscarriages of
justice and ensuring trial fairness. if there were any reason to conclude there
was risk or compromise, my conclusions on admissibility would require
reconsideration. on this record, i find neither.
the potential prejudice is limited. the evidence is confined to the
material aspects, does not invite speculation, and does not require a broad
collateral inquiry. the voir dire has not overtaken the trial, and the
admission will not produce unfairness through misuse or inability to test,
given the threshold findings already made. to the extent any hearsay touches
collateral matters (for example, a photograph of a firearm found on the trap
phone, bad character, substance use, language use, or sensitive images),
sitting without a jury, i will disregard them if inadmissible.
i therefore decline to exclude the hearsay in the exercise of
residual discretion.
g.
conclusion on the admissibility of the hearsay
as noted by the supreme court in
r. v. charles
, in some circumstances
hearsay “presents minimal dangers and its exclusion, rather than its admission,
would impede accurate fact‑finding.”
i find that to be the case here. with the sole exception of the
knife‑threat allegation noted above, the hearsay the crown seeks to
tender is admissible on all material aspects. i find that the hearsay is both
necessary and reliable on a balance of probabilities.
i have considered the combined effect of the procedural and
substantive features. threshold reliability may be established by either route
alone; they are not cumulative prerequisites. procedural and substantive
reliability provide two routes to the same destination.
on the procedural side, the record contains complete audio of the
911 call, body‑worn camera and in‑car camera recordings, and a full
video of n.b.’s cautioned police interview in her preferred language with
interpretation, all of which furnish adequate substitutes for the ordinary
trial safeguards.
on the substantive side, corroboration is tethered to the specific
material aspects: cctv sequences and timing; device continuity and identifiers;
leolist ad‑verification linkages; seized property including currency and
serialized‑bill linkage; the complainants’ absence of funds at the time
of police attendance; room instrumentalities; and contemporaneous images of
injuries.
considered cumulatively, these strands rule out plausible
alternative explanations so that the only likely explanation on the material
aspects is truthfulness or accuracy, and contemporaneous cross‑examination
would add little.
under the
bradshaw
framework, the alternative explanations
were canvassed and do not remain reasonably plausible when assessed against the
evidentiary record. the corroborative evidence is considerable and satisfies me
that cross‑examination of a witness, even if confronted with such
evidence, would achieve little, leaving minimal hearsay dangers at threshold.
part vi: conclusion on
all rulings:
the video recorded statement of mr. laguerre is excluded for
breaches of
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
and under
section
24(2)
.
the
res gestae
portions of k.l.’s 911 call are admitted. any
remaining parts of the 911 call, and all on‑scene utterances captured on
body‑worn camera, are admitted only under the principled approach where
identified.
the hearsay of k.l. and n.b. is admitted on all material aspects,
except the knife‑threat allegation, which is excluded. on the admitted
points, contemporaneous cross‑examination would add little.
references to “julian” are admitted as evidence of fear and context
only, not for any alleged mafia status, firearm possession, or unrelated
criminality.
residual discretion to exclude is not engaged. potential prejudice
is limited. sitting without a jury, i will disregard any collateral matters
that are inadmissible.
any remaining issues are matters of weight to be assessed against
the full trial record and as already conceded in the blended voir dire nature
of this proceeding.

it should be noted that the rulings on
the statement of the accused (inadmissible) paras 125-202 above; and the
admissibility of

230-245 above, were released in advance of the assessment of the remaining
“principled approach” hearsay analysis from para 249 onwards.
already ruled admissible under the
traditional
res gestae
exception to hearsay.
it is conceded that all officers’
body-worn cameras are accurate; i use bolarinho’s for the sake of calculations.
the statement was taken at 12 division
of the peel regional police, located at 4600 dixie road, mississauga, ontario,
l4w 2r1. the audio
‑
video recording of this
statement was filed as exhibit 9a. the corresponding transcript was filed as
exhibit 9b. there is no dispute regarding the accuracy of the transcript. the
entirety of the statement was played into evidence in open court before the
accused. although the accused had the benefit of a french interpreter
throughout the proceedings, he and his counsel, who is fluent in french, waived
interpretation during the playback. the interview was conducted in french. i
observed no misunderstandings or issues of comprehension during the interview
or the playback in court. the accused was advised that he could interrupt the
proceedings at any time should he require interpretation or clarification of
any aspect.
for clarity, the crown seeks only to
adduce the video recorded statement made at 12 division to officer douglas and
not any other utterances made during the course of his police interactions. to
the extent i may refer to other utterances, it is for the purpose of
establishing the necessary framework to decide the admissibility of the video
statement.

constable bolarinho’s body-worn camera
footage, like that of sergeant bennewitz and constables couce, thurston, and
hunt, is invaluable in illustrating the dynamic and evolving nature of the
investigation as it unfolded on october 12, 2024. the recordings from each of
these officers were played in court and filed as exhibits. available
transcripts were also filed, including those for the footage of sergeant
bennewitz and constable hunt, whose transcript included translated portions due
to the significant use of french. in addition to documenting key interactions
at the scene, the footage provides an evidentiary foundation for assessing the
admissibility of the hearsay statements of n.b. and k.l. under both the
principled exception and the res gestae doctrine. it also assists in evaluating
the voluntariness of mr. laguerre’s statement and the timing and adequacy of
the administration of his rights under
sections 10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
charter
.

: in quoting the findings of the committee on sexual
offences against children and youths (the "badgley committee") make
particularly sad and disturbing reading:
many girls who work on the streets
believe that a prostitute who gives evidence against a pimp is almost certain
to be murdered, if not by her own pimp, then by his fellow pimps.  these
murders are purported to be extraordinarily brutal and the prostitutes claim
that they are accomplished by severe beatings of head and face.  another
palpable fear of female prostitutes which suffices to dissuade many of them
from giving information about their pimps is that of being ostracized by the
other prostitutes in whose company they work.  furthermore, the committee's
survey indicates that many of the young prostitutes either were "in
love" with their pimps, or were psychologically dependent upon them to
such an extent that they could not conceive of functioning without them.  as a
result, many girls adopted a highly protective attitude toward their pimps and
were unwilling to divulge information which might have proved damaging to them,
or which portrayed them in a negative light. (badgley committee, vol. 2, at pp.
1057-58.)

as was the case in
r v jeffers
,
o.j. no. 1711
, where a witness in a human trafficking case provided a
kbg statement and was reluctant to testify. as explained by justice feldman, in
referencing this case, in
r v buchanan
,
2021 oncj 256
“the complainant gave a lengthy,
cautioned kgb statement under oath that was recorded. she later provided an
unsworn videotaped statement alleging the accused pressured her to swear an
affidavit that her first statement was false. she said that as a result she
feared for her safety.
it turned out that the
complainant was a reluctant witness. she failed to attend court and was
arrested on a warrant. in her testimony, she re-characterized her relationship
with the accused as one of friendship and mutual business partnership. of
significance, she said her kgb statements were ‘stretched’, but not false. her
text messages inculpated the accused. in cross-examination, she admitted that
which favoured the defence.
justice duncan described the
kgb rule as one “designed to advance the truth-seeking function of the courts
and also to reduce the potential benefit that could be achieved by witness
intimidation or improper influence”. in this case, justice duncan viewed the
complainant’s kgb statement as a “spontaneous narrative” that was given without
prompting or leading. he found her kgb statements to contain “an extraordinary
amount of detail” in which the complainant appeared to be “very open and
candid”.
his review of the videotape
led him to reject the complainant’s evidence that she gave her “false”
statement both because she was under the influence of cocaine and as a result
of pressure to please the police. he saw her as “perfectly lucid and sensible
throughout”, not restless, distracted or impaired in her thinking. he found the
notion of police pressure rebutted by her i-phone notes.
