facts
on
april
14,
2024,
mr.
martin
entered
into
a
s.
810
recognizance
as
a
resolution
to an assault with a weapon charge.
the statutory terms including a requirement that he keep the
peace and be of good behaviour were in place for 12 months.
on july
14,
2024,
a good citizen
called
his
neighbour
who was
at work
in toronto to
advise
him
that
someone
had
broken
into
his
home
next
door.
the
homeowner
rushed from toronto to barrie and found mr. martin sitting on his back
porch eating breakfast. mr. moore had broken into the residence.
the lock of the garage had been broken.
the homeowner called police.
police arrived and spoke with mr. moore
who falsely identified himself as joseph smith.
after some time, he admitted that he was in fact martin moore.
police learned that martin moore was
wanted on a warrant for an allegation
of
an
assault
with
a
weapon
and
was
on
the
s.810
recognizance
for
an
offence
of assault with a weapon.
the police advised mr. moore that
he was under arrest.
a struggle
ensued and mr.
moore
attempted
to
disarm
the
officer.
the
officer
was
fearful
that
he
would
grab
his taser and it would be used against
him.
mr. moore was eventually taken
to the ground.
mr.
moore
was
released
on
a
judicial
interim
release
order.
on december 29th, 2024, a
community citizen was notified by his bank of suspected fraudulent transactions
from the night before.
his bank cards
were then locked. various cards were used at a convenience store and used at
least twice to purchased gift cards.
mr.
moore
was
arrested
and
released
on
an
undertaking.
on january 6, 2025, concerned citizens
called to report that a man was standing in the middle of an intersection and
impeding traffic.
police arrived on
scene and the man told police that his name was jack.
police identified the man as mr. moore and noted that
he
was
wanted
on
a
warrant
for
aggravated
assault.
police
attempted
to
arrest him, but
he
attempted
to
run.
he
then
punched
the
officer
in
the
side
of
the
head
with
a
closed fist.
a physical struggle ensued, in the middle of the intersection.
two citizens became involved to assist the
officer until back up arrived.
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
for
consideration
the
following
facts
are
mitigating
on
sentence:

the
pleas
of
guilt
and
acceptance
of
responsibility;
(3)

has been struggling with depression and his life “took a downward spiral during
covid”, he turned to drugs and has been using
a
variety
of
street
drugs
ever
since.
it
should
be
noted
that
he
does
not
have an official mental health diagnosis.
the
following
facts
are
aggravating
on
sentence:
(1)
mr. moore was subject to a s. 810
recognizance at the time of each of the
offences;
(2)
the s.810 recognizance was a
resolution in respect of an assault with a weapon charge;
(3)
mr.
moore
falsely
identified
himself
on
both
july
14
th
and
january
6
th
;
(4)

wanted on a warrant for an allegation of assault with a weapon as of july 14
th
;
(5)
mr. moore’s efforts to disarm the
officer cause the officer to fear for his
safety;
(6)
mr. moore’s efforts to
disarm the
officer necessitated
the
officer taking him to the ground;
(7)
mr. moore’s efforts to disarm the
officer put himself, the officer, the homeowner and the neighbourhood at risk
for harm;
(8)
on
december
28,
2024,
mr.
moore
was
on
a
judicial
interim
release
order;
(9)
on december
28,
2024, mr.
moore’s
actions
were sophisticated,
using
the stolen credit and debit
cards to purchase gift cards for later use or sale;
(10)
on
january
6,
2025,
mr.
moore was
on
a
judicial
interim
release
order

wanted on a warrant for an allegation of aggravated assault;
(13)
on
january

assault of the officer took place in the middle of a traffic intersection,
causing significant risk of harm to both the officer and the public;
(16)

assault of the officer required two concerned citizens to have to come to the
officer’s assistance, also putting those two citizens at great risk of harm;
position
of
the
parties
at the conclusion of the crown’s
submissions which sought a global sentence of 120 days, and this court’s
expressed concerns about the fitness of that quantum, the defence
sought
instructions
from
mr.
moore
and
then
returned
to
advise
that
the
position was now a joint position.
the ultimate joint submission
proffered is for a total global custodial sentence of 120 days less any
presentence custody, and suggested as follows:
(1)
attempted
disarming
of
a
peace
officer
–
60
days
custody
less
presentence
custody, 12 months probation, s. 109 for 10 years, and a dna order;
(2)
break
and
enter
into
a
dwelling
house –
30
days
custody
consecutive,
less presentence custody, a concurrent 12 months probation,
concurrent s. 109 order for 10 years, and a dna order;
(3)
fraud under $5000 – suspended
sentence and a concurrent 12 months probation order;
(4)
assault peace officer – 30 days
custody consecutive, less presentence custody, a concurrent 12 months
probation, s. 110 order for 5 years, and a dna
order.
the
offence
of
disarming
or
attempting
to
disarm
a
peace
officer
mr. fisher submits that the facts
before the court establish an attempt to disarm, not
an
actual
disarm
and
thus
should
be
considered
less
serious.
mr.
fisher
also
submits
that because the defendant
attempted
to take
the officer’s taser, and
not his
firearm, the offence should be considered a less serious. the
criminal
code
reads:
270.1
270.1(1)
disarming
a
peace
officer
every
one commits an offence who, without the consent of a peace officer, takes or
attempts
to
take
a
weapon
that
is
in
the
possession
of
the
peace
officer
when
the
peace officer is engaged in the execution
of his or her duty.
270.1(2)
definition
of
"weapon"
for
the
purpose
of
subsection
(1),
"weapon"
means
any
thing
that
is
designed
to
be used to cause injury or
death to, or to temporarily incapacitate, a person.
270.1(3)
punishment
every
one
who
commits
an
offence
under
subsection
(1)
is
guilty
of
(a)
an
indictable
offence
and
liable
to
imprisonment
for
a
term
of
not
more
than
five
years;
or
(b)
an
offence
punishable
on
summary
conviction.
it is clear
that parliament did not intend for
an
attempt to disarm
to be considered less serious.
section
270.1(1) includes takes or attempts to take as one in the same.
i find
that
parliament’s
intention
was
to
criminalize
the
action,
not
the
outcome
of
the
action. that
is
to say,
because
an
offender
was
not
successful
in
his
action,
does
not
mean
that
the
offender
has
committed
a
less
serious
offence.
it
is
not
mitigating
that
mr.
moore
was not successful in disarming the officer; the officer would not have
known in the moment what
the
outcome
would
be,
and
the
impact
upon
him
and
those
observing
the
attempted
disarming would be significant.
section
270.1(2)
defines
a
weapon
as
anything
that is
intended
to
cause
death,
to injury or to
incapacitate a person.
parliament has
not sought to distinguish the various
weapons
that
a
peace
officer
might
possess,
i.e.,
a
firearm,
a
taser,
a
baton,
pepper
spray,
etc., thus not creating a hierarchy of seriousness based upon the
specificity of the
weapon.
again,
the
intention
is
to
criminalize
the
action
of
an
accused
person
who
attempts to take a weapon of a peace
officer who is engaged in the execution of his duty.
the underlying
goal
of
said
accused
is
to
stop
the
officer
from
executing
his
duty,
i.e.
effecting
an
arrest,
and
in
addition,
the
risk
posed
is
to
potentially
cause
harm
to
someone
with
the weapon, i.e.
themselves, the officer or another citizen.
the
external circumstances are complete even if the defendant does not gain actual
possession of the weapon.
mr.
moore’s
efforts
to
disarm
the
officer
were
only
unsuccessful
because
the
officer was able to thwart those efforts,
putting his own safety at risk in doing so.
mr.
moore’s failure is not a mitigating factor.
mr.
moore’s
efforts
to
take
the
officer’s
taser
and
not
his
firearm,
is
not
a
mitigating factor.
the goal was to debilitate the officer’s
execution of his duties.
sentencing
caselaw
for
disarming
an
officer
the maximum penalty is 5 years
where the crown proceeds by indictment, as herein.
there are few
reported
cases to reference.

joint
submissions
the
supreme
court
in
r.
v.
anthony-cook
,
2016
scc
43
,
held
that:
25
it is an
accepted and entirely desirable practice for crown and defence counsel to agree
to a joint submission on sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty. agreements
of this nature are commonplace and vitally important to the well-being of our
criminal justice system, as well as our justice system at large. generally,
such agreements are unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges
without any difficulty. occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to
be unduly lenient, or perhaps unduly
harsh,
and
trial
judges
are
not
obliged
to
go
along
with
them
(
criminal
code
,
r.s.c.
1985, c. c-46, s. 606(1.1)(b)(iii)
). in such cases, trial judges need a test against
which to measure the acceptability of the joint submission. the question is:
what test?
31
having considered the various
options, i believe that the public interest test, as amplified in these
reasons, is the proper test. it is more stringent than the other tests proposed
and
it
best
reflects
the
many
benefits
that
joint
submissions
bring
to
the
criminal
justice system and the corresponding need for a high degree of certainty in
them. moreover, it is distinct from the "fitness" tests used by trial
judges and appellate courts in conventional
sentencing
hearings
and,
in
that
sense,
helps
to
keep
trial
judges
focused
on the unique
considerations that apply when assessing the acceptability of a joint
submission.
to
the
extent
verdi-douglas
holds
otherwise,
i
am
respectfully
of
the
view
that
it is wrongly decided and should not be followed.
a.
the
proper
test
32
under
the
public
interest
test,
a
trial
judge
should
not
depart
from
a
joint
submission on
sentence unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest. but, what does
this threshold mean?
two
decisions
from
the
newfoundland
and
labrador
court
of
appeal
are
helpful
in this regard.
33
in
druken
, at para.
29, the court held that a joint submission will bring the administration of
justice into disrepute or be contrary to the public interest if, despite the
public
interest
considerations
that
support
imposing
it,
it
is
so
"markedly
out
of
line
with
the expectations
of
reasonable
persons
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
that
they
would
view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the criminal justice
system". and, as stated
by
the
same
court
in
r.
v.
o.
(b.j.)
,
2010
nlca
19
(n.l.
c.a.)
(canlii),
at
para.
56
, when assessing a joint submission,
trial judges should "avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed
and reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the
courts".
34
in
my
view,
these
powerful
statements
capture
the
essence
of
the
public
interest
test developed by
the martin committee. they emphasize that a joint submission should not be
rejected lightly, a conclusion with which i agree. rejection denotes a
submission so unhinged
from
the
circumstances
of
the
offence
and
the
offender
that
its
acceptance
would lead
reasonable
and
informed persons, aware
of all
the
relevant
circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution
discussions, to believe that the proper functioning
of
the
justice
system
had
broken
down.
this
is
an
undeniably
high
threshold — and
for good reason, as i shall explain.
42
hence,
the
importance
of
trial
judges
exhibiting
restraint,
rejecting
joint
submissions only
where
the
proposed
sentence
would be
viewed
by
reasonable and informed
persons as
a
breakdown
in
the
proper
functioning
of
the
justice
system.
a
lower
threshold
than
this
would
cast
the
efficacy
of
resolution
agreements
into
too
great
a
degree
of
uncertainty.
the public
interest
test
ensures
that
these
resolution
agreements
are
afforded
a
high
degree
of
certainty.
43
at the same time, this test also
recognizes that certainty of outcome is not "the ultimate goal of the
sentencing process. certainty must yield where the harm caused by accepting
the
joint
submission
is
beyond
the
value
gained
by
promoting
certainty
of
result" (
r.
v.
desousa
,
2012
onca
254
,

(ont.

,
per

j.a.,

conclusion
i
am
mindful
that
mr.
moore
is
34
years
of
age
and
a
first-time
offender.
the matter was not judicially
pretried and i can rely only upon the scarce submissions of counsel, which
predominately relied upon the fact that the position was ultimately a joint
submission.
nothing was filed in
support of this position.
the caselaw
that this
court
has
been
able to review suggests a sentencing range beginning
in excess of that which is submitted to this court.
with respect, i find that the
joint submission is so “unhinged from the circumstances
of
the
offence
and
the
offender
that
its
acceptance
would
lead
reasonable and
informed
persons,
aware
of
all
the relevant circumstances, including
the
importance of
promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper
functioning of the justice system had broken down”.
i
reject
the
joint
submission
proposed.
there
are
many,
many,
many
aggravating
factors
for
consideration.
i
have
nothing more than the bare submission of
defence counsel to substantiate the undiagnosed mental
health
struggles of
mr. moore,
and
as
such
a
longer
term
of
probation
is required to assist in his assessment and rehabilitation.
there is no current plan of release or
rehabilitation
and
mr.
moore
presents
as
a
risk
to
the
community
with
his
string
of
violent offences over the last year.
i
sentence
mr.
moore
as
follows:
(1)
july
14,
2024
–
attempted
disarming
of
a
peace
officer
–
180
days
custody, less
91
days
presentence
custody
enhanced
to
138
days
credit,
leaving
a
remnant sentence
of
42
days
custody,
18
months
probation,
s.109
order
for
10
years,
and
a dna order;
(2)
july 14, 2024 –
break
and
enter into a dwelling house – 150 days custody, to be served concurrently to
the disarm peace officer offence,
18
months concurrent probation order, s. 109 order for 10 years, and a dna order;
(3)
december 28, 2024 –
fraud under $5000; suspended sentence and
18 months concurrent probation;
(4)
january
6,
2025
–
assault
peace
officer
–
120
days
custody,
consecutive
to the disarm peace officer offence, 18 months concurrent
probation order, s.110 order for 5 years.
the
total
global
sentence
is
300
days
less
138
enhanced
presentence
credit,
for
a remnant sentence of 162 days custody
and ancillary orders.
