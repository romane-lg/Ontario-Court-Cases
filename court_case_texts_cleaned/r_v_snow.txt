dear user,
canlii calls upon users accessing its services a large number of times to ensure that they are people and not programs acting on command.
indeed, massive downloads are prohibited by canlii’s terms of use. though your own use may be quite limited, it may have been compiled with that of others
in your organization and in the end, the total volume of access is high.
if you are not a computer, please proceed with our captcha test below. you can then resume your work where you left off.
to report any issue, please

.
happy searching!
