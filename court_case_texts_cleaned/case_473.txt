introduction
db first pled before me on january 10,
2024, for an indecent act on his 5-year-old cousin in 1974, more than 50 years
ago. the matter was adjourned for sentencing.
then this case took a few unusual turns.
ultimately, i am now to decide both the constitutionality of ss.
42(2)(p) and 42(5)(a) of the
youth criminal justice act
(
ycja
),
and the fit sentence for db.
these are my reasons on the constitutional question. i will
provide separate reasons for sentence.  (
r. v. d.b
.,
2025 oncj 39
)
ii.
procedural history
after the “first” guilty plea on january 10,
2024, sentencing was adjourned for material to be filed by both parties and
submissions to be made on may 6, 2024. db was represented by counsel at the
time.
after submissions on may 6, 2024, i informed the
parties that because db was 17 years old in 1974, pursuant to ss. 158-159 of
the
youth criminal justice act
(
ycja
), the information laid under
the
juvenile delinquents act
acted on january 10, 2024 was improper and
the process followed was flawed.
on june 18, 2024, the guilty plea was struck, a
new
ycja
information was sworn, and a proper guilty plea to
s. 149
of
the
criminal code
was entered.
all the material filed by both parties was
re-filed. the crown modified its sentencing position, but counsel continued to
pursue his position that a fit sentence was a conditional one.
i informed counsel at the time that a
conditional sentence is not an available sentence for a young person. its
equivalent under the
ycja
, a deferred custody supervision order (dcso),
was also not available, as the offence pled to is an excluded one.  however, i
referred the parties to
r. v. t.m.
2024 oncj 257
which had been decided
just weeks before. it held that the
ycja
sections barring a dcso were
unconstitutional. the matter was adjourned for counsel to consider his
position.
counsel had been ill throughout these proceedings. he had been
appearing virtually to accommodate his medical condition.   on november 1,
2024, counsel applied to be removed from the record as he was medically unable
to continue to represent db. i granted the application.
db chose to represent himself for the remainder of the proceedings.
given the circumstances, on november 1, 2024, i appointed
amicus
curae
, emma rhodes, to assist the db, a young person, in relation to the
finding of guilt, and to address the constitutionality issue i had raised.
on november 11, 2024,
amicus curiae
filed an application to
challenge the constitutionality of sections 42(5)(a)  and 42(2)(p) of the
ycja
in db’s pursuit of a dcso.
iii.
constitutional context and issues
the
canadian charter of rights and freedoms
provides:
section 15
: every individual is equal before and under the law and has the
right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without
discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race,
national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical
disability.
section 7
: everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person
and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice.
the
ycja
section 42(5)(a) excludes the availability of a
dcso, a custodial sentence served in the community, for offences committed by a
young person that “causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm”.
section 42(2)(p) of the
ycja
limits a dcso for a “specified
period not exceeding 6 months”.
the
criminal code
’s adult equivalent for a custodial
sentence served in the community, a conditional sentence order (cso) is
provided in s. 742.1. neither the nature of the offence “causes or attempts to
cause serious bodily harm” nor the 6-month limitation applies to a cso for adults.
an indecent act is a sexual offence. it is well-established sexual
offences cause serious bodily harm. an indecent act is therefore an excluded
offence for a dcso for a young person per the
ycja
but an indecent act is
not an excluded offence for a cso in the
criminal code
for an adult.
this distinction is the root of the constitutional issue.
therefore, the two constitutional questions to be determined are:
(1)
does s. 42(5)(a) and 42(2)(p) of the
youth
criminal justice act
violate
s. 15
of the
canadian charter of rights and
freedoms
?
(2)
does s. 42(5)(a) and s. 42(2)(p) of the
youth
criminal justice act
violate
s. 7
of the
canadian charter of rights and
freedoms
?
iv.
position of the parties
amicus curiae
submits that should i find
that a dcso is the most appropriate sentence for db, and that a dcso for a
period of more than 6 months is the most appropriate length, it would require
me to find that ss. 42(5)(a) and 42(2)(p) violate
ss. 15
and
7
of the
charter
,
and to the extent of the violations, are of no force and effect.
further,
amicus curiae
submits that the principle of horizontal
stare decisis
applies to this case. justice camara of the ontario court
of justice found that ss. 42(5)(a) and 42(2)(p) violate both
ss. 15
and
7
of
the
charter
in
tm.
she submits that pursuant to
r. v. sullivan
,
2022 scc 19
, i am bound
by
t.m
.
the crown agrees with
amicus curiae’s
submission on the
applicability of horizontal
stare decisis
in this case.
the crown submits that the same factual and legal circumstances in
t.m
.
exist in the case at bar. the applicant raises the same issues as those in
t.m.
and i am therefore bound to follow the precedent set in
t.m.
the crown made no submissions on either the constitutionality of the
impugned
ycja
provisions or on whether they are justified by
s. 1
of the
charter
.
v.
constitutional analysis
the analysis of the constitutional question must proceed via two
steps:
i.
if i find that a dcso is not an appropriate
disposition for db, i may decline to answer the constitutional question.
ii.
if i find a dcso to be an appropriate
disposition for db, and the appropriate length of it to be more than 6 months,
i am bound by horizontal
stare decisis
to strike down s. 42 (5)(a) and
declare the 6-month limitation in 42(2)(p) invalid.
db is a 68-year-old man who has pled guilty to an offence he
committed 50 years ago when he was only 17 years old. his circumstances at the
time were severely compromised. he had been sent to canada alone at the age of
13. he was in canada illegally. he was not permitted to go to school.  he was unparented.
db has pled guilty and demonstrated significant remorse. these circumstances
warrant the consideration of a dcso as a disposition.
given the serious nature of the offence, and its impact on the
victim, however, a 6-month term would be inappropriate. a dcso longer than 6
months would be required to reflect the gravity of the offence if a dcso is to
be imposed.
as a result, i must decide the constitutional questions.
however, my task is simplified as both the crown and
amicus curiae
submit the  principle of horizontal
stare decisis
applies.
justice camara in
t.m.
found that both ss. 42(5)(a)
and 42(2)(p) of the
ycja
violate both
ss. 15
and
7
of the
charter
when she stated at para. 46:
…the distinction based on age
created by ss. 42(5)(a) and 42(2)(p) of the
ycja
does deny
young persons a benefit in a manner that reinforces, perpetuates and
exacerbates their disadvantage.  rather than working in tandem with the rest of
the sentencing scheme of the
ycja
to address the disadvantage of young
persons arising from their diminished moral blameworthiness, the impugned
provisions work against it. they prevent youth court justices from giving
meaning to the important ameliorative provisions and may result in
sentences that actually violate them. this is not a situation where a
side-by-side comparison of the dcso provisions of the
ycja
and
the cso provisions of the
criminal code
demonstrates a
simple distinction, it is a situation where the
distinction that arises between the two has the effect of denying young persons
the benefit of a fit and appropriate sentence and thereby perpetuates the
disadvantage occasioned by their age.
per
sullivan
, there are three narrow circumstances in which
trial courts should depart from a binding decision issued by a court of
coordinate jurisdiction. these are:
(1)
the rationale of an earlier decision has been
undermined by subsequent appellant decisions.
(2)
the earlier decision was reached
per incuriam
(“through carelessness” or “by inadvertence”); or
(3)
the earlier decision was not fully considered,
e.g. taken in exigent circumstances.
none of these circumstances apply to justice camara’s decision. hers
is a clear, thoughtful, well-reasoned analysis.
vi.
finding
i find that not only am i bound by
t.m
. but i agree with its
reasoning and similarly conclude that ss. 42(5)(a) and 42(2)(p) violate
ss. 15
and
7
of the
charter
. the crown did not argue the provisions are
justified by s.1.
i therefore strike down s. 42(5)(a) and delete 6-month limitation in
s. 42(2)(p).

justice cidalia c.g. faria
this section of the
criminal code
(
cc)
was repealed in an act to amend
the
criminal code
in relation to sexual offences against the person and
to amend certain other acts in relation thereto or in consequence thereof, s.c.
1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 8.  however, since this offence was committed in
1974, this was the provision of the
cc
that was in force at the relevant
time. while the
ycja
only came into effect in 2002, s. 158 requires that
the young person be sentenced pursuant to the
ycja,
despite that the
offence was committed before the
ycja’
s enactment.
