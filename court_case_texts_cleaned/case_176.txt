c.a. brannagan j.:
1
.
christopher russell and charmaine jolicoeur
were intimate partners for more than a decade. they had four children together,
each of whom is currently under the age of 10. mr. russell and ms. jolicoeur
separated in october of 2018.
2
.
on
february 28,
2020
, mr. russell entered into a s. 810 recognizance in relation to ms. jolicoeur
for a period of 12 months. he was required by court order to not have any
contact or communication with her, and he was to remain 100m away from her.
3
.
on august 11, 2020, mr. russell is
alleged to have breached the bond by violating the non-communication and
remain-away conditions. he is now charged with a single count of breaching a
recognizance, contrary to
s. 811
of the
criminal code of canada
. the
trial of this matter is scheduled to be heard before me on october 9, 2025.
4
.
the crown applies for an order for ms.
jolicoeur to testify in the trial against her former intimate partner by way of
cctv, pursuant to s. 486.2(2), while in the company of a support person,
pursuant to s. 486.1(2). the crown submits that these testimonial aids would
facilitate her ability to provide a full and candid account of the acts
complained of.
5
.
mr. russell opposes the use of testimonial
aids for ms. jolicoeur. he asks that i order her to testify at this trial
in-person. he resists the crown’s application on two bases:
i.
mr. russell submits that there is no objective
evidence on this application that can assist the court in determining whether
the testimony of ms. jolicoeur will be facilitated by use of the testimonial
aids sought by the crown; and,
ii.
if the court opines that a testimonial
aid would facilitate ms. jolicoeur’s ability to testify, the applicant has
failed to show why testifying behind a privacy screen (which is unopposed), rather
than by cctv, would be insufficient.
issues
6
.
the issues are twofold:
i.
whether the complainant should be
permitted to make use of the testimonial aids provided for under ss. 486.1(2)
and 486.2(2); and,
ii.
whether the applicant must demonstrate
that a privacy screen would be insufficient before the court may consider the
testimonial aid of cctv.
evidence on the crown’s application
7
.
the evidentiary basis for the crown’s application
consists of two affidavits from two persons involved in the criminal justice
system – a victim witness services worker (“vwsw”), and a police officer with
the barrie police service (“bps”).
8
.
none of ms. jolicoeur, the vwsw, or the
police officer testified at the application hearing held before me on august
11, 2025. while
viva voce
testimony may be heard on the s. 486.2(2)
application, it is not required; rather, it is a discretionary call that may be
made by the presiding justice: s. 486.2(4). there is no similar provision for
s. 486.1(2). in any event, i made no such order in this case.
the vwsw affidavit
9
.
the first of the two affidavits
submitted by the crown is a 12-paragraph document from lianne rivet who affirmed
that she has been a vwsw for 18 years. she is the vwsw assigned to ms. jolicoeur’s
case.
10
.
ms. rivet spoke with
charmaine jolicoeur about testifying in
court and the use of testimonial aids on april 11, 2025. during this
conversation, ms. rivet observed ms. jolicoeur’s voice to be “quivering, and
she was very emotional”. the following points emerge from that conversation,
which i have determined to be relevant:
i.
that ms. jolicoeur would
pass out if in the same room as mr. russell;
ii.
that she is
triggered when she hears his name, when she is talking about him and especially
when in his presence;
iii.
that testifying in
the same room as mr. russell will cause her to have a panic attack, rendering
her unable to answer questions or remain focused; and,
iv.
that she
is very intimidated by mr. russell, and fears retaliation from him, stating
that she is significantly impacted by what he has done in the past.
11
.
ms. jolicoeur requests to testify from
outside of the courtroom by cctv, with a support person – either her mother or
step-mother.
12
.
she does not wish to testify behind a
screen inside the courtroom because of her concerns about being in mr.
russell’s physical presence which, she says, will adversely impact upon her
ability to tell the court what happened to her.
the bps affidavit
13
.
the second affidavit submitted by the
crown is a 10-paragraph sworn document from officer allport, a member of the bps,
and an assisting officer in the case.
14
.
his affidavit offers some limited context
to the case. he tells the court that the parties were in a 12-year common-law
relationship, the demise of which resulted in mr. russell entering into the s. 810
peace bond that is central to this litigation.
15
.
officer allport swears that on august
11, 2020, ms. jolicoeur reported to the bps that the respondent had breached
the non-communication and non-attend conditions of that bond by attending at
her residence on three different dates. he notes that “the victim was fearful
of her safety, which prompted her to report the incidents.”
16
.
his affidavit further advises that he
spoke with ms. jolicoeur on june 20, 2025, concerning mr. russell’s upcoming
trial. i view the following point
as
being relevant for my consideration on this application:
i.
she expressed that her physiological
response to the possibility of testifying in the presence of mr. russell was
profuse sweating and a panic attack.
testimonial aids under
sections 486.1(2), support person & 486.2(2), cctv
17
.
section 486.1(2),
support person –
other witnesses
, provides:
in
any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice may, on application of
the prosecutor in respect of a witness, or on application of a witness, order
that a support person of the witness’ choice be permitted to be present and to
be close to the witness while the witness testifies if the judge or justice is
of the opinion that the order would facilitate the giving of a full and candid
account by the witness of the acts complained of or would otherwise be in the
interest of the proper administration of justice.
18
.
in s. 486.1(3), parliament has
enumerated seven different factors for the application judge to consider in
determining whether to make an order under s. 486.1(2).
19
.
subsection 486.1(4) generally restricts
the support person from being a witness in the proceeding, while subsection
486.1(5) provides the presiding justice with the discretion of ordering that
the support person and the witness not communicate with one another during the
witness’ testimony.
20
.
section 486.2(2),
testimony outside
court room – other witnesses
, provides:
despite section 650, in
any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice may, on application of
the prosecutor in respect of a witness, or on application of a witness, order
that the witness testify outside the court room or behind a screen or other
device that would allow the witness not to see the accused if the judge or
justice is of the opinion that the order would facilitate the giving of a full
and candid account by the witness of the acts complained of or would otherwise
be in the interest of the proper administration of justice.
21
.
parliament has enumerated several non-exhaustive
factors in s. 486.2(3) for the presiding justice to consider in determining an
application under s. 486.2(2). but for subsections (f) and (f.1) – which are
not relevant to this proceeding – the remaining factors in s. 486.2(3) [cctv]
are the same as those found in s. 486.1(3) [support person]. the enumerated
factors are:
(a)
the
age of the witness;
(b)
the
witness’ mental or physical disabilities, if any;
(c)
the
nature of the offence;
(d)
the
nature of any relationship between the witness and the accused;
(e)
whether
the witness needs the order for their security or to protect them from
intimidation or retaliation;
[factors (f) and (f.1) omitted as irrelevant to this witness]
(g)
society’s
interest in encouraging the reporting of offences and the participation of
victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process; and
(h)
any
other factor that the judge or justice considers relevant.
issue #1: whether the complainant should
be permitted to make use of the testimonial aids provisions under ss. 486.1(2)
and 486.2(2)
22
.
the objective of the judicial process is
the attainment of truth. that process must be a fair one, reflecting both the
rights of an accused and those of society. it must enable the trier of fact to
“get at the truth and properly and fairly dispose of the case”, while ensuring
that the defendant retains the opportunity to make a full defence:
r. v.
levogiannis
,
1993 canlii 47 (scc)
,
, 4 s.c.r. 475
, at para.

.
the
canadian victims bill of rights
23
.
the
canadian victims bill
of rights
was
enacted
in recognition of the harmful impact that crime has on victims and society, to
ensure that victims’ rights are considered throughout the criminal process and,
inter alia
, in recognition that consideration of victims’ rights is in
the interest of the proper administration of justice:
canadian victims bill
of rights, s.c. 2015, c. 13, s. 2
(“cvbr”)
, at preamble;
interpretation
act
, r.s.c., 1985, c. i-21, s. 13.
24
.
in canada, victims
are
guaranteed the right to request testimonial aids when appearing as a witness in
a criminal proceeding. that right is to be exercised through the mechanisms
provided by law:
cvbr
, at
ss. 13
and
19(1)
.
25
.
the rules of evidence and
criminal procedure have evolved through the years to accommodate the
truth-seeking functions of the courts. the testimonial aids provisions are
tailored to achieve that end, providing the mechanisms through which the
evidence of victims may be facilitated:
levogiannis,
supra
,
at
paras. 20, 21, 24.
26
.
in enacting the
cvbr
in 2015,
parliament relaxed the test found in both ss. 486.1(2) and 486.2(2) from one where
the court had to form the opinion that the order was “
necessary
to
obtain a full and candid account from the witness of the acts complained of”,
to one where it must form the opinion that the order “
would facilitate
the giving of a full and candid account by the witness of the acts complained
of
or would otherwise be in the interest of the proper administration of
justice
” [emphases added].
27
.
the supreme court of canada has
interpreted the phrase “proper administration of justice” to include “specific
fundamental values such as the ability of courts to control their own process
in furtherance of the rule of law”, while providing an “intelligible standard …
according to which the judiciary [could] exercise the discretion conferred”:
r.
v. hall
,
2002 scc 64
, at para.
103
, citing to
cbc v. new brunswick
,
1996 canlii 184 (scc)
,
3 s.c.r. 480
, at paras. 36-43, and 59
, respectively.
when the testimonial supports provisions
may be relied upon
28
.
the testimonial supports provided for in
ss. 486.1(2) and 486.2(2) “permit accommodation of vulnerable witnesses who may
experience mental or emotional distress if compelled to testify in open court and/or
in the presence of the accused”:
r. v. j.l.k.
,
2023 bcca 87
, at para.
30
;
r. v. arevalo
,
2025 onsc 3851
, at para.
15
.
29
.
it is uncontroversial that the
testimonial aids provisions do not require any measure of exceptionality for their
invocation:
levogiannis
,
supra
, at para. 34;
r. v. blake
,
2019 onsc 6026
, at para.
20
;
r. v. j.s.
,
2023 onsc 1599
, at para.
27
.
30
.
all that is required is the court’s
assessment of whether, in its opinion, the testimonial aid in question would
facilitate the witness’ ability to provide a full and candid account of the
acts complained of, or that use of the testimonial aid would be in the interest
of the proper administration of justice.
31
.
the evidence in support of the
application must have “some reasonable relevance to the necessity requirement
of the statute”, which can allow the judicial officer to formulate the required
opinion referred to in the applicable subsection:
r. v. p.m.
,
1990 canlii 6643 (on ca)
,
o.j. no. 2313 (c.a.)
, at para.
17
.
32
.
the test for ordering a testimonial aid
is not an onerous one, it is simply one that must be met on the civil standard
of proof, that is, a balance of probabilities:
r. v. j.d
.,
2022 onsc 2540
, at para.
14
.
33
.
the decision to make an order under the testimonial aids
provisions is at the discretion of the application judge:
r.
v. allen
,
o.j. no. 1353 (ct. jus.)
, at para. 13
.
34
.
the respondent takes the view
that the two affidavits filed by the crown in support of its application cannot
assist this court in determining whether ms. jolicoeur’s testimony would be
facilitated by her testifying from outside the courtroom via cctv.
35
.
the respondent’s main objection
concerning these affidavits is that their contents speak to the complainant’s
subjective
state of mind, and that the crown has not presented any
objective
evidence in support of its application.
36
.
however, evidence in support of
these types of applications need not take any particular form and judges may
consider, among other things, the nature of the allegations and the
circumstances of the case:
levogiannis
,
supra
, at para. 34; ss.
486.1(3)(c) and (d) and 486.2(3)(c) and (d).
37
.
expert evidence is not required
on an application such as this, and hearsay evidence is admissible:
j.d.
,
supra
, at para.
12
.
38
.
in my view, the vwsw and bps affidavits
offer sufficient evidence that is reasonably relevant to my ability to
formulate the required opinion under ss. 486.1(2) and 486.2(2).
39
.
i also accept, pursuant to
levogiannis
and the factors enumerated within ss. 486.1(3) and 486.2(3), that the
nature of the allegations (an alleged breach of a recognizance in the context
of an intimate partner relationship) and the circumstances of the case (that the
alleged breaches occurred multiple times, within less than six months of the
bond’s imposition) may inform the exercise of my discretion.
section 810 recognizance in an intimate
partner context
40
.
ms. jolicoeur seeks the use of
testimonial aids in the context of an alleged breach of a s. 810 peace bond. during
oral submissions, i asked the litigants if i could consider whether the court
that ordered the bond must have accepted that ms. jolicoeur was possessed of a
reasonable fear of mr. russell for that order to have issued.
41
.
in response, the applicant submitted
that i could take notice of the fact that the issuing court must have accepted
that ms. jolicoeur actually feared mr. russell, and that her fear was
reasonably based. the applicant’s position is that, in these types of
applications, the subjective mind of the complainant is very relevant.
42
.
for the respondent, counsel submitted
that he assisted mr. russell in voluntarily entering into the bond on
february 28, 2020. he said that at that
time his client made no admission as to criminal or civil liability. counsel urged
me not to consider the subjective
fear of ms. jolicoeur as described on
this application, or in relation to the peace bond, submitting that her alleged
fear is not objectively ascertainable in either case.
43
.
having considered both positions, i am
of the view that for the s. 810 recognizance to have issued, the issuing court must
have been satisfied that ms. jolicoeur had reasonable grounds to fear that mr.
russell would cause personal injury to her, or to her intimate partner, or to her
child, or would cause damage to property.
44
.
it is immaterial whether the respondent
chose not to show cause and entered the bond of his own free will to avoid the potentially
more consequential outcome of a criminal trial, or if the crown was put to task
in showing cause — in either case the result is the same, in that the issuing court
must have been satisfied that the requisite grounds existed for mr. russell to
enter into the recognizance.
45
.
the lack of any acknowledgment of
criminal or civil liability by mr. russell in entering into the bond is an
altogether separate and distinct analytical issue from the issuing court’s conclusion
that
ms. jolicoeur’s fear of mr. russell was reasonably grounded
.
46
.
as already noted, much objection was
made by the respondent about the complainant’s concerns being subjective in
nature. however, her subjective fear is an inherent consideration in both the
testimonial aids provisions, and in s. 810.
47
.
for a s. 810 recognizance to issue, s.
810(1) requires the court to consider the complainant’s actual fear of the
defendant (the
subjective
component), while s. 810(3) requires the court
to assess whether those fears are reasonably grounded (the
objective
component) before it may order the defendant to enter into the recognizance:
r.
v. soungie
,
2003 abpc 121 (canlii)
,
a.j. no. 899 (alt. p.c.)
, at para.
12
,
citing
r. v.
banks
,
1995 canlii 5974 (sk kb)
,
4 w.w.r. 698 (sask. c.a.)
.
48
.
the requirement of reasonable grounds
for the complainant’s fear lends
objectivity
to her
subjective
apprehension
of fear. it connotes a reasonably-based sense of apprehension about a future
event:
r. v. budreo
(2000)
2000 canlii 5628 (on ca)
,
46 o.r. (3d) 481 (c.a.)
, at para.
52
.
only where the court is satisfied that
both the subjective and objective conditions are met can it legally require the
defendant to enter into a recognizance.
49
.
as to the testimonial aids provisions at
issue here, ss. 486.1(3) and 486.2(3) require the court to consider several enumerated
objective
factors that are specific to the individual witness who seeks
use of the testimonial aid: (a) the age of the witness; (b) the witness’ mental
or physical disabilities, if any; (c) the nature of the offence (which presupposes
consideration of the witness’s role in it), (d) the nature of any relationship
between the witness and the accused; (e) whether the witness needs the order
for their security or to protect them from intimidation or retaliation; etc.
50
.
for a court hearing a testimonial aid
application, there is no question that it must consider these enumerated
objective
factors as they
subjectively
relate to the specific, individual witness
who seeks to invoke the relevant provision(s), based on the evidentiary record
before it.
51
.
on balance, considering the nature of
the offence, the long-standing intimate partner relationship between the
parties, and society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of offences and
the participation of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system, i am
satisfied that the evidence on this application allows me to form the opinion
that ms. jolicoeur is a witness who may experience mental or emotional distress
if compelled to testify in open court and/or in the presence of the accused.
52
.
it is also telling that, five and
one-half years after mr. russell entered into the recognizance, ms. jolicoeur
indicates that she remains fearful of him.
53
.
i therefore agree with the applicant
that charmaine jolicoeur should be permitted to make use of the testimonial supports
provisions under ss. 486.1(2) and 486.2(2).
issue #2: whether the applicant must demonstrate
that a privacy screen would be insufficient before the court may consider cctv
as a testimonial aid
54
.
the respondent submits that, should the court
find that a testimonial aid would facilitate ms. jolicoeur’s ability to testify
at this trial, testifying in-court behind a privacy screen would be appropriate,
and the crown has failed to establish that a screen would insufficiently
address the complainant’s concerns.
55
.
to be clear, the respondent does not
oppose the complainant testifying in-court behind a privacy screen, while the
applicant and the complainant do oppose it.
56
.
boiled down
to essentials, mr. russell submits that ms. jolicoeur should testify behind a
screen, as opposed to by cctv, because her being physically located inside the
courtroom would be preferable for reasons of trial fairness and credibility
assessment.
trial fairness
57
.
to the former point, the right in canada
to confront a witness in a criminal trial exists as “a qualified right and can
be subject to exceptions designed to achieve some valid purpose in the
administration of justice.” moreover, “the right to face one's accusers in this
day and age is not to be taken in the literal sense. it is simply the right of
an accused to be present in court, to hear the case against him and to make
answer and defence to it”:
allen
,
supra
, at para. 27, citing to
r.
v. levogiannis
(1990),
1990 canlii 11023 (on ca)
,
62 c.c.c. (3d) 59 (ont. c.a.)
and
r. v. r(m.e.)
(1989),
1989 canlii 7212 (ns ca)
,
49 c.c.c. (3d) 475 (n.s. s.c.)
.
58
.
in response to the submission that it is
necessary for a central witness to testify from inside the courtroom, it has
been held that: “justice is not a place; it is a service. all parties do not
have to walk through the courthouse door for a criminal trial to take place. a
fair adjudicative process can still occur, when appropriate, with a principal
witness testifying via videoconference”:
arevalo
,
supra
, at para.
19
.
59
.
nor does s. 486.2(2) require the witness
to be physically present at the courthouse where the trial is taking place:
r.
v. ross
,
2024 onsc 4077
, at para.
9
.
witness
credibility
60
.
to the latter point, that an issue of
witness credibility exists in a given case is an incomplete answer to the
question of whether a witness should be permitted to make use of the various
testimonial aids available under s. 486.2(2), since the “credibility of
witnesses is almost always a factor in trials to some degree”:
r. v.
mapp-farouk
,
2020 onsc 5040
, at para.
23
.
61
.
it is also now commonplace for courts to
receive evidence by videoconferencing technologies, including from complainants
who are providing central and contested evidence:
r. v. brooks,
2020
oncj 692
, at paras.
9-10
;
r. v. o’dea
,
2021 onsc 3706
, at paras.
17
,
20-21;
r. v. husbands
,
2018 onsc 6831
, at para. 16
.
statutory interpretation: no sequential
paramountcy of testimonial aids
62
.
a plain reading of s. 486.2(2) does not
evince of any hierarchy or sequential paramountcy of testimonial aids. the
wording does not provide that one form of support be rejected before another
may be applied for and considered by the court.
63
.
again, for ease of reference, s.
486.2(2) states:
despite
section 650, in any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice may
[…] order that the witness testify
outside the court room
or
behind a screen
or
other device
that
would allow the witness not to see the accused if the judge or justice is of
the opinion that the order would facilitate the giving of a full and candid
account by the witness of the acts complained of or would otherwise be in the
interest of the proper administration of justice [emphases added].
64
.
as the provision plainly reads, the available options for
testimonial supports are disjunctively, rather than conjunctively, associated. the
‘associated words rule’ (
noscitur a sociis
)
should be invoked in such
instances; that is, where two or more terms are linked by “and” or “or”, rules
of statutory interpretation require that “the terms draw their colour from each
other”:
r. v. ali
,
2019 onca 1006
, at para.
69
.
65
.
this rule requires that “a term or an expression should not
be interpreted without taking the surrounding terms into account. the meaning
of a term is revealed by its association with other terms: it is known by its
associates”:
r. v. ali
,
2018 onsc 2838
, at para.
61
, citing to
opitz
v. wrzesnewskyj
,
2012 scc 55
, at paras.
40-41
.
66
.
read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the s. 486.2(2) testimonial
aids provision, its object and parliament’s intention in legislating it, the terms
“outside the court room”, or “behind a screen”, or “other device” found in that
provision draw their meaning from each another, connoting a menu of options
available to the party who seeks to invoke the provision: see
rizzo &
rizzo shoes ltd. (re)
,
1998 canlii 837 (scc)
,
1 s.c.r. 27
, at para.
21
, for driedger’s
‘modern principle’ of statutory interpretation.
67
.
again, there is nothing within either the plain meaning or the
statutory construction of s. 486.2(2) that requires the exhaustion of one testimonial
aid option over another before the next may be considered. had parliament
intended any kind of sequential paramountcy of testimonial supports, we must presume
that parliament would have made clear such an intention; in this case, such an interpretation
can be neither expressly nor impliedly assumed.
68
.
the threshold consideration for testifying
via cctv is no different from, nor more stringent than, the threshold for a
witness to testify behind a privacy screen. the test for both is the same; that
is, whether “the justice is of the opinion that the order would facilitate the
giving of a full and candid account by the witness of the acts complained of or
would otherwise be in the interest of the proper administration of justice”.
69
.
simply stated, in-court testimony behind
a privacy screen and out-of-court testimony via cctv are “equal alternatives”:
j.d.
,
supra
, at para.
6
.
conclusion
70
.
the crown applies for an order from this
court for ms. jolicoeur to testify from the victim witness assistance program
(“vwap”) office in the courthouse via cctv, in the company of a support person
of her choosing.

on this record, i am satisfied that the
psychological and physiological distress that ms. jolicoeur may suffer if
required to testify inside the courtroom, in the presence of mr. russell, is
such that she may invoke the testimonial supports provided for under s.
486.2(2).
72
.
i also find that testifying in the
company of a support person of her choosing may further facilitate ms.
jolicoeur’s ability to testify against her former intimate partner.
73
.
accordingly, i allow the crown’s
application as pleaded and permit charmaine jolicoeur to testify at this trial
from the vwap office in the courthouse via cctv, such that she is
not required to see christopher russell during
the giving of her testimony.

.
ms. jolicoeur
may also testify in the presence of a support person of her choosing, subject
to the following caveats: (1) that person shall not be a witness to this
proceeding; and (2) ms. jolicoeur and her support person shall not be permitted
to communicate during the giving of her evidence.

the rivet affidavit makes mention of mr.
russell being associated to “bikers”. the respondent specifically rejects this allegation,
and i give no weight to the suggestion. i focus, instead, on the complainant’s psychological
and physiological aspects, as communicated through the affidavit.
several
paragraphs in the affidavit discuss the possibility of the complainant
testifying from her home. in oral submissions, i asked the crown whether it was
applying for the complainant to testify from her home or from the courthouse.
the crown confirmed that its application was to have her testify from the
courthouse only. additionally, i have disregarded from the allport affidavit
any mention of mr. russell’s alleged associations, choosing to focus, instead,
on the complainant’s stated psychological and physiological issues, as communicated
through the affidavit.
pursuant to
s. 2
of the
criminal
code
, the term “victim” includes a person against whom an offence has been
committed, or is alleged to have been committed. the court’s use of this term
does not detract in any way from the presumption of innocence that mr. russell
continues to enjoy in this proceeding.
it is noteworthy that in the case of
peace bond applications, the applicant/informant bears the onus to establish
that the defendant should be required to enter into the bond, while the
standard of proof is the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities:
r. v. budreo
(2000)
2000 canlii 5628 (on ca)
,
46 o.r. (3d) 481 (c.a.)
. the onus and standard of
proof on both the testimonial aids application, and a peace bond application,
are the same.
