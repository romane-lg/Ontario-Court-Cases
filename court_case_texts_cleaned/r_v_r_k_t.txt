procedural overview
on january 22, 2024, r.k.t.
pleaded guilty to five counts of voyeurism, five counts of publish voyeuristic
recordings and one count of breaching a release order. on that date, r.k.t. acknowledged
that the facts contained in the agreed statement of facts were true and
accurate.
r.k.t. answered all the plea inquiry questions in a way that satisfied me that
he was entering guilty pleas voluntarily, unequivocally and in an informed
manner.
after these guilty
pleas, r.k.t. took steps to resile from these pleas, including discharging his
lawyer. after many months, r.k.t. eventually retained mr. rinas, who then
proceeded to schedule dates for an application to strike some of his guilty
pleas. however, in advance of the date scheduled to hear this application, mr.
rinas received instructions from r.k.t. to abandon the application and on
february 3, 2025, r.k.t. confirmed on the record that he wished to abandon the
application to strike his guilty pleas.
on february 20, 2025, r.k.t.
stood by his decision to plead guilty on january 22, 2024, by once again
confirming that the facts admitted in the agreed statement of facts were
accurate and true.
on february 20, 2025,
and april 1, 2025, i heard sentencing submissions, and the following exhibits
were filed:

on may 7, 2025, i was
prepared to sentence r.k.t. on that date, four of the victims were present in
person, with two family members supporting them. t.h. and others also attended
virtually on zoom. on that date, mr. rinas, on behalf of r.k.t., asked for an adjournment
given the instructions he had just received regarding a new possible application
by r.k.t. to strike some of his guilty pleas. mr. rinas made arrangements for r.k.t.
to meet with a senior defence counsel.
over the next few
months, r.k.t. retained new counsel and new dates were set in october and
november of this year for a second application to strike some of his guilty
pleas. eventually, new counsel was removed from the record and r.k.t. has been
proceeding without counsel since then.
on today’s date, r.k.t.
abandoned his application to strike some of his guilty pleas and acknowledged
that his guilty pleas were voluntary, unequivocal and informed. he advised that
he was prepared to be sentenced today (october 24, 2025).
facts and circumstances of the offences
prior
related convictions
while i am not re-sentencing r.k.t. for the offences
for which he was previously found guilty by justice k. campbell [see
r. v.
r.k.t.
,
2023 onsc 1826
] and sentenced on march 14, 2024 [see
r. v.
r.k.t.
,
2024 onsc 1897
, hereinafter
r.k.t.-sentencing
], it is
helpful to understand the facts and circumstances of these offences to provide
additional context for the sentencing of r.k.t. for the offences before me.
r.k.t. was found guilty by justice campbell of the
following offences that were committed between january 1, 2015 and july 13,
2019:
1.
voyeurism
2.
possession of child pornography
3.
make child pornography; and
4.
distribute child pornography.
the full details
of these offences can be found in the trial and sentencing reasons of justice
campbell.
essentially, r.k.t. was found guilty of surreptitiously video recording
his younger step-sister while she was disrobed and in various states of undress
in the bathroom of his own residence and in the bathroom of his mother’s
residence. these recordings were made by r.k.t. using a hidden device to record
video. at least one of these recordings was made when his step-sister was under
the age of 18.
subsequently, these video recordings were posted to various
pornographic websites that were dedicated, at least in part, to ‘hidden camera’
videos of naked or partially naked individuals. while justice campbell accepted
that r.k.t. may not have personally posted the videos, he concluded that r.k.t.
provided the recordings to others who posted them. r.k.t. was found guilty of sharing
information, including video clips and a link to the pornographic websites, with
at least one other person, his cousin.
overview of
agreed facts
between 2016 and 2023, r.k.t. set up hidden video recording devices in
the homes and vacation home of the five victims in this case. over this period,
r.k.t. surreptitiously recorded the victims, creating videos that captured the
victims in various states of undress. he then published these voyeuristic, intimate
images on cyber-exploitation websites.
at the time of his offending behaviour, r.k.t. lived with his wife, s.m.
and his young daughter at their home in whitby.
k.h. and t.h.
k.h. is a friend of r.k.t.’s wife, with whom she has worked for many
years. t.h. is her adult daughter. they lived at an address in toronto. k.h., t.h.
and r.k.t.’s family regularly socialized together.
between september 11, 2018 and december 31, 2018, r.k.t. was working
as a security guard. at that time, because she trusted r.k.t., k.h. allowed r.k.t.
to use her washroom when he was working night shifts. unbeknownst to k.h. and
t.h., r.k.t. took advantage of this trust and installed a hidden video recording
device in the bathroom of their home.
this device recorded both k.h. and t.h. at different times, changing
and in various states of undress.
on february 27, 2023, while on bail for his previous set of charges,
r.k.t. posted videos and photos of both women on the cyber exploitation
websites
club.creep
and
motherless.com
, which were dedicated to
the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. these images were made
available to paid members of the sites. the full names of t.m. and k.h., lifted
from their facebook profiles, were published alongside the voyeuristic, intimate
images.
following these invasive posts, t.h. started receiving messages on
facebook asking if she wanted to sell more nude photos.
s.m.
on november 22, 2019, r.k.t. was released on his previous set of
charges, with his wife, s.m., acting as his surety.
between january 2018 and december 31, 2019, r.k.t. set up a hidden
recording device in their shared bedroom, which recorded intimate images of s.m.,
in a state of undress.
on february 27, 2023, while on bail for his previous set of charges,
r.k.t. posted voyeuristic, intimate videos of his wife on
club.creep
with her first name posted in a photo collage showing her face. these videos
were accessible to paid members of the site.
d.m. and a.m.
d.m. is r.k.t.’s mother-in-law, who owns a family trailer in a
campground in keene, ontario. this trailer was a vacation property that
functioned as a gathering place for the extended family, including a.m., r.k.t.’s
sister-in-law.
between january 1, 2016 and december 31, 2019, r.k.t. set up a
hidden recording device in the family trailer. this device captured a.m. and d.m.,
at different times, in various states of undress.
subsequently, on an unknown date, r.k.t. posted these images on
xhamster.com
,
another cyber exploitation website dedicated to the non-consensual distribution
of intimate images. these videos may have been available to anyone who visited
the site.
offence:
failing to comply with his release order
r.k.t. was arrested for the offences that were ultimately tried
before justice campbell. r.k.t. was eventually released on a bail order
requiring that he not volunteer or seek employment at any organization where
children are likely to be.
on may 17, 2023, when r.k.t. was arrested and charged with the
offences that are before me, he was working at the mcdonald’s restaurant at 222
bayly st. west in ajax, ontario. this mcdonald’s has a ‘play place’ area for
children to play and it was clear that children frequented the restaurant.
working at this restaurant was a violation of one of the terms of his release
order.
steps taken
by r.k.t. to obstruct the police investigation
within days of learning that police had linked r.k.t. to the pseudonym
“jayden walsh 33” and the posting of intimate images, r.k.t. took steps to destroy
evidence by performing a manual reset on his cellphone.
impact on victims
the victim impact statements filed in this
case were read in court by the victims themselves. during this process, it was
clear to me how significantly r.k.t.’s actions continue to impact each woman. several
of the victims sobbed as they delivered their statements.
k.h.
k.h. has experienced long-lasting impacts due to r.k.t.’s criminal
actions. as she noted in her vis:
since this
crime, i have had a lot of issues with using any public washrooms. i don’t
trust using
anyone’s washroom. i
still can’t even use my own washroom without
feeling weird by covering the vent with a towel, and still, it doesn’t
make me feel any safer. i used to entertain in my home quite a bit, but i no
longer can do that, as i can’t trust anyone in my home now.
the breach of trust has particularly affected k.h.’s life:
do you have any idea the mental anguish my family and i have had to
endure from someone i trusted to be in my home while he sabotaged my privacy? i
blame myself everyday and the fact that i can’t do anything to make this go
away.
t.h.
as t.h. explained in her vis, she now has severe anxiety and
depression ever since discovering the actions of r.k.t. her trust in others,
particularly around washroom use, has been greatly diminished.
the impact of r.k.t.’s offending behaviour has been profound:
[t]his crime has changed my life, forever! things will never be the
same when someone takes your innocence and privacy away from you as if they had
the right to while in my own home. home is supposed to be my safe space.
s.m.
the sense of violation and betrayal by her partner and the father of
their child continues to haunt s.m. the impacts of r.k.t.’s criminal behaviour have
affected all aspects of s.m.’s life. the fact that the voyeurism offence took
place in her home has caused s.m. to not feel safe in her own home.
s.m.’s health has suffered. in addition, her concerns extend to the
other victims, her family and friends:
a woman's body
is never the property of someone else. the word consent exists for a reason. i
was violated in so many ways when i found out a video was taken of me, and i
was completely in a state of undress. my family and friends were also violated,
and this truly breaks my heart. these people are people who mean/meant the
world to me and to have to walk this path alongside them is not easy nor is it
fair.
despite the consequences to her life and to the lives of her loved
ones, s.m. noted that she and the other victims remains strong and resilient:
our bodies are not made for pleasure and are not made for someone
else to violate. we are strong independent women and do not deserve our most intimate
and private moments being recorded and posted onto the internet.
a.m.
as a.m. wrote in her vis, “there are no amount of words that
demonstrate the impact [r.k.t.] had and the destruction he caused”.
a.m. has experienced a significant breach of trust, and the invasion
of privacy and personal violation has left her feeling unsafe. r.k.t.’s actions
have impacted her ability to enjoy her time with family and friends at the trailer:
the
first
weekend
we
returned
to
the
trailer
where
the
videos
were
taken,
we
all
thoroughly
sifted
through
every
room
because
of
the
fear.
ultimately,
if
i
could
be
recorded
in
a
bedroom
in
one
of
my
own
places
of
residence
by
someone
who
i
considered
family,
how
was
anywhere/anyone
else
safe?
i
don’t
have
trust
in
a
lot
of
people
anymore
because
of
this
being
done
by
someone
so
close
to
my
family.
it
has
been
extremely
hard
to
feel
safe
anywhere
knowing
that
my
own
ex
brother
-
in
-
law
did
these
awful
things
to
me,
my
mother,
and
my
sister.
the
world
turned
dark
and
became
an
unsafe
and
unfair
place
to
live
in.
r.k.t.’s criminal conduct has impacted all aspects of a.m.’s life:
i
am
a
victim
of
his.
the
actions
he
willingly
chose
to
do
shifted
my
entire
life.
the
non
-
consensual
recording
and
the
posting
of
the
videos
of
me
online
impacted
me
in
many
ways.
i
had
trouble
eating.
i
couldn’t
sleep
at
night.
after
the
incident,
i
struggled
to
live
a
normal
life
without
anxiety
caused
by
what
he
did.
…
i
am
weighed
down
heavily
with
feelings
of
betrayal
by
a
seemingly
trustworthy
person
as
well
as
having
my
personal
privacy
stolen
from
me
in
what
should
have
been
a
safe
space.
he
violated
me
in
such
a
deep
way
that
i
struggle
now
to
feel
safe
in
any
environment.
…
as if it wasn’t enough to record and keep the videos, he made the
images available to strangers on the internet where they could still exist in
shared them online to strangers on the internet where they could still exist in
downloads. he permanently gave away my personal privacy without consent
and that is something i will live with for
the rest of my life.
d.m.
since learning of r.k.t.’s terrible breach of trust, d.m. has
experienced tears, sleepless nights, anxiety and panic attacks, for which she
has sought professional help.
d.m. is particularly impacted by the breach of trust and violation of
privacy at the trailer, the family’s summer vacation home. as she noted in her
vis:
we have always been a very close family and when it came time to add
a new member, [r.k.t.] became part of our family. this means holidays,
celebrations, and family vacations. we didn’t know what was being done in our
homes right under our noses. the worst part of this was it was done at our
summer vacation home. in more than one room and on more than one occasion. i
guess while we were off enjoying the pool as people should be, [r.k.t.] was in
there committing crimes in our family space. to do this in the privacy of our
own home is despicable.
m.m.
while not a direct victim in this matter, it is clear that m.m., father
of s.m., and husband of d.m., has been deeply impacted by the devastating
consequences his family has experienced.
m.m. explained it this way:
my family has been torn apart by the actions of one person and as
the father figure of my family, i see the hurt caused by the person. i see my
daughter s.m. anguish over the falsehood of her marriage, i see my daughter a.m.
angry in her reaction to the actions of this person…i see my wife’s hurt
knowing that this person hurt us all with no regard for our right to privacy or
right to [live] our lives in peace.
m.m. and his family have been particularly impacted by r.k.t.’s
decision to so horribly, invade the privacy of their summer family home. “a
place that is supposed to be a place for family fun and enjoyment has been
spoiled forever.”
background and circumstances of
r.k.t.
r.k.t. is now 40 years
old, although the offences took place when he was in his thirties.
at the time he
committed the offences before me, r.k.t. had no criminal record.
through his actions,
he has severed ties to his family and friends, leaving him with much reduced
community support. i have reviewed support letters from his mother and a
friend.
r.k.t. had been
together with s.m. for over 20 years when he committed the offences against her
and her family and friends. he shares a 12-year-old daughter with s.m. i expect
any access to their daughter will be the subject of decisions by the child’s
mother and pursuant to future family court orders.
in terms of employment,
r.k.t. had been working as a mobile security supervisor for a security company
since 2018. that job ended when r.k.t. was first charged with criminal offences
against his step-sister, leaving him unable to renew his security licence. he
remained unemployed until he decided to work at mcdonald’s, a decision that
resulted in the fail to comply charge described earlier.
i have reviewed the psychiatric
report of dr. bouskill. in her assessment of r.k.t., dr. bouskill expressed her
concerns about r.k.t.’s lack of forthrightness. he minimized his offending
behaviour towards his step-sister, despite the findings of justice campbell. r.k.t.
also minimized his offending behaviour in relation to the offences before me.
in his interview with
dr. bouskill, r.k.t. claimed that he threw away the recording device he was
using and denied distributing the images online, directly contradicting the
agreed facts he accepted in this sentencing hearing. i appreciate that the
report of dr. bouskill is dated february 19, 2024, and that r.k.t. re-acknowledged
the truth and accuracy of the facts on feb. 20, 2025.
dr. bouskill noted the
following at p. 20 of her report:
r.k.t.
was
polite
and
superficially
cooperative throughout
the
interview.
…his
thought
form
was
logical
and
organized
but
circumstantial
at
times.
he
was
somewhat
concrete
and
found
it
difficult
to
shift
his
thinking
when
presented
with
new
information.
he
struggled
to
reconcile
discrepancies
in
reporting
when
confronted,
instead
steadfastly
denying
the
validity
of
contradictory
reports…r.k.t.
exhibited
limited
insight
into
the
association
between
his
personal
history
and
mental
health
challenges.
he
had
some
insight
regarding
his
current
life
circumstances
and
relationships.
he
tended
to
externalize
responsibility,
minimize
the
impact
of
his
own
behaviour,
and
engage
in
positive
impression
management,
in
keeping
with his history of similar interactions with law enforcement
professionals.
melissa harnett, the
author of the psr dated march 19, 2024, noted at pages 5, 6 and 7 of her
report:
the subject
takes
full
responsibility for taking
videos
of the victims.
he admitted to the purchase
of
devices
and
the
installation
of them in
places
he wished to
capture
the victims
in a
state
of vulnerability. the subject further admitted
how
exciting it
was to gather the
devices
and watch
them. the subject was
able to
explain in
detail
the
process
of
entering the
victim’s private
areas
and setting
up the camera.
despite
this
admittance
of
guilt,
the
subject adamantly
denies that
he uploaded the videos
to
a
public website. he
uploaded
videos to his computer, watched them and
then deleted them.
he
advises that he threw his phone
away and someone may
have
found
his phone
and
uploaded the videos
online. when asked why
he
completed a
factory reset
prior to
being
arrested, he replied
by saying he
felt it was time to complete this task anyway.
…
the subject
adamantly
denies his full
involvement in this offence. he takes
partial responsibility for taking videos
of
the victims without their
knowledge. contrary to
his
denial
in
the initial
pre-sentence
report
the subject
now
admits
his involvement
in that
offence. he reported regular
use
of pornography and denies that any of it
is illegal.
the subject presumes very little responsibility for the offence,
while partially blaming a stranger. the subject’s motivation for denying
aspects of the offence is clearly linked to his continued hope for reconciliation
with his ex-wife. he has expressed his willingness to attend and actively
participate in any counselling that is required of him by the court
so that he can return to a
“normal life with his
family”
. he
presented as self-confident and complacent when interviewed for this report.
like dr. bouskill’s
report, the pre-sentence report would have been prepared almost a year prior to
r.k.t. re-confirming the truth and accuracy of the agreed statement of facts on
february 20, 2025.
while r.k.t. did not
recall much about his childhood, r.k.t. recalled feeling safe with and loved by
his mother.
r.k.t. claimed that he had
a longstanding pornography addiction since about age 17. he asserted to dr.
bouskill that he developed an interest in voyeurism in 2017.
r.k.t. advised dr.
bouskill that he has struggled with panic and anxiety since he was very young.
when he was 16, he briefly tried and then stopped using anti-depressant
medication.
when speaking with dr.
bouskill, r.k.t. alleged that he was sexually abused at around age eight at the
hands of an older cousin. this cousin is now deceased. he also claimed that
when he was younger than eight, he was touched sexually on one occasion by his
aunt’s boyfriend.
r.k.t. denied any
specific symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.
according to dr. bouskill, r.k.t.’s primary
mental health difficulty is voyeuristic disorder.
this disorder
includes
the
presence
of
recurrent
and
intense
sexual
arousal
from
observing
an unsuspecting
person
who
is
naked,
in
the
process
of
disrobing,
or
engaging
in
sexual
activity,
as
manifested
by
fantasies,
urges
or
behaviours
lasting
over
a
period
of
at
least
six
months.
dr. bouskill opined at
p. 25 of her report:
r.k.t.’s risk for violence, including
sexual violence is considered to be moderate low based on the composite risk
category of moderate low. his risk is driven predominantly by his untreated
paraphilic disorder (voyeuristic disorder),
the impact of
its symptoms on his thinking and behaviour,
the absence of insight into its nature, impact on risk, and
the
need
for
treatment.
if
r.k.t.
were
to
reoffend
it
would
likely
be
sexual
in
nature, characterized
by
opportunistic
targeting
through
voyeurism
of
an
unsuspecting
female
(adolescent or
adult),
or
otherwise
non-contact
offence
as
he
has
in
the
past.
unfortunately,
going
forward, there
is
little
evidence
that
r.k.t.
will
independently
address
these
risk
factors,
or
behave differently,
with
respect
to
how
he
responds
to
and
manages
the
stress
he
encounters
in
his
life
and
as a result of the untreated illness.
at page 26 of her
report, dr. bouskill further commented on r.k.t.’s risk:
subsequent
charges
related
to
voyeurism
and
breach
of
conditions
suggest
r.k.t.
had
not responded
to
the
limited
behavioural
interventions
available,
including
restrictions
imposed
by
the court.
as
such,
the
frequency
of
occurrences
and
potential
severity
of
harm
both
present
moderate risks.
historical
indicators
of
risk
would
include
a
history
of
increased
libido,
voyeurism,
and possession,
creation,
and
distribution
of
child
pornography.
pedophilic
sexual
interests
cannot
be ruled out.
r.k.t.'s
ongoing
discrepancies
in
reporting
posed
a
challenge
in
performing
a
comprehensive
clinical
assessment.
r.k.t.
is
a
difficult
historian,
in
that
his
reports
were
often
inconsistent
with
previously
agreed
facts
or
findings
of
the
court
and
demonstrated
little
ability
to
resolve
these
discrepancies
in
a
logical
way.
he
additionally
provided
autobiographical
details
of
his
life
which
were
extremely
difficult
to
corroborate
(i.e.
history
of
childhood
sexual
abuse
without
disclosure
prior
to
his
2019
arrest).
regarding
child
pornography,
it
is
hard
to
estimate
the
degree
to
which
his
behaviour
is
escalating,
due
to
his
limited
criminal
and
psychiatric
history
and
resistance
to disclose or even discuss possible
pedophilic sexual interests.
finally, dr. bouskill, at

position of the parties
ms. boehr, on behalf of
the crown, sought a global penitentiary sentence of 12 years less pre-sentence
custody (psc), plus the following ancillary orders:
1)
an order requiring
r.k.t. to provide a sample of his dna for the national
dna databank, with all eleven offences being secondary-designated offences; and
2)
a no contact order
pursuant to
s. 743.21
of the
criminal code
for all five victims as well
as m.m., with an agreed upon exception related to s.m.
ms. boehr highlighted
the egregious nature of r.k.t.’s offences, including the serious breach of
trust, the repeated violations of the privacy of five victims over several
years, and the devastating impact of r.k.t.’s behaviour on the victims and
their families.
mr. rinas, on behalf of
r.k.t., asked me to impose a global jail sentence of 4 years and 3 months, less
338 actual days of psc, which should be credited as 507 days, using the usual
summers
1.5:1 basis. this would leave an additional 34.3 months or 1,043 days left to
serve.  mr. rinas took no issue with the ancillary orders sought by the crown.
while fairly acknowledging
the many aggravating factors in this case, mr. rinas pointed to the mitigating
factors including r.k.t.’s lack of a criminal record at the time of the
offences, the programs r.k.t. has completed while in the custody, and the role r.k.t.’s
untreated paraphilic disorder played in his offending behaviour.
principles of sentencing
the fundamental purpose of any
criminal sentence is to protect society, contribute to respect for the law and
help maintain a just, peaceful, and safe society.
sentencing judges attempt to
achieve this goal by imposing just sanctions that address one or more of the
sentencing objectives enumerated in the
criminal code
, including denunciation,
general and specific deterrence, separation from society where necessary, rehabilitation
and promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgment of
the harm they have caused.
the fundamental principle of
sentencing is to impose a sanction that is proportionate to the gravity of the
offences committed, and the degree of responsibility of the person who
committed them. the totality principle is a particular application of the
general principle of proportionality.
the determination of a just and
appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a
purely mathematical calculation. it involves a variety of factors that are
difficult to define with precision. [
see
r. v. lacasse
,
2015 scc 64
at para.
58]
denunciation and deterrence
this case is among the most egregious examples of voyeurism this
court has seen. after placing hidden devices in his wife’s bedroom, in his
in-law’s summer vacation property and in the bathroom of a trusting family
friend, to record their most intimate moments, he then posted degrading videos
and still images of the five women that his devices captured, on pornographic
websites and included with those images the real names of the victims.
r.k.t. violated the privacy and security of his wife’s home, the h. residence
and the m. family summer home, all locations that should have been places of refuge,
peace and comfort.
significantly, some of the images were posted by r.k.t. while he was
on bail and while he was being tried for similar offences against his young
step-sister, just weeks prior to being found guilty by justice campbell.
in the circumstances of the present case, i find that the primary
sentencing objectives must be denunciation and deterrence. i adopt the language
used by justice campbell in
r.k.t.–sentencing
at para. 36: “this criminal
conduct clearly, and grossly, violated the [five victims’] personal autonomy,
dignity, privacy and sexual integrity”. r.k.t. treated these women – who were
his family and close family friends – as sexual objects whose trust he
exploited over time.
rehabilitation
prioritizing denunciation and
deterrence does not mean that rehabilitation can be ignored, nor does it mean
that proportionality in sentencing is no longer an applicable principle.
sentencing is a highly individualized process and particular circumstances
relating to blameworthiness, prospects for rehabilitation and the like must
always be taken into account. this is particularly true where an accused, such
as r.k.t., had no criminal record at the time he committed the offences.
restraint
principle
sections 718.2
(d) and
(e) of the
criminal code
require me to consider the principle of
restraint when sentencing r.k.t.
the court of appeal has repeatedly
emphasized the critical role that the restraint principle plays when sentencing
a first-time offender. in applying the restraint principle, sentencing judges
“should seek the least intrusive sentence and the least quantum which will
achieve the overall purpose of being an appropriate and just sanction”. [

i must consider imposing
consecutive sentences for offences that do not arise out of the same event or
series of events and for sentences that were committed while an offender was on
judicial interim release. [see s. 718.3(4)(b) of the
criminal code
]
when deciding whether a sentence should be served
consecutively or concurrently, i must consider the principle of totality and
ensure that the combined sentence is not unduly long or harsh. [see s. 718.2(c)
of the
criminal code

relevant
sentencing ranges
sentencing
range – voyeurism
voyeurism offences
under
section 162
of the
criminal code
allows for a maximum jail sentence
of 5 years when proceeded by indictment, as the crown has proceeded in this
case.
as the cases provided
by mr. rinas and ms. boehr demonstrate, there is a wide range of sentences
given in voyeurism cases. of course, this variance reflects the wide range of
facts and circumstances that can constitute the offence, as well as the unique
personal circumstances of each offender. in addition, most offenders in reported
decisions have been sentenced for other offences at the same time as the
voyeurism offence, meaning totality is often a factor.
an example on the low
end is a decision of justice henschel, when she was on
the ontario court of
justice, in
r. v. dowran
,
2024 oncj 341
, where the first-time offender
was given a four-month jail sentence and probation. mr. dowran used his
cellphone to record five up-the-skirt videos of strangers, including a
16-year-old girl, and one video of his airbnb tenant, which he filmed through a
window from outside of the unit.
at the high end is the
sentence imposed by justice campbell in
r.k.t.–sentencing,
which involved
r.k.t. using a hidden camera installed in the bathroom of his own home and in the
bathroom of his mother’s home, r.k.t. recorded nude or partially nude video images
of his step-sister, with at least one video having been made when the victim
was 15 or 16 years old. unlike the case before me, r.k.t. was not found to be
the person who posted the images on pornographic websites, although he was
found to have shared the images with r.k.t.’s cousin. for the voyeurism offence,
justice campbell sentenced r.k.t. to 3.5 years in custody, as part of a global sentence
of 5.5 years. there was only one victim, not five as in the present case, but because
the victim was under 18 for at least one of the surreptitious recordings, r.k.t.
was also found guilty of the related child pornography offences. no victim was
under 18 in the case before me.
sentencing range – distribution of intimate images
the sentencing cases involving
offences committed under
s. 162(4)
of the
criminal code
, or pursuant to
the similar offence under
s. 162.1
, suggest a similarly wide range of sentences.
at the low end of the cases
provided by counsel, a 5-month jail sentence was given to an offender who posted
five videos depicting his former intimate partner engaged in sexual intercourse
on two pornographic websites. [see
r. v. a.c.
,
2017 oncj 317
(rahman
j.)
] unlike in the present case, the videos posted by the offender
in
a.c.
were
obtained consensually.
it appears that most of the
reported cases where an offender distributed or posted intimate images involve
an offender posting or sharing images that were consensually obtained but distributed
without consent at the break-up of the relationship. for those cases, where an
offender vengefully posts or shares intimate images of an identifiable complainant,
the range of sentence is in the mid to upper
reformatory range. [

r. v. weedon
,
2023 oncj 317
(r. wadden j.) at
para.

aggravating and mitigating factors
in determining an appropriate
sentence, it is necessary to consider any relevant aggravating or mitigating
circumstances.
aggravating factors
i will start with the
aggravating factors:
(1)
breach of trust: the
victims were close family – his wife, his mother-in-law, his sister-in-law –
and close family friends. it is aggravating that r.k.t. flagrantly breached
that relationship of trust.  indeed, section 718.2(a)(ii) of the
criminal
code
recognizes the seriousness of committing an offence on an intimate
partner or family member by making this context an aggravating factor.
(2)
the inclusion of the
victims’ names: the level of humiliation and intrusion into the private lives
of the victims was aggravated by r.k.t.’s inclusion of their actual names with his
posts of the intimate images.
(3)
permanency: the
intimate images of the victims, having been shared online by r.k.t., are now
permanently existing on the internet.
(4)
persistent nature: it
is aggravating that r.k.t. repeatedly, over years, violated the privacy of the
victims.
(5)
violation of
safety/security of the home: it is extremely aggravating that r.k.t. invaded
the safety and security of the victims’ homes to install a device to observe
them in their most vulnerable moments, in order to obtain intimate images of
them.
(6)
planned and organized: r.k.t.
took steps to set up his scheme by installing hidden recording devices and
ensuring he had a mechanism to access the images. this scheme included using a
ruse with k.h. to gain access to her bathroom.
(7)
impact on victims: as i
have already summarized, r.k.t.’s actions have had profound and devastating impacts
on the victims and their families.
(8)
offences committed
while on release order: it is very aggravating that r.k.t. continued to
re-offend even as he faced similar charges before the superior court. as the
agreed facts make clear, r.k.t. continued to post voyeuristic, degrading images
online even after he was released on bail on november 22, 2019. indeed, r.k.t. continued
to surreptitiously record and post intimate images of his wife while she was
acting as his surety at the time.
i have considered the specific facts of the breach offence in count 5 – working
at mcdonald’s where r.k.t. knew children were likely to be – as an aggravating
factor on sentence given that i intend to impose a concurrent jail sentence for
this offence. [
see
r. v. fortune
,
2024 onca 269
at para.
33]
(9)
attempt to conceal his behaviour: it is aggravating that upon
learning that police had identified him as the perpetrator, r.k.t. deleted the
contents of his phone in an attempt to cover his tracks.
mitigating factors
i now turn to the
mitigating factors, which include the following:
(1)
no criminal record: while
r.k.t. now has a criminal record and is currently serving a sentence, at the
time he committed the offences, he had no prior involvement in the criminal
justice system.
(2)
family support: r.k.t.
has some family support in the community. for example, he proposes to live with
his mother and step-father upon his eventual release from custody.
(3)
guilty plea: while this
has been a protracted guilty plea, i have considered r.k.t.’s guilty plea as a
mitigating factor, given that no victim has had to testify, and no trial time has
been set aside for this case.
i should note, however, that i remain concerned about r.k.t.’s ability or
willingness to appreciate the full extent of the trauma he has caused. his insight
into his offending behaviour remains limited. he has tended to minimize his
offending behaviour when given opportunities to discuss his criminal conduct.
even in his handwritten plan of release (exhibit 12), r.k.t. asserted that he
had not offended since 2018. this is inconsistent with the agreed facts that r.k.t.
has accepted as true and accurate.
(4)
psychiatric report: i
take into account the contents of dr. bouskill’s report, including r.k.t.’s
psychiatric diagnoses.
(5)
conditions of psc: i have considered the restrictive
conditions in which r.k.t. has served his pre-sentence custody, including the
impact of partial and full lockdowns on him, as a mitigating factor on
sentence. [see
r. v. avansi
,
2023 onca 547
at paras.
7-9
;
r. v.
marshall
,
2021 onca 344
at para.
52]
appropriate sentence
given the gravity of r.k.t.’s
offending behaviour, a substantial global penitentiary sentence is necessary to
send a strong denunciatory message to express society’s abhorrence of r.k.t.’s
predatory conduct. it must communicate to r.k.t. and others who choose to
violate the trust of family and friends to invade their privacy and humiliate
them, that they will face serious consequences.
i find that the
facts of this case fall at the high end of the scale in terms of intrusive and
degrading behaviour for these offences.  a sentence in the range proposed by
mr. rinas would be inadequate and would not be
proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed and the degree of
responsibility of r.k.t.
when i consider
the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, and the relevant
sentencing principles, an exemplary, global sentence approaching the amount
sought by the crown is not out of the range in the circumstances of this case
and this offender.
that being said,
when i consider r.k.t.’s guilty pleas and his lack of a criminal record at the
time he committed the offences, and the fact that r.k.t. committed the offences
prior to being diagnosed with a paraphilic disorder and before treatment was
made available to him, i find that a global sentence of 9.5 years properly
reflects the principles of totality and restraint.
further, given
that the sentence i will be imposing will be served consecutively to the
sentence r.k.t. is already serving, i will reduce the sentence by an additional
one year, to 8.5 years, to ensure the global sentence is not crushing, while
still reflecting r.k.t.’s moral blameworthiness and providing some protection
for society.
such a
denunciatory penitentiary sentence should bring home to r.k.t. and to members
of the public that perpetrators of such flagrant and degrading abuse of trust will
face severe consequences.
sentence imposed
r.k.t., please stand. i am
sentencing you to serve 8.5 years (or 3,102 days) in the penitentiary, less the
psc you have already served prior to starting your current sentence. this will
be noted as 338 actual days credited as 507 days pursuant to
r. v.
summers
,
2014 scc 26
. this leaves 2595 days or 85.3 months or just over 7
years remaining.
[for my calculations, i am using 30.417 days per
month, a calculation that has been approved of by our court of appeal
in
r.
v. chung
,
2021 onca 188
at para.
185
.]
this global sentence should be
reflected in the following breakdown (consecutive counts
underlined
):
on count 1
(voyeurism – k.h.), i sentence you to 18 months jail,
consecutive to the sentence you are currently serving.
the 507 days of psc should be credited on
this count, leaving 40 days jail remaining. [calculation: 18 months = 547 days less
507 days = 40 days jail]
on count 2 (voyeurism – t.h.), i sentence
you to 18 months jail concurrent to all other sentences
on count 3
(voyeurism distribute – k.h.), i sentence you to 12
months jail, consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are
currently serving
on count 4
(voyeurism distribute – t.h.), i sentence you to 12
months jail, consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are
currently serving.
on count 5 (fail to comply with release
order), i am sentencing you to 6 months jail concurrent to all other sentences.
on count 6
(voyeurism – s.m.), i sentence you to 18 months jail,
consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are currently
serving.
on count 7
(voyeurism – d.m.), i sentence you to 18 months jail,
consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are currently
serving.
on count 8 (voyeurism – a.m.), i sentence
you to 18 months jail, concurrent to all other sentences.
on count 9
(voyeurism distribute – s.m.), i sentence you to 12
months jail, consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are
currently serving.
on count 10
(voyeurism distribute – d.m.), i sentence you to 12
months jail, consecutive to all other sentences, including the sentence you are
currently serving.
on count 11 (voyeurism distribute – a.m.),
i sentence you to 12 months jail, concurrent to all other sentences.
ancillary orders
in addition to the penitentiary
sentence, i make the following ancillary orders:
section 743.21 order
r.k.t., i am making an order
pursuant to
s. 743.21
of the
criminal code
prohibiting you from having
any contact or communication, direct or indirect, with the following:
-
k.h.
-
t.h.
-
d.m.
-
a.m.
-
m.m.
-
s.m., except pursuant to a family court
order dated after today’s date or through family court mediator rebecca craig
or her designate. [note: this exception only applies to s.m.]
dna order
in addition, r.k.t., i order that
you provide samples of bodily substances reasonably required for the purpose of
forensic dna analysis to be used in accordance with the dna identification act.
this will be done in the courthouse today, before you are transported
elsewhere. all offences are secondary-designated offences.
victim fine surcharge (vfs)
finally, considering that i am
sentencing you to a lengthy period of custody, i am waiving the vfs.
r.k.t., you have
committed grave offences for which you must serve your time in custody. i hope
that while serving your sentence you take advantage of the programming made
available to you to better equip you for your eventual release back into the
community.
i wish you well.
