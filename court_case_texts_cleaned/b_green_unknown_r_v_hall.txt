application
renwick j.:
introduction
the defendant faces one count of having an
excess blood alcohol concentration within two hours of operating a motor
vehicle.
the defendant was arrested on 11 june 2023. the
information was sworn 28 june 2023. the defendant’s trial was set to take place
today and tomorrow (09-10 april 2025). the trial was apparently adjourned by
another judge on 20 march 2025 to permit the prosecution to respond to the late
filing of this application (17 march 2025). the parties agree that the global post-charge
delay until the original anticipated completion of the defendant’s trial is 653
days or 21 months and 14 days.
this application is brought because the
defendant asserts that his constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable
period of time will have been breached by the date that this trial was
originally set to conclude. the prosecution does not seek to rely on any
exceptional circumstance to justify any delay and professes timeliness and all
appropriate alacrity.
there are few facts in dispute between the
parties. the parties agree on the calculation of the total delay and the
applicable law. at issue are deductions for defence delay and any apportionment
of responsibility for the trial date that was set.
i have also considered whether this application
is ripe for determination: the new trial date has not been set, the total gross
delay is unknown. i have taken into account that i have heard full argument and
i am in a position to determine the application, as it is currently framed,
today.
governing
jurisprudence
in
r
. v.
jordan
, the supreme court
of canada held that trials in provincial courts ought to complete within 18
months.
the first step under the
jordan
analysis
is to determine the total length of time between the date when the defendant
was charged and the completion of his trial.
the next step is to subtract from the total delay any time periods which are
“attributable to the defence.”
if the net delay remains above the appropriate
ceiling:
…then the
delay is presumptively unreasonable. to rebut this presumption, the crown must
establish the presence of exceptional circumstances. if it cannot, the delay is
unreasonable and a stay will follow.
if, after subtracting defence delay, the net
delay is below the 18-month ceiling:
…then the onus
is on the defence to show that the delay is unreasonable. to do so, the defence
must establish that (1) it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
effort to expedite the proceedings,
and
(2) the case took markedly
longer than it reasonably should have. …stays beneath the ceiling [will] be
rare, and limited to clear cases.
[emphasis in the original.]
what is “defence delay?” time periods that may
be deducted from the total delay are those “where the defence conduct has “
solely
or directly
” caused the delay.”
that said, not all delay caused by the defence
should be counted as defence delay. our supreme court clarified the definition
of “defence delay” in
r.
v
. cody
:
in
setting the presumptive ceilings, this court recognized that an accused
person's right to make full answer and defence requires that the defence be
permitted time to prepare and present its case. to this end, the presumptive
ceilings of 30 months and 18 months have "already accounted for [the]
procedural requirements" of an accused person's
case (
jordan
,
at para.
65
; see also paras. 53 and 83). for this reason, "defence actions
legitimately taken to respond to the charges fall outside the ambit of defence
delay" and should not be deducted (
jordan
, at
para.
65
).
the
only deductible defence delay under this component is, therefore, that which:
(1) is solely or directly caused by the accused person; and (2) flows from
defence action that is illegitimate insomuch as it is not taken to respond to
the charges. as we said
in
jordan
, the most
straightforward example is "[d]eliberate and calculated defence tactics
aimed at causing delay, which include frivolous applications and requests"
(
jordan
, at para.
63
). similarly, where the court
and crown are ready to proceed, but the defence is not, the resulting delay
should also be deducted (
jordan
, at para.
64
). these
examples were, however, just that -- examples. they were not
stated in
jordan
, nor should they be taken now, as exhaustively
defining deductible defence delay. again, as was made clear
in
jordan
, it remains "open to trial judges to find that
other defence actions or conduct have caused delay" warranting a deduction
(para. 64).
…
defence
conduct encompasses both substance and procedure -- the decision to take a
step,
as well as the manner in which it is conducted
,
may attract scrutiny. to determine whether defence action is legitimately taken
to respond to the charges, the circumstances surrounding the action or conduct
may therefore be considered. the overall number, strength, importance,
proximity to the
jordan
ceilings, compliance with
any notice or filing requirements and timeliness of defence applications may be
relevant considerations. irrespective of its merit, a defence action may be
deemed not legitimate in the context of a s. 11(
b
)
application if it is designed to delay or if it exhibits marked inefficiency or
marked indifference toward delay.
as
well, inaction may amount to defence conduct that is not legitimate (
jordan
, at paras.
113 and 121
). illegitimacy may extend to
omissions as well as acts (see, for example in another context,
r. v. dixon
,
1998 canlii 805 (scc)
, 1 s.c.r. 244
, at para.
37
). accused persons must bear in mind that a
corollary of the s. 11(
b
) right "to be tried
within a reasonable time" is the responsibility to avoid causing
unreasonable delay. defence counsel are therefore expected to "actively
advanc[e] their clients' right to a trial within a reasonable time,
collaborat[e] with crown counsel when appropriate and ... us[e] court time
efficiently" (
jordan
, at para.
138
).
in
r.
v.
mallozzi
, our court of appeal confirmed that
actions that are legitimately taken to respond to the charges will fall outside
of defence delay and will not be subtracted from the total delay.
however, legitimate
defence action may still reduce overall delay if not taken in a timely way, or
if the manner of proceeding has led to delay.
the
calculation of defence delay is no longer simply a matter of measuring the time
between refused and accepted trial dates. our court of appeal has rejected this
approach in favour of a contextual approach that considers the circumstances
relevant to whether, in respect of a particular period of time, the defence
refusal of a date is the “sole or direct” cause of the resulting delay.
the supreme court has confirmed that courts are entitled to apportion responsibility
for delay among the litigants.
in
j.f
., in the context of delay calculation when a re-trial is ordered,
the supreme court affirmed the requirement of all parties to take a
prospective
approach to delay.
analysis
a.
the total delay
it is agreed that the total delay for this case is 653 days or 21 months and 14 days.
b.
the
net delay
defence delay is to be subtracted from the total delay to arrive
at the net delay. defence delay can arise in two different ways.
the first component is delay resulting from clear and unequivocal
waiver of the defendant’s s. 11(b) right. the parties agree that there has been
no explicitly waived periods of delay by the defendant in this matter.
the second component is delay caused solely by the conduct of the
defence. this includes periods when the prosecution and the court were prepared
to proceed and a defendant was not.
the defendant accepts 35 days of delay that occurred during the
period after the judicial pre-trial (held 29 february 2024) until the trial
scheduling meeting occurred. this was a reasonable concession: on 06 march
2024, agent for counsel of record (not counsel who argued this application),
indicated that a trial scheduling meeting would be held, “later this week.”
that did not occur. in fact, on the subsequent court appearance (20 march 2024),
inexplicably, no one appeared. eventually, the trial scheduling meeting was
held on 11 april 2024.
subtracting 35 days from gross delay leaves 618 days or 20 months
and 10 days of delay.
c.
additional
delay
the prosecution seeks the attribution of further defence delay as
a remedy for the late filing of this application and no prior notice of an
intention to bring a s. 11(b) application. following several provincial court
authorities, the prosecution seeks some apportionment of defence delay in the period
from the setting of the trial date until what was (until recently) the
anticipated completion of the trial.
when pressed during oral submissions, the prosecutor (like counsel for the
applicant) was reluctant to give a precise apportionment of responsibility for
the 12 months from the trial set date (11 april 2024), until the putative trial
completion date (tomorrow).
the defendant accepts that it did not give written or formal
notice of its s. 11(b)
charter
concerns until the filing of this application
on 17 march 2025. however, the defendant submits that the defence conduct
always signalled an intention to rely upon s. 11(b) of the
charter
. this
was demonstrated by the speed with which matters were moved ahead, the
willingness of the defendant to conduct a crown pre-trial meeting (11 january
2024) even before disclosure (the qualified technician’s breath sampling
procedure and prisoner cells videos) was completed, and the ready acceptance of
the first trial dates offered (15-16 may 2024), which were rejected by the
prosecution.
pursuant to the directions of higher courts, i
have tried to take a wholistic view of the conduct of the parties both before
and after setting this matter down for trial. when considered from an
atmospheric view, i find that some delay is appropriately attributed to the
defendant.
i accept that there were disclosure issues that
prevented this matter from moving forward until late january 2024 (some seven
months post-charge). during the fifth court appearance on 31 january 2024, counsel’s
agent sought a three-week adjournment to review “the recent video disclosure”
and to schedule a judicial pre-trial.
however, the defendant, through counsel, was not
blameless for all delay until the matter was set down for trial. on 21 february
2024, counsel’s agent sought a two-week adjournment due to counsel’s
unavailability (conducting a homicide trial). further, there is the delay
(accepted by the defendant) from 06 march until 11 april 2024 in holding the
trial scheduling meeting, despite representations made on 06 march.
i mention these delays not to assign blame, but
to acknowledge that any message sent to the prosecution, on the basis of counsel’s
conduct, would have been mixed.
i also find that efforts to assert the defendant’s
s. 11(b) right were lacking. there are no emails or letters, there were no
comments on the record (during any of the defendants nine court appearances), there
is no indication on either the trial time estimate form (completed before the
trial scheduling meeting), or the trial scheduling form itself, that s. 11(b)
was to be litigated.
the defendant asserts that there was some
discussion about s. 11(b) during the trial scheduling meeting, which is
accepted by the court, for the purposes of this argument. however, without any
context or other evidence, it is almost meaningless. did the defendant put the
prosecution on notice that s. 11(b)
charter
concerns were going to be
raised? did counsel advise that instructions would be needed from the defendant,
but if positive, the prosecution could expect to litigate a s. 11(b)
application? in the absence of a more complete record, it is inappropriate to give
this fact much weight.
i find that the late notice of this application runs
afoul the supreme court’s direction in
r
. v.
j.f
.:
the predictability of the new
framework makes the partie
s
more accountable and encourages
them
to be proactive about delay (
jordan
, at para.
112
;
r. v. cody
,
2017 scc 31
,
1 s.c.r. 659
, at para.
36
). in the case of the
crown, the prospective approach clarifies the content of its constitutional
obligation to bring the accused to trial within a reasonable time (
jordan
, at para.
112
).
as for the accused
,
the predictability provided by
the new framework requires that
they
be an active part of the solution to the problem of delay in criminal
cases
(
jordan
, at paras.
84-86 and 113
).
[emphasis added]
there can be no doubt that the defendant cannot
sit idly by while delay mounts:
an accused who sees delay
lengthening must therefore respond in a proactive manner. being proactive may
mean filing a s. 11(b) motion where the accused believes that their right to be
tried within a reasonable time is not being or will not be respected (jordan,
at para.
85
). like any other application made by an accused, a motion of this
kind must be brought "reasonably and expeditiously" (para. 85).
lateness in raising delay is contrary to the proper administration of justice,
because such a practice serves to waste judicial resources.
…
in short, a duty to act
proactively also rests on the accused. as a result, the accused must indicate
that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has not been respected
and, where the circumstances require, bring a motion for a stay of proceedings
in a timely manner. as a general rule, this means before the trial is held. by
the time the trial dates are set, the parties are generally in a position to
know whether the trial delay will exceed the applicable presumptive ceiling,
and the defence can raise any concerns it may have.
the majority decision in
j.f.
uses the
word “proactive” or “proactively” no less than 18 times in 80 paragraphs. the
message is clear: all parties (which includes a defendant) must act proactively
to avoid unreasonable delay in the conduct of a criminal prosecution. that
includes putting the other side and the court on reasonable notice of an
intention to bring a s. 11(b) application.
i also find that by failing to formally raise s.
11(b) as an issue either in writing or on the record during court proceedings, the
defendant deprived the prosecution of an opportunity to remedy the situation.
this failing is especially significant in this
jurisdiction where there was a successful backlog-reduction initiative in the
fall of 2024 which invited defendants with s. 11(b) concerns to court to
attempt to move their trials to earlier dates.
situations like this were anticipated. in fact, the
chief justice of this court created a practice direction to avoid them. that
practice direction became effective 01 november 2023. on that date, her worship
(now regional senior justice of the peace) s. burton advised the parties (during
the third appearance) of the new practice direction given the disclosure
difficulties some four months post-charge. among other things, that practice
direction also requires:
…
2.
unless the court directs otherwise, section 11(b) applications shall be
heard at least four months before trial, to allow the scheduled trial dates to
be utilized for other matters should the proceedings be stayed.
3.
section 11(b) applications will be scheduled at the same time the trial
is set. to facilitate this procedure:
i.
s. 11(b) applications will be canvassed during judicial pre-trials and
the defence (counsel, authorized agent or accused, if self-represented) is
required to advise the pre-trial judge if they intend to bring a s. 11(b)
application; and
ii.
s. 11(b) applications will be canvassed when trial dates are canvassed
in the trial scheduling court or in the trial coordinator’s office. if the
trial date is more than 18 months from the information sworn date, a s. 11(b)
application date will be set unless the defence confirms on the record that
they are not bringing a s. 11(b) application.
this procedure applies, with any necessary modifications,
when a trial is adjourned and/or a new trial is being set.
4.
the s. 11(b) notice of application (form 1) and any supporting materials
must be served and filed at least 30 days in advance of the application hearing
date, in accordance with rule 3.1 of the
criminal
rules of the ontario court of justice.
neither the rules nor the practice direction
were followed by this defendant.
i agree with and adopt the words of justice
monahan in
r
. v.
kullab
:
…the
defence was uniquely in the position to say if delay was a problem. simply
because dates were set outside the
jordan
ceiling
would not necessarily signal to the crown that there was a section 11(b)
problem. for example, the defence may have been content with the delay for
whatever reason. accordingly, both the defence and the crown were to blame.
in considering an apportionment of the delay
from 11 april 2024 until 10 april 2024, i have taken the following into
account:
i.
the defendant had been reasonably diligent in
moving the matter along throughout most of the early appearance, pre-trial
process;
ii.
the prosecution took no proactive steps to avoid
delay from the start of the proceedings until the trial was set (it took seven
months for core disclosure to be made available);
iii.
the defendant failed to put the prosecution and
the court on notice of s. 11(b) concerns for 11 months following the setting of
the trial date; and
iv.
a lack of institutional resources was the
largest determinant of the 12-month delay from the setting of the trial until
the trial date, rather than the conduct or inaction of the parties.
accordingly, of the delay from setting the trial to reaching the
trial date, i am prepared to apportion 20% responsibility to the defendant. of
the 365 days from 11 april 2024 until 10 april 2025, the defendant is
responsible for 73 days.
when defence delay is subtracted from the gross delay (653 minus 35,
minus another 73 days), the net delay to trial is 545 days or 17.92 months, which
is marginally below the presumptive
jordan
limit for trials in this
level of court.
the trial will be adjourned
on 20 march 2025, the matter was brought forward from today’s trial
date to discuss the late filing of this application. the presiding judge
granted an order to permit the prosecution to file a late response to this late
application. as well, i am advised that the presiding justice adjourned the
trial and vacated tomorrow as a continuation date to permit the prosecution to respond
to the application without the need to prepare for trial.
today, the parties indicated that they could begin the trial if need
be. that may not change anything, given the time left today and the requirement
of up to two days to complete this trial.
i do not propose to over-rule a prior order of a colleague. this
trial will not begin today. the parties are directed to return to the trial
coordinator’s office to reschedule this two-day trial.
conclusion
the defendant’s s. 11(b)
charter
right to
be tried within a reasonable period of time was not expected to be violated if
the evidence and submissions ended tomorrow, as initially planned. this is the only
time period i have been asked to consider.
my findings and these reasons should not be
interpreted to bind any other court if any future application(s) are brought. however,
future applications should adhere to both the rules and the practice direction
of 01 november 2023.
given that no new trial date is fixed, i do not
consider myself to be seized to hear this matter.
for the reasons above, this application is
dismissed.
