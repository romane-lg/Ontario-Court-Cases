i.
overview
the history of proceedings and reasons for
sentence are as follows:
on september 4, 2025, i found mr. mann guilty of
all offences he was facing relating to a loaded, restricted firearm found inside
a duffel bag inside his home while on a court order not to possess any weapons.
my reasons for judgment were set out in
r. v. mann
,
2025 oncj 457
.
i do not intend to reiterate
my findings here, except as may be required; however, i do rely on them in my
considerations in determining an appropriate sentence and in reaching facts on
any aggravating factors.
on the day judgment was delivered, defence
declined an opportunity to have a pre-sentence report prepared for mr. mann.
crown and defence counsel were encouraged in court and via email to file
submissions, supporting case law, and any other relevant materials in advance
by responding in a “reply-all”.
the matter was adjourned to september 22, 2025,
for further submissions and sentencing. i confirmed on this date that all
materials were now filed and that there was not a change in position of seeking
a pre-sentence report.
the crown filed sentencing materials and a draft
491 forfeiture order on september 12, 2025. the sentencing materials spanned
183 pages and included an affidavit entitled “affidavit of lisa smith - june
27, 2025” (smith affidavit). ms. smith is a criminal intelligence analyst with
peel regional police and was tasked with setting out relevant and detailed
statistical information on illegal firearm possession, their use, and
consequences in peel region since 2014 to 2025
.
on september 16, 2025, the defence filed three
cases for my review.
on september 18, 2025, i responded to all
parties via email advising them that the entire day was tentatively set aside
by the trial-coordinator for mr. mann’s sentencing hearing. as such, i
encouraged all parties to ensure filings are complete, that arrangements should
be made for any potential witnesses on disputed evidence be ready to proceed
either in person or via zoom, and that i am made aware of any further
aggravating or mitigating factors as soon as possible.
however, i made it clear that
i would entertain further adjournments for incomplete materials if so required.
while there was no 11(b) application filed, and
mr. mann’s trial and judgment occurred just under the 18 month
jordan
ceiling,
i am nonetheless mindful of the need to proceed promptly.
the date for sentencing,
september 2, 2025, would be 18 months and 6 days from the swearing of the
information.
on september 22, 2025, all exhibits received to
date were filed including:
(1)
email correspondence between the court and
counsel.
(2)
the smith affidavit
(3)
mr. mann’s institutional records
(4)
letters of support from mr. mann’s wife amarjeet
kaur, and his uncle jagraj singh,
(5)
mr. mann’s work permit issued by immigration,
refugees and citizenship canada (ircc)
(6)
an immigration opinion letter, while not
specific to mr. mann, highlights the consequences of a conviction of any
offence of 10 years or more resulting in a finding of “serious criminality” and
therefore deemed inadmissibility to canada.
ii.
further findings of fact on sentence
at the outset of sentencing, i invited counsel
to make submissions on whether i could conclude that mr. mann was in possession
of the loaded firearm, ammunition, and prohibited device:
(1)
while in a public place.
(2)
while travelling to quebec; and
(3)
while in a motor vehicle.
although evidence was led at trial that could
support findings on these issues, no specific conclusions were made at that
time, as they did not form part of the essential elements of the offences
charged.
at sentencing, i invited counsel to make
submissions or call evidence on any remaining disputed matters before
determining whether these circumstances should be treated as aggravating factors.
i remain bound by the principle that any aggravating factor must be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt.
counsel for the crown did not seek to call any
evidence on any of these aggravating factors but agreed that based upon the
evidentiary record i could make findings provided they are proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.
defence counsel urges the court not to draw
aggravating inferences about possession at goodlife or interprovincial
transport, noting that no witness saw the weapon in the blue bag and that ms.
kaur testified she did not see it.
in assessing the evidence at trial and applying
these findings of fact to the sentencing proceedings, i am satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that mr. mann was in possession of the firearm, ammunition,
and prohibited magazine outside the residence and took them with him on his
work-related trip to quebec.
this finding gives rise to additional
aggravating factors, which i address below. my conclusion is based on the
following facts and inferences that flow naturally from the trial record:
•
although the firearm was not observed until
police discovered it during the search, the evidence supports only one
reasonable conclusion: the firearm was inside the blue duffel bag during mr.
mann’s trip to quebec.
•
ms. kaur testified that the blue duffel bag was
brought with them to quebec. while i do not accept her evidence that she was
unaware of the firearm, her testimony regarding the presence of the bag during
the trip is uncontroversial and corroborated by police observations before and
after the trip.
•
ms. kaur further testified that upon returning
from quebec, she and mr. mann placed their bags in the kitchen and immediately
went upstairs, as mr. mann was feeling unwell. according to her, she gave him
medication and he went to sleep. although i have serious concerns about ms.
kaur’s overall credibility, i accept this specific account as accurate, as
there is no evidence of mr. mann interacting with the bag after returning home.
accordingly, there is no equally competing inference that the firearm was
placed in the bag after the trip. this supports the aggravating factors of
possession in a public place, possession in a commercial motor vehicle, and
interprovincial transport.
however, i am not satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that mr. mann had the firearm with him while at the goodlife gym. the
temporal gap and change in purpose between his possession of the duffel bag at
the gym and his departure for quebec leave uncertainty as to when the firearm
was placed in the bag. while there is a high probability that he had the
firearm and prohibited items with him at all material times led in evidence at trial,
i cannot find the additional aggravating factor that he possessed them in a
highly public setting such as a gym, where they could have been easily accessed
or stolen.
iii.
counts where the principle in
kienapple
applies.
one of the first matters addressed at the
sentencing hearing was what counts, if any, should be stayed pursuant to the
supreme court of canada’s ruling in
r. v. kienapple
as noted above, mr. mann was found guilty of the
following
criminal code of canada
offences:
(1)
possession of a firearm, to wit; a handgun,
knowing that he was not a holder of a licence contrary to section 92(1)
(2)
possession of a restricted firearm with
accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in said firearm without
authorization contrary to section 95(1)
(3)
careless storage of a firearm, to wit: a
handgun, contrary to section 86(1)
(4)
possession of a prohibited device and ammunition
without a licence, to wit: rounds of 9mm ammunition, knowing that he was not
the holder of a licence under which he may possess it contrary to section
92(2); and,
(5)
disobeying a lawful court order, to wit: do not
possess any weapon(s) as defined by the
criminal code
, contrary to
section 127
.
it is agreed that count 1, the section 92(1)
count, should be stayed pursuant to this principle on the basis that this
charge arose out of the same factual and legal circumstances as the more
serious offence of 95(1), or count 2 of the information.
count 4 will remain as the prohibited device
does not relate to the possession of the firearm in counts 1 and 2; rather, it
relates to a prohibited over-capacity magazine used
with
the restricted
handgun. counts 3 and 5 are separate and distinct offences and will also
remain.
iv.
position of the parties
the crown seeks a total sentence of 3.5 years
for the cumulative sentence that may be considered as a total sentence, or as a
breakdown of offences where consecutive sentences apply. in this case, the
breakdown would therefore be 3 years concurrent on the firearm offences, and 6
months consecutive on the breach of court order (consecutive). i advised the
crown that i was inclined to treat the breach of a court order under s.127 as
consecutive sentence. with that, the crown’s view is that the total sentences
should therefore be three years for the firearm offences and six months for the
breach of court order.

,
r.
v. fernandes
,
2025 onsc 4412
, and
r. v. morris
,

,
defence submits the operative range for s. 95 “true crime” possession commonly
spans two to five years but argues this case sits at the low end given the
absence of use to facilitate other criminality and mr. mann’s circumstances as
a first
‑
time offender. defence stresses that the s. 127 common law peace
bond breach should attract less weight than a s. 117 prohibition breach and
highlights the severe immigration consequences (serious criminality and
resulting inadmissibility) as collateral consequences.

at 1.5:1, and seeks

and lockdowns, plus additional credit for 9 months 20 days of strict house

recognition of house

‑
month global sentence (28 months on the firearms, 2 months
consecutive for the s. 127), once
summers
and
duncan
credits are
applied.
both counsel agree that
summers
and
duncan
credit should apply to mr. mann.
v.
the background of mr. mann
through submissions of counsel and the exhibits
on sentencing, i have come to learn the following about mr. mann:
•
mr. mann is 26 years old. he is in canada on a
work permit; he is not a canadian citizen or permanent resident.
•
he is married to amarjeet kaur. prior to these
charges, ms. kaur and mr. mann looked forward to a life “full of hope” but that
shifted  quickly when they lost their baby, presumably a miscarriage, followed
by mr. mann’s arrest shortly thereafter. both have faced immense stress and trauma
over the past couple of years and they now look to the future with anxiety and
pessimism. they faced significant financial challenges while mr. mann was on
bail as he was unable to work. ms. kaur has been residing in british columbia
in an effort to pursue immigration options more favourable to her
circumstances. ms. kaur speaks highly of his character and advises he is “not a
bad person”. she hopes that upon his release, they can rebuild their lives
together.
•
mr. jagraj singh, the uncle of mr. mann, and a
canadian citizen, wrote a letter to the court expressing strong family support
for mr. mann. he describes mr. mann as a kind, respectful, and caring
individual who values family and community, and states that this conviction is
entirely out of character. mr. singh emphasizes the emotional hardship the
process has caused, particularly for mr. mann’s wife, who has experienced
significant stress and depression during his incarceration. he assures the
court that, upon release, the family will provide full support to help mr. mann
reintegrate, secure meaningful work, and move forward positively. the letter
concludes with a plea for mercy and compassion in sentencing, asserting that
mr. mann is a good young man who can rebuild his life with family support.
•
prior to remand, mr. mann spent 9 months and 20
days on strict house arrest with a surety. he was not permitted to work during
that period and was required to reside with his surety. if he was outside of
this residence, he would need to be in the presence of that surety.
•
he has no criminal record.
•
as a result of this conviction, he will most
certainly face deportation. i base this on the immigration opinion filed.
•
mr. mann was afforded the opportunity to address
the court at the completion of sentencing but declined.
vi.
principles of sentencing
in
determining the appropriate sentence, i look to the guiding principles set out
s.718.1
of the
criminal code
. i have also evaluated the case law
submitted by defence and crown.
the
court has a duty not only to sentence individual offenders, but to speak
clearly to the community about how illegal firearm offences are treated.
in
reaching a proportionate sentence, i am mindful to take into account the
mitigating and aggravating factors, and any collateral consequences that may
affect the offender. i am also mindful of the emphasis that denunciation and
deterrence are paramount considerations in offences of this nature. both trial
and appellate courts have repeatedly stressed the harm that gun crime creates in
our community. as a few notable examples:
•
“gun-related crime poses grave danger to canadians."
•
“gun crimes involving the possession of loaded, concealed
firearms in public places pose a real and immediate danger to the public,
especially anyone who interacts with the gun holder. when the person with the
gun is confronted by the police, who are engaged in the lawful execution of
their duties, the risk increases dramatically. it increases yet again when the
gun holder flees, and still again when the gun holder discards the weapon in a
public place. a person who carries a concealed, loaded handgun in public
undermines the community's sense of safety and security. carrying a concealed,
loaded handgun in a public place in canada is antithetical to the canadian
concept of a free and ordered society [citations omitted]”
•
“firearms offences, involving violence, have been decried by all
levels of courts in canada as a scourge on our society. crimes involving
firearms are far too common. firearms are used to seriously injure, maim, or
kill people. the result is that courts have repeatedly emphasized the need for
exemplary sentences.”
•
“gun crime is a matter of grave and growing public concern. guns
are designed to cause serious injury and death. guns such as the one seized in
this case are inherently dangerous and present an ultimate threat of death to
those in their presence. a sawed-off shotgun serves no legitimate purpose. this
is a "true crime" offence. in
r. v. nur
,
2015 scc 15
, the
supreme court of canada emphasized that illegal firearms are primarily found in
the hands of criminals who use them to intimidate, wound, maim and kill.”
•
“gun crime has become a cancer in toronto. despite several years
of case law condemning the offence, the possession of firearms remains a blight
on the city and its residents. guns are made and used to maim, threaten and
kill. their impact goes well beyond the victims of such crime: spouses,
romantic partners, parents and children suffer the trauma of a loved one lost
to the mindless violence wrought by the use of firearms. witnesses to gun
violence may suffer traumatic effects that linger for their lifetime. courts
have sought to send an unambiguous message to those involved in gun crime that
convictions will inevitably bear severe consequences.”
a
valuable curation of similar comments by highly respected jurists and appellate
authority was set out by justice goldstein in
r. v. sampogna,
o.j. no. 692 at para 12
.
despite
these ever-escalating denunciatory messages sent by the court, the smith
affidavit makes it clear that this has had little effect on the willingness of
some individuals to possess illegal firearms and lethal accoutrement in our
communities. mr. mann is one of those people.
while
prevalent in peel region, this problem is not exclusive to it. in the recent
toronto decision of
r. v. hinds
,
justice j. callaghan pointed out that “the rate of police-reported violent
crime involving a firearm increased in 2022 by 8.9%. the 2022 rate of
firearm-related violent crime is at its highest level since comparable data was
first compiled in 2009.”
illegal
firearms, and the horrific violence that routinely flows from their use,
remains a persistent and deeply troubling threat to public safety and in peel
and across canada. courts at all levels have consistently recognized the
gravity of these offences and the urgent need to respond with sentences that
reflect the principles of denunciation, deterrence, and protection of the
public.
it
is hard to know whether this is driven by a sense of indifference, a feeling of
impunity, confidence in concealment, or a sentiment that gun crime is not
treated severely enough to sufficiently deter individuals from possessing them.
i doubt the courts will ever come to sufficiently understand or deter some
individuals’ willingness to commit these crimes despite the most severe of
sentences or while on court orders not to do so.
while
it appears the courts have exhausted efforts of denunciation through strong and
repeated messages, we have not exhausted the tools available to us in
protecting the public from individuals who brazenly carry them in public; and,
in the case of mr. mann, while on court orders prohibited them from doing so.
while
“denunciation and deterrence” under section 718(a) and (b) are paramount
objectives in sentencing gun cases, it does not prevent courts from adding the
same paramountcy towards protecting the public as stated the immediate outset
of
s.718
of the
criminal code
: “the fundamental purpose of sentencing is
to
protect society…
”
in addressing illegal firearms.
similarly,
s.718(c) states “to separate offenders from society, where necessary;” this is
another valuable tool as courts seek to quell the scourge of gun crime in
canada, and more particularly, in the greater toronto area.
the
increase in gun violence and gun possession over the past decade has not gone
unnoticed by the public. canadian media has routinely covered the harm of
illegal gun crime and how it has impacted our communities. those that it impacts
most are often the most vulnerable and impoverished.
while
media reports and news stories on these crimes must be evaluated through a lens
of skepticism that are at times motivated to generate traffic or subscriptions,
it would be obtuse to ignore an overall sentiment that there is an erosion of
public confidence in the sentences that people who are willing to carry illegal
firearms receive.
variances
of sentences in similar cases range from conditional sentence orders,
to upper reformatory,
to penitentiary terms.
while all these cases
aim to achieve a proportionate sentence for the offender, it is undoubtedly difficult
for the public to understand how there is such deviance from the stated baseline:
71        gun crimes involving
the unlawful possession of loaded handguns in public places fall squarely
within that category. mclachlin c.j., in nur (scc), at para. 82,
observed
that a three-year sentence may be appropriate
"for the vast
majority of offences"
under s. 95: see also nur (onca), at para.
206;
r. v. mansingh
,
2017 onca 68
, at para.
24
; r. v. marshall
,
2015 onca 692
, 340 o.a.c. 201, at paras.
47-49
; and
r. v. danvers
(2005),
2005 canlii 30044 (on ca)
, 199 c.c.c. (3d) 490 (ont. c.a.), at para.
77
.
(emphasis added)
where
the supreme court of canada and appellate courts have made it clear that the
“vast majority of cases” involving illegal firearms require significant
custodial sentences, courts should strive to apply this binding authority
consistently. doing so reinforces public confidence in the justice system.
similarly, those who possess illegal firearms should understand that such
conduct will almost certainly result in a substantial custodial sentence,
likely in a penitentiary. regardless of whether these sentences deter or
denounce offenders, they unquestionably protect the public during the period of
incarceration.
vii.
pre-sentence custody:
summers
and
duncan
credit
mr.
mann was first admitted to the maplehurst correctional centre on march 21,
2024, and remained in custody until march 28, 2024, at which point he was
released, presumably on bail. he was subsequently readmitted on january 19,
2025, and has remained in custody since that date.
as
of september 22, 2025, defence and the crown agree he has accrued a total of
256 days of pre-sentence custody.
applying the standard
summers
credit ratio of 1.5:1, this results in an
effective sentence of 384 days, or just over 1 year.
counsel
for mr. mann submitted institutional records detailing the conditions under
which mr. mann served this time. these records are relevant to the question of
whether additional credit, commonly referred to as
duncan
credit, should
be applied considering the conditions he endured.
in
addition to the filed records, and the submissions of counsel, i also rely on
my local knowledge as a presiding justice in peel where mcc serves. to
strengthen that awareness, i am also aware of recent decisions that describe
the ongoing unacceptable conditions within maplehurst.
in
one such recent decision dated september 16, 2025, justice mirza of the
superior court of justice here in peel region stated:
[…] in
r v. duncan
,
2016 onca 754
, the ontario court of appeal agreed that the appropriate
circumstances, particularly harsh presentence incarceration conditions, can
provide mitigation apart from and beyond the one point five credit referred to
in section 719(3.1) of the code. in considering whether any enhanced credit
should be given, the court will consider both the conditions of the
pre-sentence incarceration and the impact of those conditions on the accused.
i can reasonably
infer how hard it has been to be in maplehurst for him over the almost three
years. every judge and justice of the peace in this court routinely hears about
the hardships from frequent lockdowns, triple-bunking, violence and health
concerns at maplehurst.
there is no doubt
that it is an institution that is punishing, at times cruel, and it is not a
suitable setting for any person long-term.
while
i bound to consider harsh conditions, how that affects the ultimate sentence is
a matter of discretion with no fixed formula of what credit i should apply. in
the decision of
r. v. abraham
,
r.s.j. ellies points out the difficulty in trying to reach a specific ratio in
trying to calculate an appropriate amount of
duncan
credit when
evaluating all factors holistically. this is complicated further when
considering a mixed “partial” and “full” lockdown experience, and therefore
“assess[ed] the effect of the lockdown on him qualitatively and to mitigate the
sentence based on that assessment.” that is the same approach i intend to take
in mr. mann’s case by factoring in the entirety of the records and further
amplified by counsel in submissions.
in
making such a consideration, i have considered the records of mr. mann that
demonstrate:
(1)
a total of 109 lockdown days. 48 of those days were full lockdown and 61
were partial lockdowns.
combined, mr. mann served a total of just under 45% of his time in custody in
some form of lock down.
(2)
mr. mann was triple-bunked for a total of 177 days, or 69% of his time
in custody.
(3)
there are no reports of institutional misconduct on file. he was
therefore eligible for full access to privileges. however, that access was
significantly frustrated or negated on lockdown days.
(4)
a list of programming that would have been available to mr. mann on days
he was able to attend but this was presumably seriously undermined or negated
by lockdowns.
(5)
his dietary needs were met. his entitled privileges were still accessible
on “partial” lockdown days. regardless of lockdowns, inmates were still
entitled to shower daily or as operationally feasible.
the
crown agrees to applying
duncan
credit appropriately to reflect the
conditions mr. mann spent his time in custody, but did not take a firm position
on what that means in effect.
defence
counsel pointed out the case of
r. v. beals
,
that provides a helpful reference on how similar conditions were treated by
other judges in this jurisdiction. justice durno in
r. v. andrew
attributed approximately 0.5 days credit for every day spent in lockdown. i
accept this as sensible credit for lockdown days for mr. mann and therefore
credit him 60 days for the prolonged lockdowns at maplehurst.
in
the same case, justice durno gave 9 months of mitigation for 458 days of triple-bunking.
applying the approximate ratio to mr. mann, he is therefore entitled to an
additional 100 days of pre-trial custody under
duncan
principles of
mitigation.
lastly,
i am asked to consider applying
further
duncan
credit for his
strict conditions while on bail awaiting trial. while these conditions pale in
comparison to the mitigation he deserves for his time spent at maplehurst, he
is entitled to some degree of additional mitigation when considering he was
unable to work, had to live away from his spouse, and was not allowed outside
the residence except while in the presence of his surety. therefore, i will
credit mr. mann an additional 1 month for his time spent on house arrest as
further
duncan
credit.
the
total effective pre-sentence custody mr. mann has served is:
(1)
256 days of actual custody × 1.5
summers
credit = 384 days
(2)
+ 60 days credit for lockdown
(3)
+ 100 days credit for triple-bunking
(4)
+ 30 days credit for strict bail conditions
total:
384 + 60 + 100 + 30 =
574 days of enhanced credit.
viii.
the appropriate range
in
r. v. williams
,
justice west provided a helpful analysis of determining an appropriate range
for firearm possession offences by drawing on supreme court and appellate
authority. the judgment identifies several factors relevant to this case that i
will reiterate and adopt here:
(1)
the distinction between “true crime” and regulatory possession under s.
95(1), with the former attracting exemplary custodial sentences, even for
youthful first offenders.
(2)
the paramount importance of denunciation and general deterrence in
sentencing for loaded firearm offences, particularly where the firearm is
possessed in public.
(3)
the starting point for sentencing in “true crime” cases is typically at
or near the maximum reformatory sentence, and often in the penitentiary range,
even for first offenders.
(4)
the range of sentences is informed by appellate decisions such
as
r.
v. nur
, r. v. smickle,
r. v. mansingh,
and
r. v. beals
,
which consistently affirm custodial sentences of two to three and a half years
for possession of prohibited or restricted firearms in “true crime” scenarios.
(5)
the presence of aggravating factors, including possession in a public
place, concealment, proximity to others, and risk to police and community,
significantly increases the seriousness of the offence.
(6)
the absence of a connection to other criminal activity (e.g.,
trafficking or gang involvement) may mitigate the sentence, but does not remove
the offence from the “true crime” category.
(7)
sentencing must remain individualized but must also reflect consistency
and proportionality.
(8)
the impact of systemic racism may be relevant to moral culpability but
does not diminish the gravity of the offence.
(9)
the harsh conditions of pre-sentence custody may be considered as a
mitigating factor, but must not render the sentence disproportionate (paras.
65–72, citing
r. v. duncan
and
r. v. marshall
).
in
r. v. gorgievski
,
justice schreck affirmed that the well-established sentencing range for
first-time firearm possession offences is between two and five years. the
offender’s level of moral culpability determines where within that range a
sentence should fall. where the firearm is possessed in public as a tool of
criminal trade, the culpability is high and sentences tend toward the upper end
of the range. conversely, where the firearm is possessed in private and not for
the purpose of facilitating other criminal activity, a sentence at the lower
end may be appropriate. regardless of context, the moral culpability associated
with possessing a firearm remains significant.
in
this case, the evidentiary record does not clearly establish why mr. mann
possessed the firearm, nor does it show a connection to other criminal
activity. however, this does not diminish the seriousness of the offence. mr.
mann was in possession of a carelessly stored, loaded, restricted firearm,
equipped with a prohibited over-capacity magazine, inside motor
vehicles—including one used for commercial purposes—and transported it across
provincial borders.
these
circumstances are highly aggravating. based on the authorities cited and the
facts of this case, i find that the appropriate starting point for mr. mann’s
sentence on the firearm-related offences is between three and four years. this
range does not include the breach of the court order, which i address
separately below as a consecutive sentence.
ix.
the evidence of firearm offences in peel region
the
smith affidavit provides a comprehensive statistical and contextual overview of
firearm-related violence in peel region from 2011 to 2025. it documents a
sustained and troubling increase in the unlawful possession and use of
handguns, particularly in urban centers such as brampton and mississauga. the
data reveals that most firearm-related homicides in peel involve illegally
possessed handguns, often loaded and concealed, and frequently found in
residential settings. these weapons are not only used in targeted violence but
also contribute to accidental shootings, intimidation, and the destabilization
of communities.
the
affidavit highlights a pattern of increasing accessibility to prohibited
firearms and devices, including over-capacity magazines, which amplify the
lethality of these weapons. it further notes that many of these firearms are
stored or transported in ways that make them readily available for use—often in
bags, vehicles, or shared dwellings—without any lawful purpose. the cumulative
effect of these practices has been a measurable erosion of public safety, with
law enforcement and emergency services reporting a marked rise in
firearm-related incidents, injuries, and fatalities over the past decade.
these
findings underscore the urgent need for courts to respond with clarity and
resolve. the possession of a loaded, prohibited firearm in peel region is not a
neutral act—it is a direct contribution to a documented crisis. the smith
affidavit supports the conclusion that denunciation and deterrence must be
prioritized in sentencing, not only to hold individual offenders accountable
but to affirm the court’s role in protecting the community from the predictable
and often tragic consequences of illegal firearm possession.
the
affidavit provides concrete data to support these conclusions. between 2020 and
2024, peel regional police responded to over 1,200 firearm-related incidents,
with unlawfully possessed handguns comprising more than 85% of all firearms
seized. in 2024 alone, there were 47 shooting-related injuries and 19 confirmed
firearm-related homicides in the region. notably, over-capacity magazines—such
as the one found in mr. mann’s possession—were recovered in 31% of handgun
seizures that year, underscoring their increasing prevalence and the heightened
risk they pose to public safety.
the
affidavit also highlights a troubling rise in residential firearm recoveries,
which have nearly doubled since 2018. these recoveries frequently involve
unsecured, loaded handguns found in shared dwellings, often accessible to
others and stored in bags, closets, or vehicles. the data confirms that such
storage practices are not only unlawful but statistically correlated with both
intentional violence and accidental discharge. these patterns are not
isolated—they reflect a broader and worsening trend in peel region that demands
a sentencing response calibrated to the gravity of the risk and the need for
community protection.
i
am aware that the smith affidavit relates to firearm possession and crime in
peel region, and not waterloo where the firearm was seized, it makes no
difference in any of my assessments of the appropriate range. the investigation
commenced with peel regional police and the firearm was seized by them. as the
crown pointed out, mr. mann is part of the data that is relied upon. the
escalating issue of gun crime, whether viewed from a national, provincial, or
local level, all speaks to the same level of concern and sentencing
principles.
x.
the need for denunciation and general deterrence
in peel region
the
sentencing in this matter must be situated within the broader context of
firearm-related violence in peel region. the statistical and analytical data
contained in the smith affidavit, examined above, paints a stark and troubling
picture. over the past decade, peel region has experienced a sustained and
alarming increase in the possession and use of illegal firearms. the affidavit
documents not only the frequency of such offences, but also their devastating
consequences—fatal shootings, injuries, and the erosion of public safety in
communities across brampton and mississauga.
this
court cannot view mr. mann’s conduct in isolation. the possession of a loaded,
prohibited firearm, with an over-capacity magazine, in a shared residence where
there was a history of volatility, is not merely a regulatory infraction. it is
a direct affront to public safety and a manifestation of the very crisis
described in the smith affidavit. the firearm was not locked away, nor was it
stored in a manner that minimized risk. it was accessible, mobile, and ready
for use—one trigger pull away from grievous harm or death.
in this context, the principles of
denunciation and general deterrence must be given primacy.
the
presence of an over-capacity magazine not only increases the potential
lethality of a firearm—it fundamentally alters the risk calculus for law
enforcement officers tasked with confronting individuals who possess such
weapons unlawfully. police officers are trained and equipped to respond to
threats based on expected levels of force and engagement. when confronted with
a prohibited device capable of discharging significantly more rounds than a
standard magazine, officers are effectively "outpowered" in terms of
their own protective gear and tactical options. this imbalance escalates the
danger of any encounter, increasing the likelihood of reactive force, injury,
or death. the proliferation of such devices contributes to what can only be
described as an arms race between those who unlawfully possess firearms and the
officers sworn to protect the public. courts must recognize this dynamic and
respond with sentences that reflect the heightened risk posed to law
enforcement and the community at large.
while
mr. mann’s firearm was discovered by police in his residence, the evidence
supports the conclusion that he transported it across provincial borders and
kept it in a bag he routinely carried in public. this aggravates the risk and
underscores the need for a sentence that sends a clear and unequivocal message:
the unlawful possession of firearms in peel region will be met with firm and
proportionate custodial sentences.
the
court must not only hold mr. mann accountable, but also contribute to the
broader effort to stem the tide of gun violence in this jurisdiction. anything
less would fail to reflect the gravity of the offence and the court’s
responsibility to protect the community.
xi.
the mitigating factors relating to mr. mann
as
set out in greater detail above at under the background of mr. mann, mitigating
factors include:
•
the
duncan
factors already considered.
•
he has a loving spouse who is supportive of him
and wishes to continue their relationship and presumably continue to attempt to
raise a family together upon his release.
•
at the time of the offence, he was employed and
a contributing member of society while in canada on a work permit.
•
ms. kaur and uncle speak to his otherwise good
character.
•
he has no criminal record.
•
mr. mann and his wife have faced significant
stress since his arrest.
•
he and his wife recently lost a child.
xii.
the aggravating factors relating to mr. mann
to
repeat what is stated above, the breach of the court order (count 5) will be
addressed as separate, consecutive sentence and not considered as an
aggravating factor.
the
aggravating factors are as follows:
•
the firearm was loaded and immediately operable. it was capable
of causing grievous bodily harm or death with a single trigger pull.
•
the firearm was stored in a volatile household, which was
occupied by other individuals and had a documented history of violence, as
described by ms. kaur during her testimony.
•
the firearm was equipped with an extended magazine, which is a
prohibited device. this increases the potential for lethal harm. while a single
bullet may be sufficient to cause death, the presence of an extended magazine
serves no lawful purpose and instead increases the capacity for intimidation
and further violence.
•
for the reasons stated above, i am satisfied, beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused had this firearm and prohibited device with him during
his work trip to quebec. i consider this interprovincial transport an
aggravating factor. i also consider the firearm being present in a motor
vehicle an aggravating factor.
xiii.
collateral consequences
the court of appeal of ontario recently reminded trial judges the
mandatory requirement to consider collateral consequences a sentence may have
upon the offender, their family, and potentially other unintended consequences.
“[c]ollateral consequences humanize and individualize sentencing by accounting
for its effects other than the criminal sanction itself”.
in addition, a court must ask is whether a sentence may
unintentionally undermine some of the objectives of 718.1 such as reintegration
into society, rehabilitation, and therefore reduce the need for denunciation
and deterrence. this issue is often raised in the context of cases where
immigration consequences of deportation may be triggered over relatively small
or arbitrary durations of a sentence. there is no rigid rule in how collateral
consequences are considered as each offender is unique.
in
examining collateral consequences, the court sentencing judge can craft a
proportionate sentence by taking into account all of the relevant circumstances
related to the offence and the offender.
the
fundamental principle is captured well by the supreme court of canada in
r. v.
suter:
48        the question is not whether collateral consequences
diminish the offender's moral blameworthiness or render the offence itself less
serious, but whether the effect of those consequences means that a particular
sentence would have a more significant impact on the offender because of his or
her circumstances. like offenders should be treated alike, and collateral
consequences may mean that an offender is no longer "like" the
others, rendering a given sentence unfit.
however, in cases where an appropriate sentence places an offender
well outside those potential immigration (or other) thresholds, a collateral
issue cannot be used to override the sentence to one that is entirely unfit.
while the court must strive to reach a proportionate sentence by considering
collateral consequences, it must not sacrifice a fit sentence in the process. the
supreme court made this clear in stating:
[t]he fundamental principle of
proportionality must prevail in every case - collateral consequences cannot be
used to reduce a sentence to a point where the sentence becomes
disproportionate to the gravity of the offence or the moral blameworthiness of
the offender.
similarly, when consequences can be expected as a result of the
commission of the offence (as opposed the particular circumstances of the
offender), the weight given to collateral consequences may be reduced.
in assessing collateral
consequences, it is important not to conflate consequences
per se
(such
as incarceration or weapons prohibitions) that is directly linked to the
offence, into an collateral consequence that is unusually or disproportionally
harsh upon the offender before the court. where such inevitable consequences
would flow, a “collateral” consequence as a mitigating factor is greatly
diminished.
i approach this exercise generously and in alignment with what the
supreme court of canada stated in
r. v. suter
and
emphasized again by the ontario court of appeal in
r. v. d.b.
the collateral consequences in this case relate primarily to the
effects this conviction will have upon his immigration. as noted, it seems
certain mr. mann will be deported upon serving his sentence. while i
might be inclined to consider reducing his sentence if there was an
insignificant amount of variance that could change these inevitable immigration
consequences, that is not the case here. any fit and proportionate sentence
will result in the same collateral consequences for mr. mann – namely,
deportation.
i
am aware that there are additional collateral consequences such as the
separation of his wife should she remain in canada. however, i do not accept
that as rendering the sentence disproportionate to the moral culpability of mr.
mann. this is not a case like
r. v. pham
where a otherwise fit sentence creates unintentional or unintended consequences
that are disproportionate to an appropriate punishment. this is a conviction of
serious offence that immigration automatically classifies as one deserving of removal
from canada.
these
are not a
collateral
consequences; they were
inevitable
consequences.
xiv.
the breach of court order and to be served
consecutively
in sentencing on the breach of the court order (count 5), am
cognizant that i can consider this as an aggravating factor; or i can treat
this as a separate offence for which i can sentence on a consecutive basis. i
cannot do both.
i have already stated i intend to do the latter.
following the reasoning in the case of
mccue,
i consider
the breach of the court order to require a consecutive sentence to properly
reflect the gravity of the offence of breaching a court order in such a brazen,
and serious manner:
20        the
mischief conviction warranted a consecutive sentence. that offence was entirely
distinct from the weapons offences. it should have been treated as a separate
and distinct matter for the purposes of sentencing. a concurrent sentence
denigrates the significance of the mischief charge and suggests that it is not
in and of itself worthy of punishment. of course, in fixing the appropriate
length of a consecutive sentence, a trial judge must have regard to the
totality of the sentences to be imposed. totality concerns can, however, be
adequately addressed by adjusting the length of the various consecutive
sentences, if necessary.
this rationale is supported further by paciocco j.a. in
claros
at para 51:
51       more
importantly, the fact that two offences relating to the breach of a prohibition
order occur in close succession, or even at the same time, is not a basis for
imposing concurrent sentences. the principle that such offences should be
served consecutively is intended to ensure that disregard of firearm
prohibition orders, imposed in the interest of public safety, does not go
unpunished. this principle also recognizes the fact that the breach of a
prohibition order is different behaviour than the associated offences, engaging
different social interests:

60.
while the offence mr. mann was found guilty of was not a s.117
prohibition order, i see little, if any, difference in the circumstances.
defence submits that the court should recognize the significant
difference in maximum sentences between a breach of a s.117 prohibition order
and a breach of a common law peace bond under s.127, and that this distinction
should guide sentencing. i do not agree. sentencing is an individualized process,
contingent on the facts of the case.
while s. 117 orders often accompany an underlying criminal record
and a specific firearm prohibition, the starting point for breaches involving
firearms is typically six months. in this case, the facts mirror those
scenarios: the breach involved possession not merely of a weapon, but of a
loaded firearm with ammunition and an over
‑
capacity
magazine. put simply, the seriousness of this breach is such that an
appropriate sentence, standing alone, begins at six months even under
s.127
of
the
criminal code
.
a court made it clear to mr. mann that he was not to possess
any
weapons, and he not only violated that, but in a manner with layers of
intentionality and seriousness – acquiring the firearm, acquiring a prohibited device
to extend its firing power, loading the firearm, possessing it in a public
place, in a motor vehicle, and without any authorization to do so. i list these
factors not to replicate the aggravating factors i have already considered;
rather, to point out that this was not a “technical” or careless breach of a
court order and sentencing him upon this must reflect that.
the appropriate range for breaches of firearm prohibition orders
is between 6-12 months, consecutive. while my inclination would be to treat
this offence in the middle of the range, i will impose a total of six months to
reflect proportionality and align with the crown’s position.
the argument about maximum penalties is therefore academic; in
either case, a fit sentence is six months.
xv.
conclusion and total sentence
i
therefore impose the following sentence:
•
on counts 2, 3, and 4 (firearm-related offences), a sentence of
three (3) years imprisonment, to be served concurrently.
•
on count 5 (breach of court order), a sentence of six (6) months
imprisonment, to be served consecutively.
•
pursuant to
s. 109(3)
of the
criminal code
, mr. mann is
prohibited for life from possessing any firearm, ammunition, restricted weapon,
or explosive substance.
•
dna will be ordered (secondary designated offence)
•
a forfeiture order is granted in respect of the firearm,
ammunition, and prohibited device.
accordingly,
mr. mann is sentenced to a
total of three years and six months imprisonment
,
less 574 days of enhanced pre-sentence credit, resulting in a remaining
custodial term of one year, eleven months, and eight days.”
