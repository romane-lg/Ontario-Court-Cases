reasons
i.
overview
dylan smith is charged on information 23 p1092 with two offences under
the
highway traffic act
as follows:
1.
on or about the 7
th
day of january in
the year 2023 at the city of london in the county of middlesex did commit the
offence of drive a vehicle carelessly on oxford street east near colborne
street by driving without due care and attention and thereby cause death to
kevin mourant, contrary to section 130, subsection (3) of the
highway traffic
act
.
2.
on or about the 7
th
day of january in
the year 2023 at the city of london in the county of middlesex did commit the
offence of drive a motor vehicle on oxford street east near colborne street
without holding a valid licence issued to him, contrary to
section 32
,
subsection (1)
of the
highway traffic act
.
dylan smith brought an application under
sections 7
and
10
of the
charter
for an order excluding the applicant’s statement pursuant to
section 24(2)
.
a
voir dire
was held to determine the admissibility of the statement
prior to the commencement of the trial.
the application was heard by this court on february 6, 2025. the
materials filed by the applicant include the application form 1, a factum, and
copies of the authorities the applicant is relying on for his legal arguments.
the respondent, crown attorney on behalf of his majesty the king, filed a
record consisting of the response form 2, a factum, and copies of the
authorities the respondent is relying on for their legal arguments. london
police service constable keegan dew testified at the hearing. no other oral
evidence was presented to the court.
the issue in the application is if dylan smith was denied his right to
counsel pursuant to
section 10
of the
charter
.
ii.
facts
the facts are not in dispute regarding this application. on january 7,
2023 london police service constable keegan dew received a message from
dispatch to attend the scene of an accident. he arrived at the scene in a
police cruiser with lights and sirens operating and he was in full police
uniform. constable dew observed multiple individuals standing in close
proximity to a person on the ground who appeared to have been struck by a motor
vehicle. he made inquiries about who was driving the motor vehicle and
identified dylan smith as the driver.
dylan smith was visibly upset and constable dew took steps to get him
away from the individual who was struck by the vehicle. constable dew’s oral
evidence at the hearing was that he said something similar to “let’s go for a
walk, let’s go over here”. dylan smith walked away and constable dew followed
him. dylan smith was then approached by paramedics at which point constable dew
moved about 10 feet away to give dylan smith privacy while he received medical
attention from the paramedics.
when dylan smith was done with the paramedics, constable dew
walked back towards him. they were standing on someone’s front lawn. it was
january, dark outside and in close proximity to the individual who was struck
by the vehicle. constable dew asked dylan smith to go have a seat in his
cruiser, which was located approximately 50 feet away, just west of the
intersection.
dylan smith was not touched, handcuffed or otherwise physically
restrained while they walked to the cruiser. constable dew opened the back door
to the cruiser, dylan smith got in and constable dew closed the door. constable
dew then sat in the front, driver’s seat of the cruiser. there was plexiglass
dividing the backseat from the front seat and the rear doors and windows of the
cruiser cannot be opened from the inside.
constable dew cannot recall his conversation with dylan smith, but he
does recall taking it slow with him and being calm and empathetic. his
motivation for having them go to the cruiser was that it was a more appropriate
place to be in the circumstances.
constable
dew also recalls telling dylan smith that he would be needing a statement from
him. before taking the statement he read a caution from his duty book. he
cautioned dylan smith that he may be charged with the
criminal code
offence of
dangerous driving, that he did not have to say anything and that anything dylan
smith said may be given in evidence. constable dew did not inform dylan smith
of his right to counsel prior to taking dylan smith’s statement.
dylan
smith provided a statement. the process of obtaining the statement took
approximately 45 minutes. he was never informed he could ask to leave and he
did not ask to leave the vehicle at any time.
after
constable dew collected the statement, he left dylan smith in the back of the
cruiser for approximately 5 minutes while he spoke to his staff sergeant about
the status of dylan smith’s cell phone. he was informed dylan smith could not
get his cell phone returned to him. the motor vehicle was seized as part of the
investigation. constable dew requested dylan smith’s keys, which were also
seized as part of the investigation. constable dew then drove dylan smith home.
constable dew contacted victim services for dylan smith upon his return home.
constable
dew did not charge dylan smith with any offences. dylan smith was charged 12
days later on january 19, 2023 with the 2 counts under the
highway traffic
act
as described above.
iii.
analysis
section
10(b)
of the
charter
reads:
10. everyone has the right on arrest or detention
(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and
to be informed of that right;
the
issue in this application is whether dylan smith’s statement was obtained in a
manner that breached his rights under the
charter
. the supreme court of
canada has addressed this issue in
r. v. grant
and
r. v. suberu
.
the supreme court’s approach to the definition of “detention” is purposive. it
is summarized in
suberu
as follows:
in
grant
, we adopted a purposive approach to the
definition of "detention" and held that a "detention" for
the purposes of the
charter
refers to a suspension of an individual's
liberty interest by virtue of a significant physical or psychological restraint
at the hands of the state. the recognition that detention can manifest in both
physical and psychological form is consistent with our acceptance that police
actions short of holding an individual behind bars or in handcuffs can be
coercive enough to engage the rights protected by
ss. 9
and
10
of the
charter
.
while a detention is clearly indicated by the existence of
physical restraint or a legal obligation to comply with a police demand, a
detention can also be grounded when police conduct would cause a reasonable
person to conclude that he or she no longer had the freedom to choose whether
or not to cooperate with the police. as discussed more fully in
grant
,
this is an objective determination, made in light of the circumstances of an
encounter as a whole.
in
the case before this court constable dew arrived at the scene of an accident
and asked a group of bystanders who was driving the vehicle. the preliminary
questioning at the scene by constable dew was a legitimate exercise of police
powers. at this stage, a reasonable person would not have concluded they were
being deprived of their right to choose how to act. it is clear there was no
detention at the time constable dew obtained information that mr. smith was the
driver. this is not at issue in this appeal and is consistent with the findings
in
r. v. grant
and a number of ontario court of appeal decisions the respondent submitted as
authorities in their response to this application.
the
issue in this application is whether dylan smith was detained when he gave his
statement while he was seated in the police cruiser. mr. smith argues that the
police breached his
charter
rights by failing to advise him of his right
to speak to a lawyer contrary to
section 10
. the crown argues that dylan smith
was not arrested or detained at the time he provided his statement and there
was no breach because his
charter
rights under
section 10
were not
triggered at that time.
all
parties agree that mr. smith was entitled to be advised of the right to counsel
if he was detained when he gave his statement. they also agree that if the
court decides he was detained, the statement should be excluded pursuant to
section 24(2)
of the
charter
.
a
summary of the factors relevant to the issue of detention are set out in
grant
and
suberu
as follows:
1.
detention under
ss.9
and
10
of the
charter
refers to a suspension of the individual’s liberty interest by a
significant physical or psychological restraint. psychological detention is
established either where the individual has a legal obligation to comply with
the restrictive request or demand, or a reasonable person would conclude by
reason of the state conduct that he or she had no choice but to comply.
2.
in cases where there is no
physical restraint or legal obligation, it may not be clear whether a person
has been detained. to determine whether the reasonable person in the
individual’s circumstances would conclude that he or she had been deprived by
the state of the liberty of choice, the court may consider, inter alia, the
following factors:
a.
the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they
would reasonably be perceived by the individual: whether the police were
providing general assistance; maintaining general order; making general
inquiries regarding a particular occurrence; or singling out the individual for
focused investigation.
b.
the nature of the police conduct, including the
language used; the use of physical contact; the place where the interaction
occurred; the presence of others; and the duration of the encounter.
c.
the particular characteristics or
circumstances of the individual where relevant, including age; physical
stature; minority status; level of sophistication.
the
respondent submitted the supreme court of canada case of
r. v. therens
.
that case addresses a temporary restraint that falls short of formal arrest in
the context of
s.234
and
236
of the
criminal code of canada
for the
purpose of carrying out procedures authorized by law. although that case
involves potential consequence of criminal charges for failing to comply with
the demand made by the office, justice le dain (dissenting, but the majority
agreed with him regarding his analysis on detention) goes further than the fact
scenario before them to address the viewpoint of an average citizen in
situations similar to the one before this court where there is no risk of
prosecution for refusing to give a statement:
in my opinion, it is not realistic, as a general rule, to
regard compliance with a demand or direction by a police officer as truly
voluntary, in the sense that the citizen feels that he or she has the choice to
obey or not, even where there is in fact a lack of statutory or common law
authority for the demand or direction and therefore an absence of criminal
liability for failure to comply with it. most citizens are not aware of the
precise legal limits of police authority. rather than risk the application of
physical force or prosecution for willful obstruction, the reasonable person is
likely to err on the side of caution, assume lawful authority and comply with
the demand. the element of psychological compulsion, in the form of a
reasonable perception of suspension of freedom of choice, is enough to make the
restraint of liberty involuntary. detention may be effected without the
application or threat of application of physical restraint if the person
concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of liberty reasonably
believes that the choice to do so does not exist.
both
grant
and
suberu
make it clear that rights subsidiary to detention, including the right to
remain silent and the right to counsel, are triggered at the point when the
individual is detained.
in
the judgment delivered by chief justice mclachlin and justice charron in
grant
they explain that the above referenced
therens
case held “that detention
for
charter
purposes occurs when a state agent, by way of physical or
psychological restraint, takes away an individual’s choice simply to walk
away.”
the
fundamental right to choose is discussed in
grant
as follows:
the general principle that determines detention for
charter
purposes was set out in
therens
: [page 378] a person is detained
where he or she "submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of liberty and
reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does not exist" (
per
le dain j., at p. 644). this principle is consistent with the notion of
choice that underlies our conception of liberty and, as such, shapes our
interpretation of
ss. 9
and
10
of the
charter
. when detention removes
the "choice to do otherwise" but comply with a police direction, s.
10(
b
) serves an indispensable purpose. it protects, among other
interests, the detainee's ability to choose whether to cooperate with the
investigation by giving a statement. the ambit of detention for constitutional
purposes is informed by the need to safeguard this choice without impairing
effective law enforcement. this explains why the extremes of formally asserted
control on the one hand and a passing encounter on the other have been
rejected; the former restricts detention in a way that denies the accused
rights he or she needs and should have, while the latter would confer rights
where they are neither necessary or appropriate.
the language of ss. 9 and 10 is consistent with this
purpose-based approach to detention. the pairing of "detained" and
"imprisoned" in s. 9 provides textual guidance for determining where
the constitutional line between justifiable and unjustifiable interference
should be drawn. "imprisonment" connotes total or near-total loss of
liberty. the juxtaposition of "imprisoned" with "detained"
suggests that a "detention" requires significant deprivation of
liberty. similarly, the words "arrest or detention" in s. 10 suggest
that a "detention" exists when the deprivation of liberty may have
legal consequences. this linguistic context requires exclusion of police stops
where the subject's rights are not seriously in issue.
an
individual is detained when their “choice to do otherwise” but comply with
police direction is removed. safeguarding that choice without impairing
effective law enforcement is the constitutional purpose and the reason section
10 extends beyond formal arrests to other circumstances where the deprivation
of liberty may have legal consequences.
there
are two forms of psychological detention described in
grant
:
1.
where the subject is legally required to comply
with a direction or demand; and
2.
where there is no legal obligation to comply with
a restrictive or coercive demand, but a reasonable person in the subject’s
position would feel so obligated.
the
first form of psychological does not apply to dylan smith’s situation. pursuant
to section 199 of the
highway traffic act
dylan smith was legally
required to report the accident to police and provide the officer the
information concerning the accident as may be required by the officer.
he was not under any legal requirement to provide a statement.
the
second form of psychological detention is the applicable form under review for
this application. it is acknowledged in
grant
that this form of psychological
detention is difficult to define.
this case is no exception to that finding.
to
determine if a reasonable person in dylan smith’s position would feel obligated
to give constable dew a statement, this court must consider several factors. as
held in
grant
and
suberu
the determination is an objective one,
taking into consideration all the circumstances of the particular legal and
factual situation and analyzing how a reasonable person in the situation would
perceive the conduct of police constable dew.
the
test is set out in
grant
as follows:
the objective nature of this inquiry recognizes that the
police must be able to know when a detention occurs, in order to allow them to
fulfill their attendant obligations under the
charter
and afford the
individual its added protections. however, the subjective intentions of the
police are not determinative. (questions such as police "good faith"
may become relevant when the test for exclusion of evidence under
s. 24(2)
is
applied, in cases where a
charter
breach is found.) while the test is
objective, the individual's particular circumstances and perceptions at the
time may be relevant in assessing the reasonableness of any perceived power
imbalance between the individual and the police, and thus the reasonableness of
any perception that he or she had no choice but to comply with the police
directive. to answer the question whether there is a detention involves a
realistic appraisal of the entire interaction as it developed, not a minute parsing
of words and movements. in those situations where the police may be uncertain
whether their conduct is having a coercive effect on the individual, it is open
to them to inform the subject in unambiguous terms that he or she is under no
obligation to answer questions and is free to go. it is for the trial judge,
applying the proper legal principles to the particular facts of the case, to
determine whether the line has been crossed between police conduct that
respects liberty and the individual's right to choose, and conduct that does
not.
suberu
confirms that the applicant has the onus to show that in the circumstances they
were effectively deprived of their liberty of choice.
dylan smith did not testify or provide affidavit evidence at the application to
provide the court with information regarding his perspective about what
occurred on january 7, 2023. the test is an objective one, so his decision not
to testify is in no way fatal to his application.
the
respondent submitted several cases with different situations illustrating when
the
section 10
charter
rights line is and is not crossed.
in
grant
the individual’s liberty to choose to remain or leave was taken away
by the conduct of police officers who blocked his path.
in
suberu
, which is described by the supreme court of canada as the
companion case to
grant
, the individual was not detained during a brief
exchange of some initial investigative questions prior to his arrest. the line
between general questioning and focused interrogation is addressed and it was
held the initial part of the encounter was the police officer orienting himself
to the situation. he was trying to sort out if mr. suberu was involved in a
criminal act such that he would need to detain or arrest him. the police
officer was engaged in a general inquiry and had not yet zeroed in on mr.
suberu.
factors considered in
suberu
include: the officer making no move to
obstruct mr. suberu’s movement, the very brief duration of the encounter; and
the purpose of the questioning to find out whether to proceed further.
in
the ontario court of appeal cases
r. v. esposito
and
r. v. bazinet
(pre-date
grant
and
suberu
) police attended at suspects’
residences and questioned them there. they were possible suspects at the time
and they provided some incriminating evidence in response to questions put to
them by the police. the ontario court of appeal held in both cases that they
were not detained during questioning.
similarly,
in
r. v. nicholas
,
the ontario court of appeal held there was no deprivation of liberty where
police attended at the residence and informed the person about offences they
were investigating. there was no detention when he voluntarily provided a dna
sample in those circumstances.
in
r. v. hicks
the individual was a suspect and voluntarily attended the police station with
his lawyer. a single question was asked while he was in an interview room to
determine if he was the driver of the motor vehicle. he was arrested as soon as
the police determined he was the driver. he was not detained when the question
was asked.
r.
v. guenter
is similar to dylan smith’s situation in that mr. guenter was taken to a police
cruiser. unlike dylan smith’s situation, the purpose of moving mr. guenter to
the cruiser was for the production of documentation, not for any kind of
statement. only four minutes had elapsed from the time officers arrived on
scene to when mr. guenter was arrested. mr. guenter was not placed in the back
of the cruiser until he was arrested, at which time he was read his rights to
counsel and caution. the encounter between mr. guenter and the police took
place during the initial stages of an accident investigation preliminary to any
focus on possible charges.
another
case involving a police cruiser is
r. v. rowson
.
the individual was walked over to a police vehicle and placed in the back seat.
he was placed there for his own safety and comfort. he was not necessarily
detained at that time, but detention occurred while he was still seated in the
cruiser once the police began to suspect a criminal offence had been committed
and once they told him he was no longer free to use his cell phone.
the
respondent submitted several cases that speak to the status of detention prior
to police demands or arrest. there is a common finding in those cases that
there is no detention prior to police determining they have reasonable grounds
to make a demand or an arrest. factors considered in those cases include:
1.
the officer’s
subjective intent is accompanied by actual conduct;
2.
exigent circumstances
or rapid events in a fluid and dynamic situation
;
3.
the officer
making no move to obstruct movement;
4.
the purpose for
the officer’s questions (preliminary questioning to understand what had
transpired does not amount to detention);
5.
the officer’s
conduct (intimidating or inducing overtones, hostile or coercive);
6.
inhumane or
oppressive conditions;
an
additional factor raised by the applicant is the presence of any practical
barriers to the officer(s) fulfilling the
charter
requirements.
the applicant submits there were no barriers and constable dew should have held
off on obtaining the statement from dylan smith until he had an opportunity to
speak to counsel or waive his right to do so. he relies on the case of
r. v.
tutu
for the finding that failure to inform and provide rights to counsel
is compounded where information is elicited in furtherance of an investigation
in those circumstances.
was the appellant detained prior to providing his
statement?
this
is not a case where the facts easily fall to one end of the spectrum or the
other that would make the status of detention apparent. as such, the analysis
must consider the entire interaction as it developed and make a determination
about the reasonableness of any perceived power imbalance between dylan smith
and constable dew and the perception that dylan smith had no choice but to
comply with the police directive to provide a statement.
the
crown submits that the detention of dylan smith did not crystalize when he gave
constable dew his statement on january 7, 2023. there are several factors that
weigh in favour of this position. constable dew was respectful and
compassionate the entire time. his conduct was not intimidating, hostile or
coercive. he did not use tactics to induce dylan smith to provide a statement.
during his testimony, constable dew informed the court that he considered the
cruiser a more appropriate place to sit and wait. he was concerned about dylan
smith’s welfare and moved him there to keep him warm and protected from the
chaos of the horrific accident scene. his recollection of events is that he
asked and never ordered dylan smith to do things that evening. he explained
that if dylan smith had refused to do anything he asked him to do, that would
be fine. dylan smith never asked to leave.
constable
dew does not recall touching dylan smith. we was never handcuffed and was never
placed under arrest. constable dew does not recall exactly what he said to
dylan smith when they approached the cruiser, but told the court he would
typically say something like, “you are not under arrest or anything, just have
a seat”. constable dew did not charge him with any offences.
constable
dew recalled telling dylan smith that he would be needing a statement from him.
he cautioned him prior to taking the statement by informing him that he may be
charged with an offence, that he did not have to say anything and that anything
he did say could be used as evidence. dylan smith acknowledged his
understanding of the caution provided to him. the respondent submits that dylan
smith voluntarily provided his statement knowing he did not have to say
anything.
dylan
smith submits that he was detained at the time he gave his statement to
constable dew on january 7, 2023. dylan smith was cooperative and did
everything constable dew asked of him that evening. constable dew stayed in
close proximity to dylan smith from the moment he learned that dylan smith was
the driver until he dropped him off at home. that included moving away from the
individual who was struck, giving minimal space for privacy while dylan smith
was obtaining medical attention from paramedics, walking to the police cruiser
and while seated in the cruiser.
while
dylan smith was seated in the back of the police cruiser he had no independent
means of leaving that space. there is no evidence he was informed that he could
leave or that he could ask to leave. constable dew was seated in the front seat
and they were separated by a plexiglass barrier. while dylan smith was seated
in the back of the cruiser constable dew gathered both physical (car keys) and
verbal (statement) evidence. the police cruiser was not just a place to sit and
wait as constable dew indicated in his evidence. it was a place where constable
dew was obtaining evidence for his investigation.
constable
dew had enough information prior to obtaining the statement to caution dylan
smith that he may be charged with the
criminal code of canada
offence of
dangerous driving. he told dylan smith conflicting information about the
statement. he said he would be needing a statement from him and he also
cautioned him that he did not have to say anything.
the
crown wants to use dylan smith’s statement at the trial. it is reasonable to
assume his statement contains at least some incriminating evidence.
to
determine if a reasonable person in dylan smith’s circumstances would conclude
they were detained, this court must consider the factors set out in
grant
and
suberu
as follows:
1.
the
circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be
perceived by the individual: whether the police were providing general
assistance; maintaining general order; making general inquiries regarding a
particular occurrence; or singling out the individual for focused
investigation.
this
court recognizes the findings in
grant
regarding the important role of
police in gathering information and the necessity of interference with an
individual’s freedom of movement to carry out that role (per mclachlin c.j. and
charron j. in
grant
at paragraphs
36 to 39
). this is not a situation
where it was unbeknownst to constable dew that dylan smith was implicated in
the occurrence. he knew at the time that there had been a serious accident,
that the individual was or would soon be deceased and that mr. smith was the
driver. it is fair to say that dylan smith was singled out at that point for a
focused investigation.
2.
the nature of
the police conduct, including the language used; the use of physical contact;
the place where the interaction occurred; the presence of others; and the
duration of the encounter.
constable
dew’s intention may not have been to physically and/or psychologically restrain
dylan smith or to implement tactics that were coercive enough to effectively
remove dylan smith’s choice to walk away from the situation, but his intentions
are not the legal test. the test is whether a reasonable person in mr. smith’s
position would conclude they had been deprived of the liberty of choice. the
interaction commenced when constable dew discovered dylan smith was the driver.
he escorted him away from the scene, to the paramedics and then to his cruiser.
the statement was taken while dylan smith was isolated from others in the back
seat of a police cruiser with no independent ability to walk away or access to
any form of electronic communication device. constable dew typically informs
people in that situation that they are not under arrest, but he does not recall
what he said to dylan smith that evening. dylan smith was not informed that he
had the choice to walk away. he was cautioned about charges he may face and was
aware of his right not to say anything as well as the potential consequences
about how anything he does say may be used as evidence.
the
duration of obtaining the statement took approximately 45 minutes. mr. smith
was left alone in the backseat of the cruiser for approximately 5 minutes after
that while constable dew obtained information about the status of his cell
phone from his sergeant. constable dew offered to drive him home and dylan
smith remained in the rear seat of the cruiser for that portion of the evening
as well. it was not until after he provided his statement that dylan smith
learned he was not being charged with any offences.
3.
the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where
relevant, including age; physical stature; minority status; level of
sophistication.
dylan
smith was 21 years old at the time. no evidence was presented to the court
about his mental capacity or any previous experiences he has had with the
police. he was upset about the accident and it is reasonable to conclude he was
in a vulnerable emotional state at the time he provided his statement to
constable dew.
the
situational examples from the cases noted above as well as the additional
factors examined by those courts are considered as follows:
1.
constable dew’s
subjective intent was to move to a more comfortable environment to obtain a
statement from dylan smith. although his conduct was not aggressive in any way,
a reasonable person would perceive the situation differently than constable
dew. there was a power imbalance exacerbated by dylan smith’s young age and
vulnerable emotional state. after being placed in the backseat of a cruiser,
told the officer needed a statement from him and cautioned about a charge he
may face, it is reasonable he felt he had no choice but to remain and provide
his statement.
2.
there were
exigent circumstances and a very dynamic situation unfolding but, unlike other
officers in some of the other authorities considered in this application,
constable dew’s focus was only on dylan smith. there were no practical barriers
to him fulfilling the informational requirements of s.10(b). he had the time
and focus to provide dylan smith with a caution about the criminal code
offence, a warning he did not have to say anything and how information he did
convey may be used.
3.
constable dew
did obstruct the movement of dylan smith when he placed him in the back of the
cruiser with no independent means of departure.
4.
constable dew
was past the point of preliminary questioning when he took the statement from
dylan smith. he was not orienting himself to the situation or figuring out the
nature of dylan smith’s involvement. he knew what happened and that dylan smith
was the driver. by cautioning him before he took the statement, he demonstrated
an understanding that dylan smith may provide incriminating evidence at that
point. constable dew was no longer entitled simply to expect cooperation from
dylan smith once there was a risk that he felt compelled to incriminate
himself. a reasonable person would feel their choice to walk away was removed
while confined in the rear seat of a police cruiser and being told by the
officer that he needed a statement from them.
5.
constable dew’s
conduct was not intimidating, inducing, hostile or coercive. dylan smith was
not placed in inhumane or oppressive conditions. despite these factors, for all
the reasons noted above, the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to
believe they had to remain and provide a statement.
this
is not a situation where dylan smith felt compelled to cooperate with police
out of a sense of moral or civic duty. by the time dylan smith provided his
statement to constable dew he was no longer a bystander whose freedom of
movement was interfered with as a result of police taking control of the
situation. constable dew had specific grounds to connect dylan smith to the
commission of a crime. a reasonable person in dylan smith’s circumstances would
conclude their choice to walk away was removed. whether or not the intention of
constable dew was to take control over dylan smith and to elicit incriminating
information, the physical and psychological situation crossed that line.
conclusion
dylan
smith was detained when he provided his statement to constable dew while seated
in the back of the police cruiser on january 7, 2023. at that point mr. smith’s
liberty was constrained and he was in need of the
charter
protection
associated with
section 10(b)
, to retain and instruct counsel without delay and
to be informed of that right. he was denied that right.
exclusion of the evidence
section
24(2)
of the
charter
reads:
where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court
concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any
rights or freedoms guaranteed by this
charter
, the evidence shall be
excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the
admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.
at
the start of these proceedings the parties agreed that if this court held that
dylan smith was detained without his right to counsel, the statement should be
excluded pursuant to
section 24(2)
of the
charter
. having regard to all
the circumstances and the position of the parties on this point, i find that
the admission of dylan smith’s statement would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.
