overview
of assessment application
the crown has applied for mr.
williams to undergo a psychiatric assessment pursuant to
s. 752.1
of the
criminal
code
. this section reads:
752.1 (1)
on application
by the prosecutor, if the court is of the opinion that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that an offender who is convicted of a serious personal
injury offence or an offence referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a) might be
found to be a dangerous offender under section 753 or a long-term offender
under section 753.1, the court shall, by order in writing, before sentence is
imposed, remand the offender, for a period not exceeding 60 days, to the
custody of a person designated by the court who can perform an assessment or
have an assessment performed by experts for use as evidence in an application
under section 753 or 753.1.
the applicable sections
under which the crown says mr.
williams may be found a dangerous offender (do) or long-term offender (lto)
are:
753
(1)
on
application made under this part after an assessment report is filed under
subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to be a dangerous
offender if it is satisfied
(a)
that the offence for which the offender has been
convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of
the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a
threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well- being of other persons
on the basis of evidence establishing
(i)
a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of
which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing
a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or
injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other
persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour,
(ii)
a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the
offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a
part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender
respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or
her behaviour…
753.1
(1)
the court may, on application made under this part
following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find an
offender to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that
(a)
it would be appropriate to
impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for
which the offender has been convicted;
(b)
there is a substantial risk
that the offender will reoffend; and
(c)
there is a reasonable
possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.
the predicate offence is one count
of assault with a weapon. mr. williams pled to this offence on september 5,
2024. the crown proceeded by indictment, making the maximum sentence not more
than ten years custody.
it is distinctly
possible that mr. williams struggles cognitively. ms. rochman was appointed to
assist the court with issues that mr. williams, as an in-custody self-
represented litigant, could not meaningfully advance himself. she has also
taken great care to ensure mr. williams understands this process.
mr. williams had no substantive
legal submissions to the crown’s assessment application. as
amicus curiae,
ms.
rochman’s submissions invited consideration of the following:
(i)
what parts of this evidentiary
record can the court safely rely upon?
(ii)
is there a legitimate statutory
basis upon which a successful do/lto application could rest, including:
(a)
is there a relevant pattern within
the meaning of subsections (i) or (ii)? [ref: do preconditions, s.
753(1)(i)(ii)]
(b)
should i consider, at this stage,
whether a sentence of two years or more would be appropriate for the predicate
offence? [ref: lto preconditions, s. 753.1(1)(a)]
(c)
if so, and if a two-year sentence
is inappropriate for the predicate offence, is it a do prerequisite that mr.
williams receive a sentence of two years or more for the predicate offence?
these reasons explain why the
crown’s application for psychiatric assessment has succeeded.
the
evidentiary record
the crown relied upon three forms
of evidence in this application: police synopses, a cpic print-out of
convictions, and court transcripts. all three were acknowledged to be
admissible, but
amicus
invited caution in assessing police synopses.
two main points underlay this
submission. first, some synopses were challenging to match up with cpic
entries, leading to the question of whether some could be linked to findings of
guilt. second, synopses alone are not necessarily credible, reliable proof of
the factual details of a criminal offence. as the court of appeal said
in
r.
v. williams
2018 onca 437
at para.
55
:
due to the evidentiary frailties
inherent in the nature of a police synopsis, caution is required when the
sentencing judge is considering whether the contents of those records can,
along with the rest of the record, provide the basis for a finding that the
statutory elements of dangerousness have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
the incidents set out in the synopses must be considered in light of all of the
evidence led at the hearing. certain parts of a synopsis may find support and
confirmation, either directly or by reasonable inference, in other parts of the
record. if so, it is open to the sentencing judge to rely on those incidents as
evidence in support of a finding that the statutory elements of dangerousness,
such as the requisite pattern of behaviour, are made out.
appendix a to this decision sets
out where and how police synopses were found to match to cpic entries in this
case. this is not to say that the
facts
in those synopses were accepted,
wholesale, as accurate. they were not. some were weakly corroborated and could
bear little weight. appendix a to this judgment summarizes my conclusions about
each synopsis.
the court transcripts and cpic
record were both capable of receiving significant weight. the transcripts were
certified copies. mr. williams, after reviewing the cpic record with
amicus,
acknowledged its accuracy.
at age 38, mr. williams has a
depressingly consistent criminal record. as a youth, he incurred eight findings
of guilt, including violent entries in 2001 and 2003. as an adult, he has been
convicted of multiple offences almost every year
for 18 years. mr. williams has
been found guilty, as an adult, of sixty-seven criminal offences in the past 20
years.
mr. williams asked me to remember
that he has been homeless and struggling to survive his entire adult life. many
of the sentencing transcripts confirmed this. they showed mr. williams becoming
disruptive after being refused money or insulted while panhandling, or being
moved along from a warm place he was illegally sleeping in, or being removed
from public places for trespassing.
a palpable connection exists
between mr. williams’ unhoused, marginalized status and the number and nature
of his criminal convictions. additionally, many of his convictions are minor,
non-violent offences. but there are also multiple entries for violent,
assaultive behaviour:
•
two adult convictions for assault
with a weapon (2024 and 2008);
•
one adult conviction for assault
cause bodily harm to peace officer (2020);
•
one adult conviction for assault
cause bodily harm (2008);
•
fourteen adult convictions for
common assault (various dates in 2023, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2015, 2014,
2011, 2009, 2008, 2007)
•
five convictions for uttering
threats.
but mr. williams
has never received a penitentiary sentence. indeed, he has never been sentenced
to more than 12 months in custody. his 2023 set of convictions resulted in a
global total of 12 months custody being imposed, as did a prior set of
convictions from 2020
.
mr. williams has been placed on
probation many times. he has been convicted of breaching probation orders on
sixteen different occasions. an early transcript referred to a diagnosis of
conduct disorder. others referred to a diagnosis of schizophrenia and past
community treatment orders.
some transcripts suggested
non-compliance with treatment was connected to his offending. recently
, rose j. prophetically said:
his reluctance to get help for
psychological issues leads me to find that mr. williams is at a high risk to
re-offend and violently re-offend….if mr. williams does not get help and stop
re-offending violently, he may well appear before the court in the future
facing a long term or dangerous offender application. there is every reason to
believe mr. williams will attack a stranger violently at some time after he is
released from custody.
in reviewing cpic in conjunction
with the transcripts, it was clear that the cycle of mr. williams’ re-offending
could be concerningly short. for example, three convictions from 2023 reflected
violent assaults committed on december 1 2022, december 7 2022 (10 days later),
and january 22 2023 (46 days later).
on june 6, 2023, he was sentenced
to twelve months less presentence custody for those assaults. the time mr.
williams had left to serve, after sentence was imposed, was five months.
five months later, on november 1,
2023, he committed the predicate offence of assault with a weapon. i do not
know the precise date he was released from custody. but
clearly, he was not in the community long before
re-offending violently and, as will be explained, in a very similar way.
analysis:
serious personal injury offence
mr. williams admitted that in the
early evening of november 1, 2023, he assaulted a 22-year-old female university
student. she was a stranger to him and was walking alone. mr. williams made eye
contact with her, spoke some “gibberish”, and then began following her.
the victim got nervous. she took
off her headphones and picked up her walking pace. mr. williams reacted by
running toward her. he threw a rock at her head. it connected. she fell to the
ground and mr. williams left the scene. the victim was left with a concussion,
a laceration requiring stitches, and significant emotional trauma.
indisputably, this conviction for
assault with a weapon met the “serious personal injury” threshold: see the
definition in s. 752(a).
analysis:
court might make do / lto finding
next, the crown had to establish
reasonable grounds to believe mr. williams might be found to be a dangerous
offender or a long-term offender.
the threshold for this latter precondition is low. as
per
r. v. whitmore,
2011 onsc 6976
at para.
14
:
this last step in the analysis
has been described as whether the court has a reasonable suspicion on the
circumstances of this case that the accused might be found to be a
"dangerous offender" or a "long term offender". the
threshold is very low, in fact below the standard of balance of probabilities.
all that is required is the possibility the crown may establish either status
on the ultimate application using such an assessment. see
r. v. vincent,
o.j. no. 5623 (s.c.j.) at para. 3
;
r. v. torres,
o.j. no. 1402
(s.c.j.) at para. 22 and 23
;
r. v. mcarthur,
o.j. no. 5146
(s.c.j.) at para. 20
and
r. v. vanderwhal
,
2010 onsc 265 (canlii)
, o.j. no. 246 at para.
27
.
similarly, quigley, j. said
in
r.
v. states,
2015 onsc 3265
at paras.
45-46
, 51:
….the threshold standard for
ordering an assessment under s. 752.1 has always been low. in
r. v. mcarthur
,
decided in the context of the pre-1997 legislative framework but equally
applicable today, laforme j., as he then was, confirmed that
s. 752.1
is merely
a procedural step and a summary proceeding. he confirmed that the applicable
standard is "a possibility" that the offender might be found to be a
dangerous offender. the question is not a complex one. it is simply whether the
offender should be remanded for observation by a psychiatric expert for the
purpose of gathering evidence that would or may later assist in the
determination of whether he is in fact a dangerous or long-term offender.
this view was further confirmed
and followed by this court after the 2008 amendments. in r. v. stratton,
bellefontaine j. found that a
s. 752.1
application for assessment is intended
to be a lesser summary proceeding. a plain reading of the provision, and
particularly the use of the word "might," confirmed in his view that
the threshold standard is lower than the criminal or even civil standards of
proof. in r. v. fulton, 14 the saskatchewan court of appeal found, at para. 21,
that "might speaks to possibilities" and that, in determining whether
to make an order for assessment, the court must ask whether the prospect of the
offender being found to be a dangerous or long-term offender is merely
"within the realm of possibility or beyond it."
***
it seems clear that on any fair
reading of the current jurisprudence, the applicable standard is indeed low,
plainly some distance below the balance of probabilities and a great distance
removed from the criminal standard of proof that applies on the dangerous
offender charact­erization itself.
r. v. mcarthur,
o.j. no. 5146 (gen. div.)
at para. 20
put the
question to be decided as “based on the circumstances and evidence, is it a
logical conclusion that there is a possibility the offender might be found to
be a dangerous offender? …. is the court satisfied, after weighing and
balancing all the relevant considerations, including the evidence, that the
offender should be remanded for observation?”
amicus
observed that the threshold may be low, but it still
exists and for good reason. potentially, a s. 752.1 assessment is the first
step towards state control over an individual’s liberty for the rest of their
life: see
r. v. naess,
o.j. no. 936 (s.c.j.)
at para. 77
;
r.
v. p.h.
o.j. no. 5698 (s.c.j.)
at para. 32
.
this assessment application must not be approached lightly, no matter where the
threshold of proof falls.
the crown referenced two possible
paths to a dangerous offender finding in this case. i agree with mr. smith that
the crown need not particularize, at this stage, which path the crown intends
to pursue.
the two paths have commonalities. both require
establishing a specific behavioural pattern:
(i)
a
pattern
of
repetitive
behaviour
by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted
forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a
likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe
psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to
restrain his or her behaviour,
(ii)
a
pattern
of
persistent
aggressive
behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been
convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the
part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to
other persons of his or her behaviour…
[

]
helpful definitions of “pattern”,
“repetitive”, and “persistent” were included at
r. v. naess, supra
at
para. 61:
a pattern is a repeated and
connected design or order of things as opposed to a differentiated or random
arrangement. repetitive or persistent connotes "constantly repeating"
(
r. v. yanoshewski
(1996),
1996 canlii 4916 (sk ca)
, 104 c.c.c. (3d) 512 (sask. c.a.)) or
"renewal or recurrence of an action or event"; "continuous;
constantly repeated"; "existing continuously in time; enduring":
the shorter oxford english dictionary
,
supra
at 1560, 1798.
i agree with both counsel that
“pattern”, in this context, must be more than generically observing the
repetition of violent behaviour. as per
r. v. wong,
2016 onsc 6362
at
para.
199
, the pattern of
…repetitive behaviour that
includes the predicate offence has to contain enough of the same elements of
unrestrained dangerous conduct to be able to predict that the offender will
likely offend in the same way in the future" (
r. v. hogg,
2011 onca 840 (canlii)
,
o.j. no. 5963 (ont. c.a.) at para.
40
).
r. v. tynes,
2022 onca 866
provided
more guidance on this point. at
para. 67, tulloch j.a. [
as he then was
] explained the first subsection’s
pattern requirement:
justice watt of this court held
in
r. v. gibson
,
2021 onca 530
, 157 o.r. (3d) 597, that the pattern
requirement in s. 753(1)(a)(i) is not based exclusively on the number of
offences. it is also rooted in the elements of similarity in the offender's
behaviour:
r. v. langevin
(1984),
1984 canlii 1914 (on ca)
, 11 c.c.c. (3d) 336 (ont. c.a.), at pp.
348-49. similarities can be found not only in the types of offences but also in
the degree of violence or aggression threatened or inflicted on the victims:
r.
v. szostak,
2014 onca 15
, 118 o.r. (3d) 401, at para.
33
, leave to appeal
refused, s.c.c.a. no. 300;
r. v. neve
,
1999 abca 206
. where there
are numerous incidents in the pattern - as in this case - fewer similarities
between the incidents are required:
r. v. hogg
,
2011 onca 840
, 287
o.a.c. 82, at paras.
39
;
r. v. jones
,
o.j. no. 1321 (ont. c.a.),
at p. 3
.
tynes
, supra
at paras.
70 and 71
explained that the facts of the
predicate offence need not fit squarely into a pattern under ss. (ii). the
scope appears to be broader, in that the predicate offence must form a part of
persistent, aggressive behaviour:
unlike the "pattern of
repetitive behaviour" in s.753(1)(a)(i), the jurisprudence has not
interpreted this subsection to require similarities between the predicate
offence and past offences. instead, the past behavior must be
"persistent" and coupled with indifference and intractability: see
e.g.,
r. v. wong
,
2016 onsc 6362
, at para.
70
;
r. v. robinson
,
b.c.j. no. 1001 (b.c. s.c.), at para. 122
;
r. v. morin
(1998),
1998 canlii 13883
, 173 sask. r. 101 (sask. q.b.), at para.
85.
based on the appellant's history
of using violence when confronted with problems, particularly in his
interactions with the police, the trial judge was satisfied that there was
evidence of persistent aggressive behavior. i fail to see how this finding was
unreasonable. the appellant had "demonstrated a quality of obstinately
refusing to give up or let go", and all of his violent offences were
triggered by intense emotions, drug use, and confrontation.
similarly, the trial judge
in
r.
v. wong
, supra
at paras.
217 and 218
said:
unlike
the "pattern of repetitive behaviour" in s.753(1)(a)(i), the case law
has not interpreted this subsection as requiring any particular degree of
similarity between the instances of aggressive behaviour. to be persistent, the
past aggressive behaviour need not be continuous, but it must be
"persistent" in the sense of enduring or constantly repeated (
r.
v. robinson
,
b.c.j.
no. 1001
(b.s.s.c.)
at para. 122
;
r.
v. j.y.

,
173 sask
r. 101
(sask. q.b.)
at para.
85
).
aggressive behaviour does not
require an element of physical force. instead, aggressive behaviour "is a
vague term that can run the gamut between 'pushy and overly-confident' to
'extremely violent'" (

application
of law to facts
i can see a logical, reasonable
route between factual findings summarized in appendix a and a conclusion that
mr. williams might be found a dangerous offender. on the current evidentiary
record, this might not be the most
likely
outcome. but at this stage,
that is not the threshold of proof.
the evidence realistically made
out two possible patterns of behaviour fitting the required thresholds.
pattern of repetitive behaviour – section 752(1)(a)(i)
the first pattern showed mr.
william’s past failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of causing
physical injury or severe psychological damage to others by continued failure
to restrain his behaviour.
this pattern was supported by
evidence which included:
i.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked and in public, using a rock thrown at her head, causing physical and
psychological injury. mr. williams followed her before the assault, which
occurred on november 1, 2023 [predicate offence];
ii.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked and in public, by punching her in head, causing physical injury. mr.
williams followed her before the assault, which occurred on january 22, 2023;
iii.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked and in public, by punching her in back, causing physical and
psychological injury. mr. williams approached her unprompted before the
assault, which occurred on december 7, 2022;
iv.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked and in public, by punching her in head, causing physical injury. mr.
williams followed her before the assault, which occurred on december 1, 2022;
v.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked, location unclear but she was leaving a building, by punching her in
the back, causing psychological injury (unknown if physical injury caused) and
which occurred on march 22, 2021;
vi.
the assault of a female stranger,
unprovoked, location unclear but between entrance doors of a building, by
punching her in back, causing physical and psychological injury and which
occurred on april 15, 2020;
vii.
the assault of a
female peace officer, punching her in head during arrest
,
causing physical injury and which occurred in spring or summer of 2020;
viii.
the consistent assaultive
behaviour established over 20 years in his criminal record;
ix.
the short timeline between the
commission of the assaults set out at (i) through (vii);
x.
the pattern of non-compliance with
court orders, meant to restrain behaviour, established over 20 years in his
criminal record.
mr. williams submitted that he did
not deliberately go out seeking female victims. he does not deliberately prey
on women. he described this similarity as incidental. he submitted that the
street life can be hard. his criminal record reflects this fact and his
marginalized existence. but his record should not, he argued, support a
dangerous offender finding.
however, at this stage the crown
need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the requisite pattern exists. the
crown does not have to rule out inferences inconsistent with the presence of
this pattern. only the possibility of a pattern had to be established upon
reasonable grounds. i found, on reasonable grounds, that this possibility had
been proven.
there may be other explanations
for what appears, on a preliminary basis, to be a pattern. mr. williams
assaults people in public because he lives in public spaces. the recent
recurrence of female victims may be, as he says, happenstance. but again, to
accept alternate explanations as dispositive would mean failing to apply the
requisite test.
pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour – section 752(1)(a)(ii)
a second pattern arose from this
evidentiary record. this one fit within the parameters of subsection (ii):
a pattern of persistent
aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she
has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference
on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences
to other persons of his or her behaviour…
on ten occasions between 2013 and
2023, mr. williams physically assaulted and/or threatened a person who refused
him something he wanted (money, to sleep in public, to remain in a location to
panhandle). most of these occurrences involved physical assault. this clearly
showed the potential to fit into a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour.
the facts of each occurrence
demonstrated a substantial degree of indifference about the reasonably
foreseeable consequences to others. the presence of a subsection (ii) pattern
was also suggested by proof of 20 years of committing assaults, threatening people,
and non-compliance with court orders.
while the facts of this pattern of
persistent aggressive behaviour did not fit exactly with the facts of the
predicate offence,
tynes
, supra,
at para.
70
said it need not and binds
this lower court. the predicate offence does, obviously reveal the continuation
of persistent, aggressive behaviour showing mr. williams’ indifference to the
consequences of throwing a rock at someone’s head.
the
lto precondition of two years or more
finally, i am of the view that i should
not consider, at the assessment stage, whether a sentence of two years or more
would realistically be imposed for the predicate offence. this rendered
academic the final question raised, which was whether a sentence of two years
or more must be a dangerous offender prerequisite.
to explain,
amicus
invited
consideration of whether a sentence of two years or more would be likely for
this predicate offence. there is solid evidential support for this argument.
despite the volume of convictions, mr. williams never served a sentence longer
than 12 months. he has never served a sentence in the penitentiary. two years
for one offence would be a significant jump from his prior sentence, which was
12 months for similar misconduct but reflected the commission of three separate
assaults.
indeed it may even be unlikely,
given these points, that this court would impose two years or more for the
predicate offence. but quantum of future sentence should not be determinative
of an assessment application. after all, a sentence of more than two years is
not an impossible outcome either. in my view, this lto prerequisite was met, on
a preliminary basis, by the fact that a sentence of two years or more is a
possible
outcome for this charge.
moreover, the purpose of the legislation
resolved this issue in the crown’s favour. parliamentary intent was to, above
all else, protect the public. it seemed counterintuitive, given that purpose,
to dismiss the crown’s application because i pre-determined sentence on a less
than complete sentencing record.
conclusion
there are reasonable grounds to
believe that mr. williams has been convicted of a serious personal injury
offence. there are reasonable grounds to believe mr. williams
might
be
found a dangerous or long-term offender.
mr. williams should understand
that this does not mean he
will
be found a dangerous or long-term
offender. at this stage, the evidence proved a basis for him to be
psychiatrically assessed for the purpose of assisting with any possible future
s. 753 / 753.1 application.
the application must be granted. a
draft order of remand for assessment may be emailed to me in advance of the
next court date.
given that mr. williams is a
self-represented litigant, i am grateful to ms. rochman for her diligence and
care and to mr. smith for his fairness and objectivity.

mr. williams has

entries from this matter were incorrectly recorded to mr.
williams’ benefit. i preferred the
transcript to the cpic printout on this issue.

n.b.,
the
maximum
penalty
for
assault
with
weapon
is
not
more
than
ten
years,
while
a
serious
personal injury
offence
must
be
punishable
by
a
sentence
of
ten
years
or
more.
this
component
was
met
at
the
ten- year mark.
these
cases
pre-dated
2008
statutory amendments to
the
applicable
legislation, but the
observations at
each paragraph remain an apt reminder.
this
offence
did
not
squarely
fit
within
the
pattern
established
in
the
other
offences
but
had
sufficient points of similarity that i
could not rule it out as part of this pattern either.
some
discussion
of
this
question
was
found
in
r.
v.
naess,
