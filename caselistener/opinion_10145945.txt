CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

    No. 22–915.      Argued November 7, 2023—Decided June 21, 2024
Respondent Zackey Rahimi was indicted under 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8), a
  federal statute that prohibits individuals subject to a domestic violence
  restraining order from possessing a firearm. A prosecution under Sec-
  tion 922(g)(8) may proceed only if the restraining order meets certain
  statutory criteria. In particular, the order must either contain a find-
  ing that the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical
  safety” of his intimate partner or his or his partner’s child,
  §922(g)(8)(C)(i), or “by its terms explicitly prohibit[ ] the use,” at-
  tempted use, or threatened use of “physical force” against those indi-
  viduals, §922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Rahimi concedes here that the restraining
  order against him satisfies the statutory criteria, but argues that on
  its face Section 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment. The District
  Court denied Rahimi’s motion to dismiss the indictment on Second
  Amendment grounds. While Rahimi’s case was on appeal, the Su-
  preme Court decided New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,
  597 U. S. 1 (2022). In light of Bruen, the Fifth Circuit reversed, con-
  cluding that the Government had not shown that Section 922(g)(8) “fits
  within our Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” 61 F.
  4th 443, 460 (CA5 2023).
Held: When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible
 threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be tempo-
 rarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment. Pp. 5–17.
    (a) Since the Founding, the Nation’s firearm laws have included reg-
 ulations to stop individuals who threaten physical harm to others from
 misusing firearms. As applied to the facts here, Section 922(g)(8) fits
 within this tradition.
    The right to keep and bear arms is among the “fundamental rights
 necessary to our system of ordered liberty.” McDonald v. Chicago, 561
2                      UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                                   Syllabus

    U. S. 742, 778. That right, however, “is not unlimited,” District of Co-
    lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626. The reach of the Second Amend-
    ment is not limited only to those arms that were in existence at the
    Founding. Heller, 554 U. S., at 582. Rather, it “extends, prima facie,
    to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were
    not [yet] in existence.” Ibid. By that same logic, the Second Amend-
    ment permits more than just regulations identical to those existing in
    1791.
     Under our precedent, the appropriate analysis involves considering
    whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the principles
    that underpin the Nation’s regulatory tradition. Bruen, 597 U. S., at
    26–31. When firearm regulation is challenged under the Second
    Amendment, the Government must show that the restriction “is con-
    sistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
    Bruen, 597 U. S., at 24. A court must ascertain whether the new law
    is “relevantly similar” to laws that our tradition is understood to per-
    mit, “apply[ing] faithfully the balance struck by the founding genera-
    tion to modern circumstances.” Id., at 29, and n. 7. Why and how the
    regulation burdens the right are central to this inquiry. As Bruen ex-
    plained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its his-
    torical precursors “still may be analogous enough to pass constitu-
    tional muster.” Id., at 30. Pp. 5–8.
       (b) Section 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s challenge. Pp. 8–17.
         (1) Rahimi’s facial challenge to Section 922(g)(8) requires him to
    “establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act
    would be valid.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745. Here,
    Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional as applied to the facts of Rahimi’s
    own case. Rahimi has been found by a court to pose a credible threat
    to the physical safety of others, see §922(g)(8)(C)(i), and the Govern-
    ment offers ample evidence that the Second Amendment permits such
    individuals to be disarmed. P. 8.
         (2) The Court reviewed the history of American gun laws exten-
    sively in Heller and Bruen. At common law people were barred from
    misusing weapons to harm or menace others. Such conduct was often
    addressed through ordinary criminal laws and civil actions, such as
    prohibitions on fighting or private suits against individuals who
    threatened others. By the 1700s and early 1800s, though, two distinct
    legal regimes had developed that specifically addressed firearms vio-
    lence: the surety laws and the “going armed” laws. Surety laws were
    a form of “preventive justice,” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
    Laws of England 251 (10th ed. 1787), which authorized magistrates to
    require individuals suspected of future misbehavior to post a bond. If
    an individual failed to post a bond, he would be jailed. If the individual
    did post a bond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit.

                              Syllabus

Surety laws could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including
spousal abuse, and also targeted the misuse of firearms. These laws
often offered the accused significant procedural protections.
   The “going armed” laws—a particular subset of the ancient common
law prohibition on affrays, or fighting in public—provided a mecha-
nism for punishing those who had menaced others with firearms. Un-
der these laws, individuals were prohibited from “riding or going
armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to] terrify[ ] the good peo-
ple of the land.” 4 Blackstone 149. Those who did so faced forfeiture
of their arms and imprisonment. Prohibitions on going armed were
incorporated into American jurisprudence through the common law,
and some States expressly codified them. Pp. 9–13.
     (3) Together, the surety and going armed laws confirm what com-
mon sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physi-
cal violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.
Section 922(g)(8) is not identical to these founding-era regimes, but it
does not need to be. Like the surety and going armed laws, Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found by a court to threaten the
physical safety of another. This prohibition is “relevantly similar” to
those founding era regimes in both why and how it burdens the Second
Amendment right. Id., at 29. Section 922(g)(8) restricts gun use to
check demonstrated threats of physical violence, just as the surety and
going armed laws do. Unlike the regulation struck down in Bruen,
Section 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use by the public gen-
erally.
   The burden that Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear arms
also fits within the Nation’s regulatory tradition. While the Court does
not suggest that the Second Amendment prohibits the enactment of
laws banning the possession of guns by categories of persons thought
by a legislature to present a special danger of misuse, see Heller, 554
U. S., at 626, Section 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that
the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical safety” of
another, §922(g)(8)(C)(i), which notably matches the similar judicial
determinations required in the surety and going armed laws. Moreo-
ver, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section 922(g)(8) only pro-
hibits firearm possession so long as the defendant “is” subject to a re-
straining order. Finally, the penalty—another relevant aspect of the
burden—also fits within the regulatory tradition. The going armed
laws provided for imprisonment, and if imprisonment was permissible
to respond to the use of guns to threaten the physical safety of others,
then the lesser restriction of temporary disarmament that Section
922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.
   The Court’s decisions in Heller and Bruen do not help Rahimi. While
Section 922(g)(8) bars individuals subject to restraining orders from
4                      UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                                  Syllabus

    possessing guns in the home, Heller never established a categorical
    rule that the Constitution prohibits regulations that forbid firearm
    possession in the home. Indeed, Heller stated that many such prohi-
    bitions, like those on the possession of firearms by “felons and the men-
    tally ill,” are “presumptively lawful.” Heller, 554 U. S., at 626, 627,
    n. 26. And the Court’s conclusion in Bruen that regulations like the
    surety laws are not a proper historical analogue for a broad gun licens-
    ing regime does not mean that they cannot be an appropriate analogue
    for a narrow one. Pp. 13–15.
         (4) The Fifth Circuit erred in reading Bruen to require a “histori-
    cal twin” rather than a “historical analogue.” 597 U. S., at 30. The
    panel also misapplied the Court’s precedents when evaluating
    Rahimi’s facial challenge. Rather than consider the circumstances in
    which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to be constitutional, the panel
    instead focused on hypothetical scenarios where the provision might
    raise constitutional concerns. P. 16.
         (5) Finally, the Court rejects the Government’s contention that
    Rahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not “responsible.” The
    Court used this term in Heller and Bruen to describe the class of citi-
    zens who undoubtedly enjoy the Second Amendment right. Those de-
    cisions, however, did not define the term and said nothing about the
    status of citizens who were not “responsible.” P. 17.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                                 [June 21, 2024]

   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
   A federal statute prohibits an individual subject to a do-
mestic violence restraining order from possessing a firearm
if that order includes a finding that he “represents a credi-
ble threat to the physical safety of [an] intimate partner,”
or a child of the partner or individual. 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(8). Respondent Zackey Rahimi is subject to such an
order. The question is whether this provision may be en-
forced against him consistent with the Second Amendment.
                             I
                             A
  In December 2019, Rahimi met his girlfriend, C. M., for
lunch in a parking lot. C. M. is also the mother of Rahimi’s
young child, A. R. During the meal, Rahimi and C. M. be-
gan arguing, and Rahimi became enraged. Brief for United
States 2. C. M. attempted to leave, but Rahimi grabbed her
by the wrist, dragged her back to his car, and shoved her in,
causing her to strike her head against the dashboard.
When he realized that a bystander was watching the alter-
cation, Rahimi paused to retrieve a gun from under the pas-
2                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      Opinion of the Court

senger seat. C. M. took advantage of the opportunity to es-
cape. Rahimi fired as she fled, although it is unclear
whether he was aiming at C. M. or the witness. Rahimi
later called C. M. and warned that he would shoot her if she
reported the incident. Ibid.
  Undeterred by this threat, C. M. went to court to seek a
restraining order. In the affidavit accompanying her appli-
cation, C. M. recounted the parking lot incident as well as
other assaults. She also detailed how Rahimi’s conduct had
endangered A. R. Although Rahimi had an opportunity to
contest C. M.’s testimony, he did not do so. On February 5,
2020, a state court in Tarrant County, Texas, issued a re-
straining order against him. The order, entered with the
consent of both parties, included a finding that Rahimi had
committed “family violence.” App. 2. It also found that this
violence was “likely to occur again” and that Rahimi posed
“a credible threat” to the “physical safety” of C. M. or A. R.
Id., at 2–3. Based on these findings, the order prohibited
Rahimi from threatening C. M. or her family for two years
or contacting C. M. during that period except to discuss
A. R. Id., at 3–7. It also suspended Rahimi’s gun license
for two years. Id., at 5–6. If Rahimi was imprisoned or
confined when the order was set to expire, the order would
instead terminate either one or two years after his release
date, depending on the length of his imprisonment. Id., at
6–7.
  In May, however, Rahimi violated the order by approach-
ing C. M.’s home at night. He also began contacting her
through several social media accounts.
  In November, Rahimi threatened a different woman with
a gun, resulting in a charge for aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon. And while Rahimi was under arrest for
that assault, the Texas police identified him as the suspect
in a spate of at least five additional shootings.
  The first, which occurred in December 2020, arose from
Rahimi’s dealing in illegal drugs. After one of his customers
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            3

                      Opinion of the Court

“started talking trash,” Rahimi drove to the man’s home
and shot into it. Brief for United States 3. While driving
the next day, Rahimi collided with another car, exited his
vehicle, and proceeded to shoot at the other car. Three days
later, he fired his gun in the air while driving through a
residential neighborhood. A few weeks after that, Rahimi
was speeding on a highway near Arlington, Texas, when a
truck flashed its lights at him. Rahimi hit the brakes and
cut across traffic to chase the truck. Once off the highway,
he fired several times toward the truck and a nearby car
before fleeing. Two weeks after that, Rahimi and a friend
were dining at a roadside burger restaurant. When the res-
taurant declined his friend’s credit card, Rahimi pulled a
gun and shot into the air.
  The police obtained a warrant to search Rahimi’s resi-
dence. There they discovered a pistol, a rifle, ammunition—
and a copy of the restraining order.
                              B
   Rahimi was indicted on one count of possessing a firearm
while subject to a domestic violence restraining order, in vi-
olation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8). At the time, such a viola-
tion was punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment (since
amended to 15 years). §924(a)(2); see Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, Pub. L. 117–159, §12004(c)(2), 136 Stat.
1329, 18 U. S. C. §924(a)(8). A prosecution under Section
922(g)(8) may proceed only if three criteria are met. First,
the defendant must have received actual notice and an op-
portunity to be heard before the order was entered.
§922(g)(8)(A). Second, the order must prohibit the defend-
ant from either “harassing, stalking, or threatening” his
“intimate partner” or his or his partner’s child, or “engaging
in other conduct that would place [the] partner in reasona-
ble fear of bodily injury” to the partner or child.
§922(g)(8)(B). A defendant’s “intimate partner[s]” include
his spouse or any former spouse, the parent of his child, and
4                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      Opinion of the Court

anyone with whom he cohabitates or has cohabitated.
§921(a)(32). Third, under Section 922(g)(8)(C), the order
must either contain a finding that the defendant “repre-
sents a credible threat to the physical safety” of his intimate
partner or his or his partner’s child, §922(g)(8)(C)(i), or “by
its terms explicitly prohibit[ ] the use,” attempted use, or
threatened use of “physical force” against those individuals,
§922(g)(8)(C)(ii).
   Rahimi’s restraining order met all three criteria. First,
Rahimi had received notice and an opportunity to be heard
before the order was entered. App. 2. Second, the order
prohibited him from communicating with or threatening
C. M. Id., at 3–4. Third, the order met the requirements of
Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i), because it included a finding that
Rahimi represented “a credible threat to the physical
safety” of C. M. or her family. Id., at 2–3. The order also
“explicitly prohibit[ed]” Rahimi from “the use, attempted
use, or threatened use of physical force” against C. M., sat-
isfying the independent basis for liability in Section
922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Id., at 3.
   Rahimi moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that
Section 922(g)(8) violated on its face the Second Amend-
ment right to keep and bear arms. No. 4:21–cr–00083 (ND
Tex., May 7, 2021), ECF Doc. 17. Concluding that Circuit
precedent foreclosed Rahimi’s Second Amendment chal-
lenge, the District Court denied his motion. Rahimi then
pleaded guilty. On appeal, he again raised his Second
Amendment challenge. The appeal was denied, and Rahimi
petitioned for rehearing en banc.
   While Rahimi’s petition was pending, this Court decided
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.
1 (2022). In Bruen, we explained that when a firearm reg-
ulation is challenged under the Second Amendment, the
Government must show that the restriction “is consistent
with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Id., at 24.
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)             5

                      Opinion of the Court

   In light of Bruen, the panel withdrew the prior opinion
and ordered additional briefing. A new panel then heard
oral argument and reversed. 61 F. 4th 443, 448 (CA5 2023).
Surveying the evidence that the Government had identi-
fied, the panel concluded that Section 922(g)(8) does not fit
within our tradition of firearm regulation. Id., at 460–461.
Judge Ho wrote separately to express his view that the
panel’s ruling did not conflict with the interest in protecting
people from violent individuals. Id., at 461–462 (concurring
opinion).
   We granted certiorari. 600 U. S. ___ (2023)
                               II
   When a restraining order contains a finding that an indi-
vidual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an
intimate partner, that individual may—consistent with the
Second Amendment—be banned from possessing firearms
while the order is in effect. Since the founding, our Nation’s
firearm laws have included provisions preventing individu-
als who threaten physical harm to others from misusing
firearms. As applied to the facts of this case, Section
922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this tradition.
                              A
  We have held that the right to keep and bear arms is
among the “fundamental rights necessary to our system of
ordered liberty.” McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 778
(2010). Derived from English practice and codified in the
Second Amendment, the right secures for Americans a
means of self-defense. Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17. The spark
that ignited the American Revolution was struck at Lexing-
ton and Concord, when the British governor dispatched sol-
diers to seize the local farmers’ arms and powder stores. In
the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress’s desire to enable
the newly freed slaves to defend themselves against former
Confederates helped inspire the passage of the Fourteenth
6                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      Opinion of the Court

Amendment, which secured the right to bear arms against
interference by the States. McDonald, 561 U. S., at 771–
776. As a leading and early proponent of emancipation ob-
served, “Disarm a community and you rob them of the
means of defending life. Take away their weapons of de-
fense and you take away the inalienable right of defending
liberty.” Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967 (1868)
(statement of Rep. Stevens).
   “Like most rights,” though, “the right secured by the Sec-
ond Amendment is not unlimited.” District of Columbia v.
Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008). In Heller, this Court held
that the right applied to ordinary citizens within the home.
Even as we did so, however, we recognized that the right
was never thought to sweep indiscriminately. “From Black-
stone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and
courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to
keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” Ibid. At the found-
ing, the bearing of arms was subject to regulations ranging
from rules about firearm storage to restrictions on gun use
by drunken New Year’s Eve revelers. Act of Mar. 1, 1783,
1783 Mass. Acts and Laws ch.13, pp. 218–219; 5 Colonial
Laws of New York ch. 1501, pp. 244–246 (1894). Some ju-
risdictions banned the carrying of “dangerous and unusual
weapons.” 554 U. S., at 627 (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Com-
mentaries on the Laws of England 148–149 (1769)). Others
forbade carrying concealed firearms. 554 U. S., at 626.
   In Heller, our inquiry into the scope of the right began
with “constitutional text and history.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at
22. In Bruen, we directed courts to examine our “historical
tradition of firearm regulation” to help delineate the con-
tours of the right. Id., at 17. We explained that if a chal-
lenged regulation fits within that tradition, it is lawful un-
der the Second Amendment. We also clarified that when
the Government regulates arms-bearing conduct, as when
the Government regulates other constitutional rights, it
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            7

                      Opinion of the Court

bears the burden to “justify its regulation.” Id., at 24.
   Nevertheless, some courts have misunderstood the meth-
odology of our recent Second Amendment cases. These
precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in am-
ber. As we explained in Heller, for example, the reach of
the Second Amendment is not limited only to those arms
that were in existence at the founding. 554 U. S., at 582.
Rather, it “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that con-
stitute bearable arms, even those that were not [yet] in ex-
istence.” Ibid. By that same logic, the Second Amendment
permits more than just those regulations identical to ones
that could be found in 1791. Holding otherwise would be as
mistaken as applying the protections of the right only to
muskets and sabers.
   As we explained in Bruen, the appropriate analysis in-
volves considering whether the challenged regulation is
consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory
tradition. 597 U. S., at 26–31. A court must ascertain
whether the new law is “relevantly similar” to laws that our
tradition is understood to permit, “apply[ing] faithfully the
balance struck by the founding generation to modern cir-
cumstances.” Id., at 29, and n. 7. Discerning and develop-
ing the law in this way is “a commonplace task for any law-
yer or judge.” Id., at 28.
   Why and how the regulation burdens the right are cen-
tral to this inquiry. Id., at 29. For example, if laws at the
founding regulated firearm use to address particular prob-
lems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws
imposing similar restrictions for similar reasons fall within
a permissible category of regulations. Even when a law reg-
ulates arms-bearing for a permissible reason, though, it
may not be compatible with the right if it does so to an ex-
tent beyond what was done at the founding. And when a
challenged regulation does not precisely match its histori-
cal precursors, “it still may be analogous enough to pass
constitutional muster.” Id., at 30. The law must comport

with the principles underlying the Second Amendment, but
it need not be a “dead ringer” or a “historical twin.” Ibid.

                             B
   Bearing these principles in mind, we conclude that Sec-
tion 922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s challenge.
                               1
  Rahimi challenges Section 922(g)(8) on its face. This is
the “most difficult challenge to mount successfully,” be-
cause it requires a defendant to “establish that no set of cir-
cumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”
United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). That
means that to prevail, the Government need only demon-
strate that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional in some of its
applications. And here the provision is constitutional as ap-
plied to the facts of Rahimi’s own case.
  Recall that Section 922(g)(8) provides two independent
bases for liability. Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) bars an individual
from possessing a firearm if his restraining order includes
a finding that he poses “a credible threat to the physical
safety” of a protected person.           Separately, Section
922(g)(8)(C)(ii) bars an individual from possessing a fire-
arm if his restraining order “prohibits the use, attempted
use, or threatened use of physical force.” Our analysis
starts and stops with Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) because the
Government offers ample evidence that the Second Amend-
ment permits the disarmament of individuals who pose a
credible threat to the physical safety of others. We need not

   1 We also recognized in Bruen the “ongoing scholarly debate on

whether courts should primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of
an individual right when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in
1868 when defining its scope (as well as the scope of the right against the
Federal Government).” 597 U. S., at 37. We explained that under the
circumstances, resolving the dispute was unnecessary to decide the case.
Id., at 37–38. The same is true here.

also permissible.

  This Court reviewed the history of American gun laws ex-
tensively in Heller and Bruen. From the earliest days of the
common law, firearm regulations have included provisions
barring people from misusing weapons to harm or menace
others. The act of “go[ing] armed to terrify the King’s sub-
jects” was recognized at common law as a “great offence.”
Sir John Knight’s Case, 3 Mod. 117, 118, 87 Eng. Rep. 75,
76 (K. B. 1686). Parliament began codifying prohibitions
against such conduct as early as the 1200s and 1300s, most
notably in the Statute of Northampton of 1328. Bruen, 597
U. S., at 40. In the aftermath of the Reformation and the
English Civil War, Parliament passed further restrictions.
The Militia Act of 1662, for example, authorized the King’s
agents to “seize all Armes in the custody or possession of
any person . . . judge[d] dangerous to the Peace of the King-
dome.” 14 Car. 2 c. 3, §13 (1662); J. Greenlee, The Histori-
cal Justification for Prohibiting Dangerous Persons From
Possessing Arms, 20 Wyo. L. Rev. 249, 259 (2020).
  The Glorious Revolution cut back on the power of the
Crown to disarm its subjects unilaterally. King James II
had “caus[ed] several good Subjects being Protestants to be
disarmed at the same Time when Papists were . . . armed.”
1 Wm. & Mary c. 2, §6, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 440 (1689).
By way of rebuke, Parliament adopted the English Bill of
Rights, which guaranteed “that the Subjects which are
Protestants, may have Arms for their Defence suitable to
their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.” §7, id., at 441.
But as the document itself memorialized, the principle that
arms-bearing was constrained “by Law” remained. Ibid.
  Through these centuries, English law had disarmed not
only brigands and highwaymen but also political opponents
10               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     Opinion of the Court

and disfavored religious groups. By the time of the found-
ing, however, state constitutions and the Second Amend-
ment had largely eliminated governmental authority to dis-
arm political opponents on this side of the Atlantic. See
Heller, 554 U. S., at 594–595, 600–603. But regulations tar-
geting individuals who physically threatened others per-
sisted. Such conduct was often addressed through ordinary
criminal laws and civil actions, such as prohibitions on
fighting or private suits against individuals who threatened
others. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England 145–146, 149–150 (10th ed. 1787) (Blackstone); 3
id., at 120. By the 1700s and early 1800s, however, two
distinct legal regimes had developed that specifically ad-
dressed firearms violence.
   The first were the surety laws. A form of “preventive jus-
tice,” these laws derived from the ancient practice of frank-
pledges. 4 id., at 251–253. Reputedly dating to the time of
Canute, the frankpledge system involved compelling adult
men to organize themselves into ten-man “tithing[s].” A.
Lefroy, Anglo-Saxon Period of English Law, Part II, 26 Yale
L. J. 388, 391 (1917). The members of each tithing then
“mutually pledge[d] for each other’s good behaviour.” 4
Blackstone 252. Should any of the ten break the law, the
remaining nine would be responsible for producing him in
court, or else face punishment in his stead. D. Levinson,
Collective Sanctions, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 345, 358 (2003).
   Eventually, the communal frankpledge system evolved
into the individualized surety regime. Under the surety
laws, a magistrate could “oblig[e] those persons, [of] whom
there is a probable ground to suspect of future misbehav-
iour, to stipulate with and to give full assurance . . . that
such offence . . . shall not happen[,] by finding pledges or
securities.” 4 Blackstone 251. In other words, the law au-
thorized magistrates to require individuals suspected of fu-
ture misbehavior to post a bond. Ibid. If an individual
failed to post a bond, he would be jailed. See, e.g., Mass.
                 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)           11

                     Opinion of the Court

Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §6 (1836). If the individual did post a
bond and then broke the peace, the bond would be forfeit. 4
Blackstone 253.
  Well entrenched in the common law, the surety laws
could be invoked to prevent all forms of violence, including
spousal abuse. As Blackstone explained, “[w]ives [could]
demand [sureties] against their husbands; or husbands, if
necessary, against their wives.” Id., at 254. These often
took the form of a surety of the peace, meaning that the de-
fendant pledged to “keep the peace.” Id., at 252–253; see R.
Bloch, The American Revolution, Wife Beating, and the
Emergent Value of Privacy, 5 Early American Studies 223,
232–233, 234–235 (2007) (Bloch) (discussing peace bonds).
Wives also demanded sureties for good behavior, whereby a
husband pledged to “demean and behave himself well.” 4
Blackstone 253; see Bloch 232–233, 234–235, and n. 34.
  While communities sometimes resorted to public sham-
ing or vigilante justice to chastise abusers, sureties pro-
vided the public with a more measured solution. B.
McConville, The Rise of Rough Music, in Riot and Revelry
in Early America 90–100 (W. Pencak, M. Dennis, & S. New-
man eds. 2002). In one widely reported incident, Susannah
Wyllys Strong, the wife of a Connecticut judge, appeared
before Tapping Reeve in 1790 to make a complaint against
her husband. K. Ryan, “The Spirit of Contradiction”: Wife
Abuse in New England, 1780–1820, 13 Early American
Studies 586, 602 (2015). Newspapers carried the story in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. Ibid. Reeve
ultimately ordered the man to post a bond of £1,000. Id., at
603.
  Importantly for this case, the surety laws also targeted
the misuse of firearms. In 1795, for example, Massachu-
setts enacted a law authorizing justices of the peace to “ar-
rest” all who “go armed offensively [and] require of the of-
fender to find sureties for his keeping the peace.” 1795
Mass. Acts ch. 2, in Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts,
12                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      Opinion of the Court

1794–1795, ch. 26, pp. 66–67 (1896). Later, Massachusetts
amended its surety laws to be even more specific, authoriz-
ing the imposition of bonds from individuals “[who went]
armed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive
and dangerous weapon.” Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §16; see
ibid. (marginal note) (referencing the earlier statute). At
least nine other jurisdictions did the same. See Bruen, 597
U. S., at 56, and n. 23.
   These laws often offered the accused significant proce-
dural protections. Before the accused could be compelled to
post a bond for “go[ing] armed,” a complaint had to be made
to a judge or justice of the peace by “any person having rea-
sonable cause to fear” that the accused would do him harm
or breach the peace. Mass. Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §§1, 16. The
magistrate would take evidence, and—if he determined
that cause existed for the charge—summon the accused,
who could respond to the allegations. §§3–4. Bonds could
not be required for more than six months at a time, and an
individual could obtain an exception if he needed his arms
for self-defense or some other legitimate reason. §16.
   While the surety laws provided a mechanism for prevent-
ing violence before it occurred, a second regime provided a
mechanism for punishing those who had menaced others
with firearms. These were the “going armed” laws, a par-
ticular subset of the ancient common-law prohibition on af-
frays.
   Derived from the French word “affraier,” meaning “to ter-
rify,” 4 Blackstone 145, the affray laws traced their origin
to the Statute of Northampton, 2 Edw. 3 c. 3 (1328). Alt-
hough the prototypical affray involved fighting in public,
commentators understood affrays to encompass the offense
of “arm[ing]” oneself “to the Terror of the People,” T. Bar-
low, The Justice of the Peace: A Treatise 11 (1745). Moreo-
ver, the prohibitions—on fighting and going armed—were
often codified in the same statutes. E.g., 2 Edw. 3 c. 3; Acts
and Laws of His Majesty’s Province of New-Hampshire in
                 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)           13

                     Opinion of the Court

New-England 2 (1761).
   Whether classified as an affray law or a distinct prohibi-
tion, the going armed laws prohibited “riding or going
armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to] terrify[ ]
the good people of the land.” 4 Blackstone 149 (emphasis
deleted). Such conduct disrupted the “public order” and
“le[d] almost necessarily to actual violence.” State v.
Huntly, 25 N. C. 418, 421–422 (1843) (per curiam). There-
fore, the law punished these acts with “forfeiture of the
arms . . . and imprisonment.” 4 Blackstone 149.
   In some instances, prohibitions on going armed and af-
frays were incorporated into American jurisprudence
through the common law. See, e.g., Huntly, 25 N. C., at
421–422; O’Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); Hickman v.
State, 193 Md. App. 238, 253–255, 996 A. 2d 974, 983 (2010)
(recognizing that common-law prohibition on fighting in
public remains even now chargeable in Maryland). More-
over, at least four States—Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, and Virginia—expressly codified prohibi-
tions on going armed. 1786 Va. Acts ch. 21; 2 Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts from Nov. 28, 1780 to
Feb. 28, 1807, pp. 652–653 (1807); Acts and Laws of His
Majesty’s Province of New-Hampshire in New-England 2
(1761); Collection of All of the Public Acts of Assembly, of
the Province of North-Carolina: Now in Force and Use 131
(1751) (1741 statute).
                               3
  Taken together, the surety and going armed laws confirm
what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a
clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening
individual may be disarmed. Section 922(g)(8) is by no
means identical to these founding era regimes, but it does
not need to be. See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30. Its prohibition
on the possession of firearms by those found by a court to
present a threat to others fits neatly within the tradition
14               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     Opinion of the Court

the surety and going armed laws represent.
   Like the surety and going armed laws, Section
922(g)(8)(C)(i) applies to individuals found to threaten the
physical safety of another. This provision is “relevantly
similar” to those founding era regimes in both why and how
it burdens the Second Amendment right. Id., at 29. Section
922(g)(8) restricts gun use to mitigate demonstrated
threats of physical violence, just as the surety and going
armed laws do. Unlike the regulation struck down in
Bruen, Section 922(g)(8) does not broadly restrict arms use
by the public generally.
   The burden Section 922(g)(8) imposes on the right to bear
arms also fits within our regulatory tradition. While we do
not suggest that the Second Amendment prohibits the en-
actment of laws banning the possession of guns by catego-
ries of persons thought by a legislature to present a special
danger of misuse, see Heller, 554 U. S., at 626, we note that
Section 922(g)(8) applies only once a court has found that
the defendant “represents a credible threat to the physical
safety” of another. §922(g)(8)(C)(i). That matches the
surety and going armed laws, which involved judicial deter-
minations of whether a particular defendant likely would
threaten or had threatened another with a weapon.
   Moreover, like surety bonds of limited duration, Section
922(g)(8)’s restriction was temporary as applied to Rahimi.
Section 922(g)(8) only prohibits firearm possession so long
as the defendant “is” subject to a restraining order.
§922(g)(8). In Rahimi’s case that is one to two years after
his release from prison, according to Tex. Fam. Code Ann.
§85.025(c) (West 2019). App. 6–7.
   Finally, the penalty—another relevant aspect of the bur-
den—also fits within the regulatory tradition. The going
armed laws provided for imprisonment, 4 Blackstone 149,
and if imprisonment was permissible to respond to the use
of guns to threaten the physical safety of others, then the
lesser restriction of temporary disarmament that Section
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)           15

                      Opinion of the Court

922(g)(8) imposes is also permissible.
   Rahimi argues Heller requires us to affirm, because Sec-
tion 922(g)(8) bars individuals subject to restraining orders
from possessing guns in the home, and in Heller we invali-
dated an “absolute prohibition of handguns . . . in the
home.” 554 U. S., at 636; Brief for Respondent 32. But Hel-
ler never established a categorical rule that the Constitu-
tion prohibits regulations that forbid firearm possession in
the home. In fact, our opinion stated that many such pro-
hibitions, like those on the possession of firearms by “felons
and the mentally ill,” are “presumptively lawful.” 554 U. S.,
at 626, 627, n. 26.
   Our analysis of the surety laws in Bruen also does not
help Rahimi. In Bruen, we explained that the surety laws
were not a proper historical analogue for New York’s gun
licensing regime. 597 U. S., at 55–60. What distinguished
the regimes, we observed, was that the surety laws “pre-
sumed that individuals had a right to . . . carry,” whereas
New York’s law effectively presumed that no citizen had
such a right, absent a special need. Id., at 56 (emphasis
deleted). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) does not make the same
faulty presumption. To the contrary, it presumes, like the
surety laws before it, that the Second Amendment right
may only be burdened once a defendant has been found to
pose a credible threat to the physical safety of others. See
ibid.
   While we also noted that the surety laws applied different
penalties than New York’s special-need regime, we did so
only to emphasize just how severely the State treated the
rights of its citizens. Id., at 57. But as we have explained,
our Nation’s tradition of firearm regulation distinguishes
citizens who have been found to pose a credible threat to
the physical safety of others from those who have not. The
conclusion that focused regulations like the surety laws are
not a historical analogue for a broad prohibitory regime like
16                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      Opinion of the Court

New York’s does not mean that they cannot be an appropri-
ate analogue for a narrow one.
                                4
   In short, we have no trouble concluding that Section
922(g)(8) survives Rahimi’s facial challenge. Our tradition
of firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm in-
dividuals who present a credible threat to the physical
safety of others. Section 922(g)(8) can be applied lawfully
to Rahimi.
   The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, primarily on
the ground that the historical analogues for Section
922(g)(8) are not sufficiently similar to place that provision
in our historical tradition. The dissent does, however,
acknowledge that Section 922(g)(8) is within that tradition
when it comes to the “why” of the appropriate inquiry. The
objection is to the “how.” See post, at 18 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.). For the reasons we have set forth, however,
we conclude that Section 922(g)(8) satisfies that part of the
inquiry as well. See supra, at 7, 13–15. As we said in
Bruen, a “historical twin” is not required. 597 U. S., at 30.
   For its part, the Fifth Circuit made two errors. First, like
the dissent, it read Bruen to require a “historical twin” ra-
ther than a “historical analogue.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted).
Second, it did not correctly apply our precedents governing
facial challenges. 61 F. 4th, at 453. As we have said in
other contexts, “[w]hen legislation and the Constitution
brush up against each other, [a court’s] task is to seek har-
mony, not to manufacture conflict.” United States v. Han-
sen, 599 U. S. 762, 781 (2023). Rather than consider the
circumstances in which Section 922(g)(8) was most likely to
be constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical
scenarios where Section 922(g)(8) might raise constitu-
tional concerns. See 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467 (Ho,
J., concurring). That error left the panel slaying a straw

man.2
                               5
   Finally, in holding that Section 922(g)(8) is constitutional
as applied to Rahimi, we reject the Government’s conten-
tion that Rahimi may be disarmed simply because he is not
“responsible.” Brief for United States 6; see Tr. of Oral Arg.
8–11. “Responsible” is a vague term. It is unclear what
such a rule would entail. Nor does such a line derive from
our case law. In Heller and Bruen, we used the term “re-
sponsible” to describe the class of ordinary citizens who un-
doubtedly enjoy the Second Amendment right. See, e.g.,
Heller, 554 U. S., at 635; Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70. But those
decisions did not define the term and said nothing about the
status of citizens who were not “responsible.” The question
was simply not presented.
                       *     *    *
  In Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, this Court did not “un-
dertake an exhaustive historical analysis . . . of the full
scope of the Second Amendment.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 31.
Nor do we do so today. Rather, we conclude only this: An
individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to the
physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed
consistent with the Second Amendment.
  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit


——————
   2 Many of the potential faults that the Fifth Circuit identifies in Section

922(g)(8) appear to sound in due process rather than the Second Amend-
ment. E.g., 61 F. 4th, at 459; id., at 465–467 (Ho, J., concurring). As we
have explained, unless these hypothetical faults occur in every case, they
do not justify invalidating Section 922(g)(8) on its face. See United States
v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (a facial challenge fails if the law is
constitutional in at least some of its applications). In any event, we need
not address any due process concern here because this challenge was not
litigated as a due process challenge and there is no such claim before us.
See this Court’s Rule 14.1(a).

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                         [June 21, 2024]

  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,
concurring.
  Today, the Court applies its decision in New York State
Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022), for
the first time. Although I continue to believe that Bruen
was wrongly decided, see id., at 83–133 (Breyer, J., joined
by SOTOMAYOR and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting), I join the
Court’s opinion applying that precedent to uphold 18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8).
  The Court today emphasizes that a challenged regulation
“must comport with the principles underlying the Second
Amendment,” but need not have a precise historical match.
Ante, at 7–8. I agree. I write separately to highlight why
the Court’s interpretation of Bruen, and not the dissent’s, is
the right one. In short, the Court’s interpretation permits
a historical inquiry calibrated to reveal something useful
and transferable to the present day, while the dissent would
make the historical inquiry so exacting as to be useless, a
too-sensitive alarm that sounds whenever a regulation did
not exist in an essentially identical form at the founding.
                             I
  Even under Bruen, this is an easy case. Section 922(g)(8)
prohibits an individual subject to a domestic violence re-
straining order from possessing a firearm, so long as certain
criteria are met. See ante, at 3–4. Section 922(g)(8) is
2                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

wholly consistent with the Nation’s history and tradition of
firearm regulation.
   The Court correctly concludes that “the Second Amend-
ment permits the disarmament of individuals who pose a
credible threat to the physical safety of others.” Ante, at 8.
That conclusion finds historical support in both the surety
laws, which “provided a mechanism for preventing violence
before it occurred” by requiring an individual who posed a
credible threat of violence to another to post a surety, and
the “going armed” laws, which “provided a mechanism for
punishing those who had menaced others with firearms”
through forfeiture of the arms or imprisonment. Ante, at
12. “Taken together, the surety and going armed laws con-
firm what common sense suggests: When an individual
poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the
threatening individual may be disarmed.” Ante, at 13. Sec-
tion 922(g)(8)’s prohibition on gun possession for individu-
als subject to domestic violence restraining orders is part of
that “tradition of firearm regulation allow[ing] the Govern-
ment to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to
the physical safety of others,” ante, at 16, as are the similar
restrictions that have been adopted by 48 States and Terri-
tories, see Brief for United States 34–35, and nn. 22–23 (col-
lecting statutes).
   The Court’s opinion also clarifies an important methodo-
logical point that bears repeating: Rather than asking
whether a present-day gun regulation has a precise histor-
ical analogue, courts applying Bruen should “conside[r]
whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the
principles that underpin our regulatory tradition.” Ante, at
7 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 7–8 (“The law must
comport with the principles underlying the Second Amend-
ment, but it need not be a ‘dead ringer’ or a ‘historical twin’ ”
(quoting Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30)). Here, for example,
the Government has not identified a founding-era or
Reconstruction-era law that specifically disarmed domestic

abusers, see, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (conceding as much),
but it did not need to do so. Although §922(g)(8) “is by no
means identical” to the surety or going armed laws, ante, at
13, it “restricts gun use to mitigate demonstrated threats of
physical violence, just as the surety and going armed laws
d[id],” ante, at 14. That shared principle is sufficient.
                                II
   The dissent reaches a different conclusion by applying
the strictest possible interpretation of Bruen. It picks off
the Government’s historical sources one by one, viewing
any basis for distinction as fatal. See, e.g., post, at 18 (opin-
ion of THOMAS, J.) (“Although surety laws shared a common
justification with §922(g)(8), surety laws imposed a materi-
ally different burden”); post, at 25–26 (explaining that
“[a]ffray laws are wide of the mark” because they “expressly
carve out the very conduct §922(g)(8) was designed to pre-
vent (interpersonal violence in the home)”). The dissent
urges a close look “at the historical law’s justification as ar-
ticulated during the relevant time period,” post, at 28, and
a “careful parsing of regulatory burdens” to ensure that
courts do not “stray too far from [history] by eliding mate-
rial differences between historical and modern laws,” post,
at 15. The dissent criticizes this Court for adopting a more
“piecemeal approach” that distills principles from a variety
of historical evidence rather than insisting on a precise his-
torical analogue. Post, at 21.
   If the dissent’s interpretation of Bruen were the law, then
Bruen really would be the “one-way ratchet” that I and the
other dissenters in that case feared, “disqualify[ing] virtu-
ally any ‘representative historical analogue’ and mak[ing]
it nearly impossible to sustain common-sense regulations
necessary to our Nation’s safety and security.” 597 U. S., at
112 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Thankfully, the Court rejects
that rigid approach to the historical inquiry. As the Court
puts it today, Bruen was “not meant to suggest a law
4                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring

trapped in amber.” Ante, at 7.
   This case lays bare the perils of the dissent’s approach.
Because the dissent concludes that “§922(g)(8) addresses a
societal problem—the risk of interpersonal violence—‘that
has persisted since the 18th century,’ ” it insists that the
means of addressing that problem cannot be “ ‘materially
different’ ” from the means that existed in the 18th century.
Post, at 7. That is so, it seems, even when the weapons in
question have evolved dramatically. See R. Roth, Why
Guns Are and Are Not the Problem, in A Right To Bear
Arms?: The Contested Role of History in Contemporary De-
bates on the Second Amendment 117 (J. Tucker, B. Hacker,
& M. Vining eds. 2019) (explaining that guns in the 18th
century took a long time to load, typically fired only one
shot, and often misfired). According to the dissent, the so-
lution cannot be “materially different” even when societal
perception of the problem has changed, and even if it is now
clear to everyone that the historical means of addressing
the problem had been wholly inadequate. Given the fact
that the law at the founding was more likely to protect hus-
bands who abused their spouses than offer some measure
of accountability, see, e.g., R. Siegel, “The Rule of Love”:
Wife Beating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L. J.
2117, 2154–2170 (1996), it is no surprise that that genera-
tion did not have an equivalent to §922(g)(8). Under the
dissent’s approach, the legislatures of today would be lim-
ited not by a distant generation’s determination that such
a law was unconstitutional, but by a distant generation’s
failure to consider that such a law might be necessary. His-
tory has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but
a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating
the inclusion of women and people of color as full members
of the polity), impoverishes constitutional interpretation
and hamstrings our democracy.

                               III
   The Court today clarifies Bruen’s historical inquiry and
rejects the dissent’s exacting historical test. I welcome that
development. That being said, I remain troubled by Bruen’s
myopic focus on history and tradition, which fails to give
full consideration to the real and present stakes of the prob-
lems facing our society today. In my view, the Second
Amendment allows legislators “to take account of the seri-
ous problems posed by gun violence,” Bruen, 597 U. S., at
91 (Breyer, J., dissenting), not merely by asking what their
predecessors at the time of the founding or Reconstruction
thought, but by listening to their constituents and crafting
new and appropriately tailored solutions. Under the
means-end scrutiny that this Court rejected in Bruen but
“regularly use[s] . . . in cases involving other constitutional
provisions,” id., at 106, the constitutionality of §922(g)(8) is
even more readily apparent.*
   To start, the Government has a compelling interest in
keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. A
woman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five
times more likely to be murdered if the abuser has access
to a gun. See A. Kivisto & M. Porter, Firearm Use Increases
Risk of Multiple Victims in Domestic Homicides, 48 J. Am.
Acad. Psychiatry & L. 26 (2020). With over 70 people shot
and killed by an intimate partner each month in the United
States, the seriousness of the problem can hardly be over-
stated. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

——————
  *By “means-end scrutiny,” I refer to the mode of analysis that would
permit courts “to consider the State’s interest in preventing gun violence,
the effectiveness of the contested law in achieving that interest, the de-
gree to which the law burdens the Second Amendment right, and, if ap-
propriate, any less restrictive alternatives.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 131
(Breyer, J., dissenting). Prior to Bruen, the Courts of Appeals would ap-
ply a level of means-end scrutiny “ ‘proportionate to the severity of the
burden that the law imposes on the right’: strict scrutiny if the burden is
severe, and intermediate scrutiny if it is not.” Id., at 103.

WISQARS Nat. Violent Death Reporting System, Violent
Deaths Report 2020, https://wisqars.cdc.gov/nvdrs (show-
ing that 863 people were killed with a firearm by a spouse
or other intimate partner in 2020). Because domestic vio-
lence is rarely confined to the intimate partner that receives
the protective order, the Government’s interest extends
even further. In roughly a quarter of cases where an abuser
killed an intimate partner, the abuser also killed someone
else, such as a child, family member, or roommate. See S.
Smith, K. Fowler, & P. Niolon, Intimate Partner Homicide
and Corollary Victims in 16 States: National Violent Death
Reporting System, 2003–2009, 104 Am. J. Pub. Health 461,
463–464 (2014). Moreover, one study found that domestic
disputes were the most dangerous type of call for respond-
ing officers, causing more officer deaths with a firearm than
any other type of call. See N. Breul & M. Keith, Deadly
Calls and Fatal Encounters: Analysis of U. S. Law Enforce-
ment Line of Duty Deaths When Officers Responded to Dis-
patched Calls for Service and Conducted Enforcement,
2010–2014, p. 15 (2016).
   While the Second Amendment does not yield automati-
cally to the Government’s compelling interest, §922(g)(8) is
tailored to the vital objective of keeping guns out of the
hands of domestic abusers. See ante, at 3–4, 14. Section
922(g)(8) should easily pass constitutional muster under
any level of scrutiny.
   Although I continue to think that the means-end ap-
proach to Second Amendment analysis is the right one, nei-
ther party asks the Court to reconsider Bruen at this time,
and that question would of course involve other considera-
tions than whether Bruen was rightly decided. Whether
considered under Bruen or under means-end scrutiny,
§922(g)(8) clears the constitutional bar. I join in full the
Court’s opinion, which offers a more helpful model than the
dissent for lower courts struggling to apply Bruen.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                         [June 21, 2024]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring.
   Mr. Rahimi pursues the “most difficult challenge to
mount successfully”: a facial challenge. United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). He contends that 18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment “in all
its applications.” Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. 119, 138
(2019). To prevail, he must show “no set of circumstances”
exists in which that law can be applied without violating
the Second Amendment. Salerno, 481 U. S., at 745. I agree
with the Court that he has failed to make that showing.
Ante, at 8.
   That is not because the Constitution has little to say
about the matter. The Second Amendment protects the
“right of the people to keep and bear Arms.” “ ‘[T]ext and
history’ ” dictate the contours of that right. Ante, at 6 (quot-
ing New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597
U. S. 1, 22 (2022)). As this Court has recognized, too, the
Amendment’s text “ ‘guarantee[s] the individual right to
possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.’ ” Id.,
at 32 (quoting District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570,
592 (2008)). And where that “text covers an individual’s
conduct,” a law regulating that conduct may be upheld only
if it is “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of
firearms regulation.” 597 U. S., at 17; see ante, at 6.
   In this case, no one questions that the law Mr. Rahimi
challenges addresses individual conduct covered by the text
2                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    GORSUCH, J., concurring

of the Second Amendment. So, in this facial challenge, the
question becomes whether that law, in at least some of its
applications, is consistent with historic firearm regulations.
To prevail, the government need not show that the current
law is a “ ‘dead ringer’ ” for some historical analogue. Ante,
at 8 (quoting Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30). But the government
must establish that, in at least some of its applications, the
challenged law “impose[s] a comparable burden on the right
of armed self-defense” to that imposed by a historically rec-
ognized regulation. Id., at 29; see ante, at 7. And it must
show that the burden imposed by the current law “is com-
parably justified.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 29; see ante, at 7.
   Why do we require those showings? Through them, we
seek to honor the fact that the Second Amendment “codified
a pre-existing right” belonging to the American people, one
that carries the same “scope” today that it was “understood
to have when the people adopted” it. Heller, 554 U. S., at
592, 634–635. When the people ratified the Second Amend-
ment, they surely understood an arms-bearing citizenry
posed some risks. But just as surely they believed that the
right protected by the Second Amendment was itself vital
to the preservation of life and liberty. See, e.g., 1 Black-
stone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 300 (St. George Tucker
ed. 1803) (observing that the Second Amendment may rep-
resent the “palladium of liberty,” for “[t]he right of self de-
fence is the first law of nature,” and “in most governments[,]
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within
the narrowest limits”); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution of the United States §1890, p. 746 (1833) (“The
right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been
considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic”).
   We have no authority to question that judgment. As
judges charged with respecting the people’s directions in
the Constitution—directions that are “trapped in amber,”
see ante, at 7—our only lawful role is to apply them in the
cases that come before us. Developments in the world may
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            3

                    GORSUCH, J., concurring

change, facts on the ground may evolve, and new laws may
invite new challenges, but the Constitution the people
adopted remains our enduring guide. Bruen, 597 U. S., at
27–28; see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. 400, 404–
405 (2012); Caetano v. Massachusetts, 577 U. S. 411, 411–
412 (2016) (per curiam). If changes are to be made to the
Constitution’s directions, they must be made by the Ameri-
can people. Nor is there anything remotely unusual about
any of this. Routinely, litigants and courts alike must con-
sult history when seeking to discern the meaning and scope
of a constitutional provision.          See post, at 6–16
(KAVANAUGH, J., concurring) (offering examples). And
when doing so, litigants and courts “must exercise care.”
See post, at 3, n. (BARRETT, J., concurring).
  Consider just one example. We have recognized that the
Sixth Amendment enshrines another pre-existing right:
the right of a defendant to confront his accusers at trial.
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 54 (2004). Just as
here, we have recognized that, in placing this right in the
Constitution, the people set its scope, “admitting only those
exceptions established at the time of the founding.” Ibid.
And, just as here, when a party asks us to sustain some
modern exception to the confrontation right, we require
them to point to a close historic analogue to justify it. See
Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–361 (2008). Just as
here, too, we have expressly rejected arguments that courts
should proceed differently, such as by trying to glean from
historic exceptions overarching “policies,” “ ‘purposes,’ ” or
“values” to guide them in future cases. See id., at 374–375
(opinion of Scalia, J.). We have rejected those paths be-
cause the Constitution enshrines the people’s choice to
achieve certain policies, purposes, and values “through very
specific means”: the right of confrontation as originally un-
derstood at the time of the founding. Id., at 375. As we
have put it, a court may not “extrapolate” from the Consti-
tution’s text and history “the values behind [that right], and
4                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     GORSUCH, J., concurring

then . . . enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve
(in the courts’ views) those underlying values.” Ibid. Pro-
ceeding that way, we have warned, risks handing judges a
license to turn “the guarantee of confrontation” into “no
guarantee at all.” Ibid. As there, so too here: Courts must
proceed with care in making comparisons to historic fire-
arms regulations, or else they risk gaming away an individ-
ual right the people expressly preserved for themselves in
the Constitution’s text.
   Proceeding with this well in mind today, the Court rightly
holds that Mr. Rahimi’s facial challenge to §922(g)(8) can-
not succeed. It cannot because, through surety laws and
restrictions on “going armed,” the people in this country
have understood from the start that the government may
disarm an individual temporarily after a “judicial determi-
natio[n]” that he “likely would threaten or ha[s] threatened
another with a weapon.” Ante, at 14. And, at least in some
cases, the statute before us works in the same way and does
so for the same reasons: It permits a court to disarm a per-
son only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that he “repre-
sents a credible threat to the physical safety” of others.
§§922(g)(8)(A), (g)(8)(C)(i). A court, too, may disarm an in-
dividual only for so long as its order is in effect. §922(g)(8).
In short, in at least some applications, the challenged law
does not diminish any aspect of the right the Second
Amendment was originally understood to protect. See
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 24.
   I appreciate that one of our colleagues sees things differ-
ently. Post, at 6–7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). But if reason-
able minds can disagree whether §922(g)(8) is analogous to
past practices originally understood to fall outside the Sec-
ond Amendment’s scope, we at least agree that is the only
proper question a court may ask. Post, at 5. Discerning
what the original meaning of the Constitution requires in
this or that case may sometimes be difficult. Asking that
question, however, at least keeps judges in their proper
                   Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)              5

                     GORSUCH, J., concurring

lane, seeking to honor the supreme law the people have or-
dained rather than substituting our will for theirs. And
whatever indeterminacy may be associated with seeking to
honor the Constitution’s original meaning in modern dis-
putes, that path offers surer footing than any other this
Court has attempted from time to time. Come to this Court
with arguments from text and history, and we are bound to
reason through them as best we can. (As we have today.)
Allow judges to reign unbounded by those materials, or per-
mit them to extrapolate their own broad new principles
from those sources, and no one can have any idea how they
might rule. (Except the judges themselves.) Faithful ad-
herence to the Constitution’s original meaning may be an
imperfect guide, but I can think of no more perfect one for
us to follow.
   Just consider how lower courts approached the Second
Amendment before our decision in Bruen. They reviewed
firearm regulations under a two-step test that quickly “de-
volved” into an interest-balancing inquiry, where courts
would weigh a law’s burden on the right against the bene-
fits the law offered. See Rogers v. Grewal, 590 U. S. ___,
___, and n. 1 (2020) (THOMAS, J., joined by KAVANAUGH, J.,
dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5, and n. 1);
see also, e.g., Peruta v. County of San Diego, 742 F. 3d 1144,
1167–1168, 1176–1177 (CA9 2014); Drake v. Filko, 724
F. 3d 426, 457 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting). Some
judges expressed concern that the prevailing two-step test
had become “just window dressing for judicial policymak-
ing.” Duncan v. Bonta, 19 F. 4th 1087, 1148 (CA9 2021) (en
banc) (Bumatay, J., dissenting). To them, the inquiry
worked as a “black box regime” that gave a judge broad li-
cense to support policies he “[f]avored” and discard those he
disliked. Ibid. How did the government fare under that
regime? In one circuit, it had an “undefeated, 50–0 record.”
Id., at 1167, n. 8 (VanDyke, J., dissenting). In Bruen, we
rejected that approach for one guided by constitutional text
6                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    GORSUCH, J., concurring

and history. 597 U. S., at 19. Perhaps judges’ jobs would
be easier if they could simply strike the policy balance they
prefer. And a principle that the government always wins
surely would be simple for judges to implement. But either
approach would let judges stray far from the Constitution’s
promise. See Heller, 554 U. S., at 634.
    One more point: Our resolution of Mr. Rahimi’s facial
challenge to §922(g)(8) necessarily leaves open the question
whether the statute might be unconstitutional as applied in
“particular circumstances.” Salerno, 481 U. S., at 751. So,
for example, we do not decide today whether the govern-
ment may disarm a person without a judicial finding that
he poses a “credible threat” to another’s physical safety.
§922(g)(8)(C)(i); see ante, at 8. We do not resolve whether
the government may disarm an individual permanently.
See ante, at 14 (stressing that, “like surety bonds of limited
duration, Section 922(g)(8)’s restriction was temporary as
applied to [Mr.] Rahimi”). We do not determine whether
§922(g)(8) may be constitutionally enforced against a per-
son who uses a firearm in self-defense. Notably, the surety
laws that inform today’s decision allowed even an individ-
ual found to pose a threat to another to “obtain an exception
if he needed his arms for self-defense.” Ante, at 12; see also
post, at 23 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Nor do we purport to
approve in advance other laws denying firearms on a cate-
gorical basis to any group of persons a legislature happens
to deem, as the government puts it, “not ‘responsible.’”
Ante, at 17 (quoting Brief for United States 6); see Tr. of
Oral Arg. 31–32; see also post, at 27 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)
(“Not a single Member of the Court adopts the Govern-
ment’s theory”).
    We do not resolve any of those questions (and perhaps
others like them) because we cannot. Article III of the Con-
stitution vests in this Court the power to decide only the
“ ‘actual cas[e]’ ” before us, “ ‘not abstractions.’ ” Public
Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89 (1947). And the case
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            7

                    GORSUCH, J., concurring

before us does not pose the question whether the challenged
statute is always lawfully applied, or whether other stat-
utes might be permissible, but only whether this one has
any lawful scope. Nor should future litigants and courts
read any more into our decision than that. As this Court
has long recognized, what we say in our opinions must “be
taken in connection with the case in which those expres-
sions are used,” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399
(1821), and may not be “stretch[ed] . . . beyond their con-
text,” Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. 118, 141 (2022).
  Among all the opinions issued in this case, its central
messages should not be lost. The Court reinforces the focus
on text, history, and tradition, following exactly the path we
described in Bruen. Ante, at 5–8. And after carefully con-
sulting those materials, the Court “conclude[s] only this”:
“An individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to
the physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed
consistent with the Second Amendment.” Ante, at 17 (em-
phasis added). With these observations, I am pleased to
concur.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                        [June 21, 2024]

  JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, concurring.
  The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights wisely
sought the best of both worlds: democratic self-government
and the protection of individual rights against excesses of
that form of government. In justiciable cases, this Court
determines whether a democratically enacted law or other
government action infringes on individual rights
guaranteed by the Constitution. When performing that
Article III duty, the Court does not implement its own
policy judgments about, for example, free speech or gun
regulation. Rather, the Court interprets and applies the
Constitution by examining text, pre-ratification and post-
ratification history, and precedent. The Court’s opinion
today does just that, and I join it in full.
  The concurring opinions, and the briefs of the parties and
amici in this case, raise important questions about judicial
reliance on text, history, and precedent, particularly in
Second Amendment cases. I add this concurring opinion to
review the proper roles of text, history, and precedent in
constitutional interpretation.
                             I
  The American people established an enduring American
Constitution. The first and most important rule in
constitutional interpretation is to heed the text—that is,
the actual words of the Constitution—and to interpret that
2                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

text according to its ordinary meaning as originally
understood. The text of the Constitution is the “Law of the
Land.” Art. VI. As a general matter, the text of the
Constitution says what it means and means what it says.
And unless and until it is amended, that text controls.
   In many important provisions, the Constitution is a
document of majestic specificity with “strikingly clean
prose.” A. Amar, America’s Constitution xi (2005). Two
Houses of Congress. A House elected every two years.
Senators serve 6-year terms. Two Senators per State. A
State’s equal suffrage in the Senate may not be changed
without the State’s consent. A two-thirds House vote to
expel a Member of the House. The same for the Senate.
Appropriations are made by law. Bicameralism and
presentment. The Presidential veto. The Presidential
pardon. The President serves a 4-year term. A maximum
of two elected terms for a President. The salary of a sitting
President may not be increased or decreased. A vote of a
majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to
remove a President. The President nominates and the
Senate confirms principal executive officers. One Supreme
Court. Tenure and salary protection for Supreme Court
and other federal judges. Two-thirds of each House of
Congress together with three-fourths of the States may
amend the Constitution. Congress meets at noon on
January 3rd unless otherwise specified by Congress. The
District of Columbia votes in Presidential elections. The
list goes on.
   Those and many other constitutional provisions are
relatively clear. And when the “framers of the Constitution
employed words in their natural sense; and where they are
plain and clear, resort to collateral aids to interpretation is
unnecessary and cannot be indulged in to narrow or enlarge
the text.” McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 27 (1892).
   Of course, some provisions of the Constitution are broadly
worded or vague—to put it in Madison’s words, “more or
                 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            3

less obscure and equivocal.” The Federalist No. 37, p. 229
(C. Rossiter ed. 1961).        As Chief Justice Rehnquist
explained, the Constitution is in some parts “obviously not
a specifically worded document but one couched in general
phraseology.” W. Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living
Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693, 697 (1976).
  That is especially true with respect to the broadly worded
or vague individual-rights provisions. (I will use the terms
“broadly worded” and “vague” interchangeably in this
opinion.) For example, the First Amendment provides that
“Congress shall make no law” “abridging the freedom of
speech.” And the Second Amendment, at issue here,
guarantees that “the right of the people to keep and bear
Arms” “shall not be infringed.”
  Read literally, those Amendments might seem to grant
absolute protection, meaning that the government could
never regulate speech or guns in any way. But American
law has long recognized, as a matter of original
understanding and original meaning, that constitutional
rights generally come with exceptions.
  With respect to the First Amendment, for example, this
Court’s “jurisprudence over the past 216”—now 233—
“years has rejected an absolutist interpretation.” Federal
Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S.
449, 482 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); see R. Bork,
Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems,
47 Ind. L. J. 1, 21–22 (1971). From 1791 to the present, “the
First Amendment has permitted restrictions upon the
content of speech in a few limited areas”—including
obscenity, defamation, fraud, and incitement. United
States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 468 (2010) (quotation
marks omitted). So too with respect to the Second
Amendment: “Like most rights, the right secured by the
Second Amendment is not unlimited”; it is “not a right to
keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner
whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”             District of

                               II
  A recurring and difficult issue for judges, therefore, is
how to interpret vague constitutional text. That issue often
arises (as here) in the context of determining exceptions to
textually guaranteed individual rights. To what extent
does the Constitution allow the government to regulate
speech or guns, for example?1
  In many cases, judicial precedent informs or controls the
answer (more on that later). But absent precedent, there
are really only two potential answers to the question of how
to determine exceptions to broadly worded constitutional
rights: history or policy.
  Generally speaking, the historical approach examines the
laws, practices, and understandings from before and after
ratification that may help the interpreter discern the
meaning of the constitutional text and the principles
embodied in that text. The policy approach rests on the
philosophical or policy dispositions of the individual judge.
  History, not policy, is the proper guide.
  For more than 200 years, this Court has relied on history
when construing vague constitutional text in all manner of
constitutional disputes. For good reason. History can
supply evidence of the original meaning of vague text.
History is far less subjective than policy. And reliance on
history is more consistent with the properly neutral judicial
——————
   1 There are two ways to frame this point—either (i) determining the

exceptions to a constitutional right or (ii) determining the affirmative
scope or contours of that constitutional right. Either way, the analysis
is the same—does the constitutional provision, as originally understood,
permit the challenged law? This opinion uses the term “exceptions,”
which underscores that the constitutional baseline is protection of the
textually enumerated right. See Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin
Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)
(stating in a First Amendment case that “it is worth recalling the
language we are applying”).

role than an approach where judges subtly (or not so subtly)
impose their own policy views on the American people.
  Judges are like umpires, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE has aptly
explained. And in a constitutional system that counts on
an independent Judiciary, judges must act like umpires. To
be an umpire, the judge “must stick close to the text and the
history, and their fair implications,” because there “is no
principled way” for a neutral judge “to prefer any claimed
human value to any other.” R. Bork, Neutral Principles and
Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 8 (1971).
History establishes a “criterion that is conceptually quite
separate from the preferences of the judge himself.” A.
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,
864 (1989). When properly applied, history helps ensure
that judges do not simply create constitutional meaning
“out of whole cloth.” A. Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of
Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1183 (1989).2
  Absent precedent, therefore, history guides the
interpretation of vague constitutional text. Of course, this
Court has been deciding constitutional cases for about 230
years, so relevant precedent often exists. As the Court’s
opinions over time amply demonstrate, precedent matters
a great deal in constitutional interpretation.
  I now turn to explaining how courts apply pre-ratification

——————
   2 The historical approach applies when the text is vague. But the text

of the Constitution always controls. So history contrary to clear text is
not to be followed. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 945–959
(1983); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 546–547 (1969); Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 490–495, and n. 5 (1954); cf. Sedition
Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596. In some cases, there may be debate about
whether the relevant text is sufficiently clear to override contrary
historical practices. See, e.g., NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513, 613
(2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“What the majority needs to
sustain its judgment is an ambiguous text and a clear historical practice.
What it has is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical practice”).
The basic principle remains: Text controls over contrary historical
practices.

history, post-ratification history, and precedent when
analyzing vague constitutional text.
                             A
   Pre-ratification history.     When interpreting vague
constitutional text, the Court typically scrutinizes the
stated intentions and understandings of the Framers and
Ratifiers of the Constitution (or, as relevant, the
Amendments). The Court also looks to the understandings
of the American people from the pertinent ratification era.
Those intentions and understandings do not necessarily
determine meaning, but they may be strong evidence of
meaning. See generally, e.g., The Federalist (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961); Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (M.
Farrand ed. 1911); Debates on the Federal Constitution (J.
Elliot ed. 1836).
   Especially for the original Constitution and the Bill of
Rights, the Court also examines the pre-ratification history
in the American Colonies, including pre-ratification laws
and practices. And the Court pays particular attention to
the historical laws and practices in the United States from
Independence in 1776 until ratification in 1788 or 1791.
Pre-ratification American history can shed light on
constitutional meaning in various ways.
   For example, some provisions of the Constitution use
language that appeared in the Articles of Confederation or
state constitutional provisions. And when the language
that appeared in the Articles of Confederation or in state
constitutions is the same as or similar to the language in
the U. S. Constitution, the history of how people understood
the language in the Articles or state constitutions can
inform interpretation of that language in the U. S.
Constitution. See, e.g., Moore v. Harper, 600 U. S. 1, 33
(2023) (the “Framers did not write the Elections Clause on
a blank slate—they instead borrowed from the Articles of
Confederation” as evidenced by their use of “closely
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            7

parallel” language); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.
570, 600–601 (2008) (“Our interpretation is confirmed by
analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that
preceded and immediately followed adoption of the Second
Amendment”); United States Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax
Comm’n, 434 U. S. 452, 460, and n. 10 (1978) (“The history
of interstate agreements under the Articles of
Confederation suggests the same distinction between
‘treaties, alliances, and confederations’ on the one hand,
and ‘agreements and compacts’ on the other,” as the
distinction made in the Constitution’s Treaty and Compact
Clauses).
   Similarly, other pre-ratification national or state laws
and practices may sometimes help an interpreter discern
the meaning of particular constitutional provisions. Those
pre-ratification American laws and practices formed part of
the foundation on which the Framers constructed the
Constitution and Bill of Rights. Indeed, the Constitution
did not displace but largely co-exists with state
constitutions and state laws, except to the extent they
conflict with federal law. See Art. VI.
   On the other hand, some pre-ratification history can be
probative of what the Constitution does not mean. The
Framers drafted and approved many provisions of the
Constitution precisely to depart from rather than adhere to
certain pre-ratification laws, practices, or understandings.
   For example, the “defects” of the Articles of Confederation
inspired some of the key decisions made by the Framers in
Philadelphia and by the First Congress in drafting the Bill
of Rights. The Federalist No. 37, at 224 (J. Madison); see,
e.g., id., at 226 (“the existing Confederation is founded on
principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently
change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure
resting upon it”); PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 594
U. S. 482, 508 (2021) (“When the Framers met in
Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, they sought to create
8                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of
the Articles of Confederation”); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,
542 U. S. 692, 716–717 (2004) (“The Continental Congress
was hamstrung by its inability to ‘cause infractions of
treaties, or of the law of nations to be punished,’ ” and the
“Framers responded by vesting the Supreme Court with
original jurisdiction over ‘all Cases affecting Ambassadors,
other public ministers and Consuls,’ and the First Congress
followed through” (citation omitted)); U. S. Term Limits,
Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 803 (1995) (“After the
Constitutional Convention convened, the Framers were
presented with, and eventually adopted a variation of, a
plan not merely to amend the Articles of Confederation but
to create an entirely new National Government with a
National Executive, National Judiciary, and a National
Legislature” (quotation marks omitted)).
   The pre-ratification history of America’s many objections
to British laws and the system of oppressive British rule
over the Colonies—identified most prominently in the
Declaration of Independence—can likewise inform
interpretation of some of the crucial provisions of the
original Constitution and Bill of Rights.           Compare
Declaration of Independence ¶11 (under British rule, the
King “made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the
tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their
salaries”) with U. S. Const., Art. III, §1 (“The Judges, both
of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices
during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive
for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be
diminished during their Continuance in Office”); see, e.g.,
The Federalist No. 37, at 226 (“The most that the
convention could do” “was to avoid the errors suggested by
the past experience of other countries, as well as of our
own”); 1 Annals of Cong. 436 (1789) (J. Madison) (“The
freedom of the press and rights of conscience, those choicest
privileges of the people, are unguarded in the British

Constitution”).
   This Court has recognized, for example, that no “purpose
in ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of
securing for the people of the United States much greater
freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than
the people of Great Britain had ever enjoyed.” Bridges
v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 265 (1941). Ratified as it was
“while the memory of many oppressive English restrictions
on the enumerated liberties was still fresh,” the Bill of
Rights “cannot reasonably be taken as approving prevalent
English practices.”      Ibid.; see, e.g., Hosanna-Tabor
Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565
U. S. 171, 183 (2012) (“Familiar with life under the
established Church of England, the founding generation
sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church”
through the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause);
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 60 (1932) (right to counsel
under the Sixth Amendment reflected America’s rejection
of the English common law rule that a “person charged with
treason or felony was denied the aid of counsel”).3
——————
  3 To be sure, as the Court’s cases reveal, pre-ratification English law

and practices may supply background for some constitutional provisions.
But the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, did not purport to take
English law or history wholesale and silently download it into the U. S.
Constitution. See, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 975 (1991)
(opinion of Scalia, J.) (“Unless one accepts the notion of a blind
incorporation, however, the ultimate question is not what ‘cruell and
unusuall punishments’ meant in the [English] Declaration of Rights, but
what its meaning was to the Americans who adopted the Eighth
Amendment”). Therefore, reflexively resorting to English law or history
without careful analysis can sometimes be problematic because America
had fought a war—and would soon fight another in 1812—to free itself
from British law and practices and rid itself of tyrannical British rule.
See The Federalist No. 45, p. 289 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison)
(“Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the American
Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the
hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of
America should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety,” but that they should
10                   UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                       KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

  The Equal Protection Clause provides another example.
Ratified in 1868, that Clause sought to reject the Nation’s
history of racial discrimination, not to backdoor incorporate
racially discriminatory and oppressive historical practices
and laws into the Constitution. See generally Flowers v.
Mississippi, 588 U. S. 284 (2019); Batson v. Kentucky, 476
U. S. 79 (1986); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967);
Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).
  In short, pre-ratification American history—that is, pre-
ratification laws, practices, and understandings—can
inform interpretation of vague constitutional provisions in
the original Constitution and Bill of Rights. The same
principle of looking to relevant pre-ratification history
applies when interpreting broadly worded language in the
later amendments, including the Fourteenth Amendment
ratified in 1868. But in using pre-ratification history,
courts must exercise care to rely only on the history that
the Constitution actually incorporated and not on the
history that the Constitution left behind.
                              B
  Post-ratification history. As the Framers made clear, and
as this Court has stated time and again for more than two
centuries, post-ratification history—sometimes referred to
as tradition—can also be important for interpreting vague
constitutional text and determining exceptions to
individual constitutional rights. When the text is vague
and the pre-ratification history is elusive or inconclusive,
post-ratification history becomes especially important.
Indeed, absent precedent, there can be little else to guide a
judge deciding a constitutional case in that situation,
unless the judge simply defaults to his or her own policy
preferences.
  After ratification, the National Government and the state

continue to be subject to the “impious doctrine in the old world, that the
people were made for kings, not kings for the people”?).

                       KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

governments began interpreting and applying the
Constitution’s text. They have continued to do so ever
since. As the national and state governments over time
have enacted laws and implemented practices to promote
the general welfare, those laws and practices have often
reflected and reinforced common understandings of the
Constitution’s authorizations and limitations.
   Post-ratification interpretations and applications by
government actors—at least when reasonably consistent
and longstanding—can be probative of the meaning of
vague constitutional text. The collective understanding of
Americans who, over time, have interpreted and applied the
broadly worded constitutional text can provide good
guidance for a judge who is trying to interpret that same
text decades or centuries later. See, e.g., Republican Party
of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 785 (2002) (a “universal
and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain
conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition
is constitutional” (quotation marks omitted)); United States
v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459, 472–473 (1915) (“officers,
law-makers and citizens naturally adjust themselves to any
long-continued action” of the government “on the
presumption that” unconstitutional “acts would not have
been allowed to be so often repeated as to crystallize into a
regular practice”); McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, 27
(1892)     (when      constitutional    text    is    vague,
“contemporaneous and subsequent practical construction
are entitled to the greatest weight”).4
——————
   4 Post-ratification history is sometimes also referred to as tradition,

liquidation, or historical gloss. Those concepts are probably not identical
in all respects. In any event, in applying those concepts in constitutional
interpretation, some important questions can arise, such as: (i) the level
of generality at which to define a historical practice; (ii) how widespread
a historical practice must have been; (iii) how long ago it must have
started; and (iv) how long it must have endured.
   Although this Court’s constitutional precedents routinely rely on post-
ratification history, those precedents do not supply a one-size-fits-all
12                   UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                       KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

   Importantly, the Framers themselves intended that post-
ratification history would shed light on the meaning of
vague constitutional text. They understood that some
constitutional text may be “more or less obscure and
equivocal” such that questions “daily occur in the course of
practice.” The Federalist No. 37, at 228–229. Madison
explained that the meaning of vague text would be
“liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular
discussions and adjudications.” Id., at 229. In other words,
Madison articulated the Framers’ expectation and intent
that post-ratification history would be a proper and
important tool to help constitutional interpreters determine
the meaning of vague constitutional text.
   From early on, this Court followed Madison’s lead. In
1819, in one of its most important decisions ever, the Court
addressed the scope of Article I’s Necessary and Proper
Clause. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).
Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall invoked post-
ratification history to conclude that Congress’s authority to
establish a national bank could “scarcely be considered as
an open question.” Id., at 401. The constitutionality of the
——————
answer to those various methodological questions. See, e.g., Noel
Canning, 573 U. S., at 522–556; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S. 579, 610–611 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
  And I will not attempt to answer all of those questions here. Respected
scholars are continuing to undertake careful analysis. See generally J.
Alicea, Practice-Based Constitutional Theories, 133 Yale L. J. 568 (2023);

national bank had “been recognised by many successive
legislatures,” and an “exposition of the constitution,
deliberately established by legislative acts, on the faith of
which an immense property has been advanced, ought not
to be lightly disregarded.” Ibid. Marshall added: The
“respective powers of those who are equally the
representatives of the people, are to be adjusted; if not put
at rest by the practice of the government, ought to receive a
considerable impression from that practice.” Ibid.
  In relying on post-ratification history as a proper tool to
discern constitutional meaning, Madison and Marshall
make for a formidable duo. Moving from distant American
history to more recent times, one can add Justice Scalia.
Throughout his consequential 30-year tenure on this Court,
Justice Scalia repeatedly emphasized that constitutional
interpretation must take account of text, pre-ratification
history, and post-ratification history—the last of which he
often referred to as “tradition.” In his words, when judges
interpret vague or broadly worded constitutional text, the
“traditions of our people” are “paramount.” McDonald v.
Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 792 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring).
Constitutional interpretation should reflect “the principles
adhered to, over time, by the American people, rather than
those favored by the personal (and necessarily shifting)
philosophical dispositions of a majority of this Court.”
Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 96 (1990)
(Scalia, J., dissenting).
  The U. S. Reports are well stocked with Scalia opinions
looking to post-ratification history and tradition.5 In Heller,
——————
  5 Justice Scalia’s opinions “made extensive use of post-ratification

history,” and “his assessment of post-ratification history” in those
opinions extended “far beyond the time of enactment.” M. Ramsey,
Beyond the Text: Justice Scalia’s Originalism in Practice, 92 Notre Dame
L. Rev. 1945, 1957, 1960 (2017). Justice Scalia did not necessarily “use[ ]
tradition as an independent source of interpretive authority; rather, he
had a very broad view of what traditions might be indicative of original
14                    UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                        KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

Justice Scalia wrote for the Court that “a critical tool of
constitutional interpretation” is “the examination of a
variety of legal and other sources to determine the public
understanding of a legal text in the period after its
enactment or ratification.” 554 U. S., at 605 (emphasis in
original); see also ibid. (“We now address how the Second
Amendment was interpreted from immediately after its
ratification through the end of the 19th century”).
   Heller echoed years of earlier Scalia opinions. To take
one: “Where the meaning of a constitutional text (such as
‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the widespread and long-
accepted practices of the American people are the best
indication of what fundamental beliefs it was intended to
enshrine.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S.
334, 378 (1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Or another: A
“venerable and accepted tradition is not to be laid on the
——————
meaning.” Id., at 1962, n. 79; see, e.g., NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S.
513, 584–593, 602–615 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);

examining table and scrutinized for its conformity to some
abstract principle” of “adjudication devised by this Court.
To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out
of which the Court’s principles are to be formed. They are,
in these uncertain areas, the very points of reference by
which the legitimacy or illegitimacy of other practices is to
be figured out.” Rutan, 497 U. S., at 95–96 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting) (emphasis in original).
   As leading actors and theorists in the earliest and latest
chapters of the American constitutional story, Madison,
Marshall, and Scalia made clear that courts should look to
post-ratification history as well as pre-ratification history
to interpret vague constitutional text.
   For more than two centuries—from the early 1800s to
this case—this Court has done just that. The Court has
repeatedly employed post-ratification history to determine
the meaning of vague constitutional text. Reliance on post-
ratification history “has shaped scores of Court cases
spanning all domains of constitutional law, every era of the
nation’s history, and Justices of every stripe.” S. Girgis,

   6 The Court has similarly relied on history when deciding cases

involving textually unenumerated rights under the Due Process Clause
or the Privileges or Immunities Clause. In those contexts, the baseline
is 180-degrees different: The text supplies no express protection of any
asserted substantive right. The Court has recognized exceptions to that
textual baseline, but in doing so has regularly observed that the
Fourteenth Amendment “specially protects those fundamental rights
and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721 (1997)
(quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S.
510, 534–535 (1925) (“liberty of parents and guardians to direct the
upbringing and education of children under their control”).

                              C
   Precedent. With a Constitution and a Supreme Court
that are both more than two centuries old, this Court and
other courts are rarely interpreting a constitutional
provision for the first time. Rather, a substantial body of
Supreme Court precedent already exists for many
provisions of the Constitution.
   Precedent is fundamental to day-to-day constitutional
decisionmaking in this Court and every American court.
The “judicial Power” established in Article III incorporates
the principle of stare decisis, both vertical and horizontal.
As Hamilton stated, to “avoid an arbitrary discretion in the
courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down
by strict rules and precedents” that will “unavoidably swell
to a very considerable bulk” and “serve to define and point
out their duty in every particular case that comes before
them.” The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).
   Courts must respect precedent, while at the same time
recognizing that precedent on occasion may appropriately
be overturned. See, e.g., Brown, 347 U. S. 483; West Coast
Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937); see also Ramos
v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. 83, 115–132 (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,
concurring in part). In light of the significant amount of
Supreme Court precedent that has built up over time, this
Court and other courts often decide constitutional cases by
reference to those extensive bodies of precedent.
   Even then, however, text and history still matter a great
deal. When determining how broadly or narrowly to read a
precedent; when determining whether to extend, limit, or
narrow a precedent; or in relatively infrequent cases, when
determining whether to overrule a precedent, a court often
will consider how the precedent squares with the
Constitution’s text and history. Therefore, the text, as well
as pre-ratification and post-ratification history, may
appropriately function as a gravitational pull on the Court’s
interpretation of precedent. See Free Enterprise Fund
18               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                  KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 537 F. 3d
667, 698 (CADC 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (“We
should resolve questions about the scope of those
precedents in light of and in the direction of the
constitutional text and constitutional history”).
   But the first stop in this Court’s constitutional
decisionmaking      is   the    Court’s     precedents—the
accumulated wisdom of jurists from Marshall and Story to
Harlan and Taft; from Hughes and Black to Jackson and
White; from Rehnquist and O’Connor to Kennedy and
Scalia; and so on.
                              III
  Some say that courts should determine exceptions to
broadly worded individual rights, including the Second
Amendment, by looking to policy. Uphold a law if it is a
good idea; strike it down if it is not. True, the proponents
of a policy-based approach to interpretation of broadly
worded or vague constitutional text usually do not say so
explicitly (although some do). Rather, they support a
balancing approach variously known as means-end
scrutiny, heightened scrutiny, tiers of scrutiny, rational
basis with bite, or strict or intermediate or intermediate-
plus or rigorous or skeptical scrutiny. Whatever the label
of the day, that balancing approach is policy by another
name. It requires judges to weigh the benefits against the
burdens of a law and to uphold the law as constitutional if,
in the judge’s view, the law is sufficiently reasonable or
important. See M. Barnes & E. Chemerinsky, The Once
and Future Equal Protection Doctrine?, 43 Conn. L. Rev.
1059, 1080 (2011) (“The levels of scrutiny are essentially
balancing tests”).
  To begin, as I have explained, that kind of balancing
approach to constitutional interpretation departs from
what Framers such as Madison stated, what jurists such as
Marshall and Scalia did, what judges as umpires should
                      Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)                      19

                        KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

strive to do, and what this Court has actually done across
the constitutional landscape for the last two centuries.
   The balancing tests (heightened scrutiny and the like)
are a relatively modern judicial innovation in constitutional
decisionmaking. The “tiers of scrutiny have no basis in the
text or original meaning of the Constitution.” J. Alicea & J.
Ohlendorf, Against the Tiers of Constitutional Scrutiny,
National Affairs 72, 73 (2019). And before the late 1950s,
“what we would now call strict judicial scrutiny did not
exist.” R. Fallon, The Nature of Constitutional Rights: The
Invention and Logic of Strict Judicial Scrutiny 30 (2019).
   The Court “appears to have adopted” heightened-scrutiny
tests “by accident” in the 1950s and 1960s in a series of
Communist speech cases, “rather than as the result of a
considered judgment.” Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members
of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 125 (1991)
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The Court has
employed balancing only in discrete areas of constitutional
law—and even in those cases, history still tends to play a
far larger role than overt judicial policymaking.7
   To be clear, I am not suggesting that the Court overrule
cases where the Court has applied those heightened-
scrutiny tests. But I am challenging the notion that those

——————
   7 The Court has articulated a heightened-scrutiny test in some pockets

of free-speech jurisprudence. But even when invoking heightened
scrutiny in that context, the Court still often relies directly on history.
See, e.g., City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596
U. S. 61, 75 (2022) (a city’s regulation of solely off-premises billboards
was within “the Nation’s history of regulating off-premises signs” as
“federal, state, and local jurisdictions have repeatedly relied upon on-/off-
premises distinctions” “for the last 50-plus years”); Perry Ed. Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45–46 (1983) (“In places
which by long tradition” “have been devoted to assembly and debate, the
rights of the State to limit expressive activity are sharply
circumscribed”). The Court has also used heightened scrutiny in certain
equal protection cases. As discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause
rejected the history of racially discriminatory laws and practices.
20               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

tests are the ordinary approach to constitutional
interpretation. And I am arguing against extending those
tests to new areas, including the Second Amendment.
   One major problem with using a balancing approach to
determine exceptions to constitutional rights is that it
requires highly subjective judicial evaluations of how
important a law is—at least unless the balancing test itself
incorporates history, in which case judges might as well just
continue to rely on history directly.
   The subjective balancing approach forces judges to act
more like legislators who decide what the law should be,
rather than judges who “say what the law is.” Marbury v.
Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). That is because the
balancing approach requires judges to weigh the benefits of
a law against its burdens—a value-laden and political task
that is usually reserved for the political branches. And that
power in essence vests judges with “a roving commission to
second-guess” legislators and administrative officers
“concerning what is best for the country.” W. Rehnquist,
The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693,
698 (1976). Stated otherwise, when a court “does not have
a solid textual anchor or an established social norm from
which to derive the general rule, its pronouncement
appears uncomfortably like legislation.” A. Scalia, The
Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1185
(1989).
   Moreover, the balancing approach is ill-defined. Some
judges will apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption
in favor of deference to the legislature. Other judges will
apply heightened scrutiny with a presumption in favor of
the individual right in question. Because it is unmoored,
the balancing approach presents the real “danger” that
“judges will mistake their own predilections for the law.” A.
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849,
863 (1989). Under the balancing approach, to use Justice
Scalia’s characteristically vivid description, if “We The
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            21

Court conclude that They The People’s answers to a
problem” are unwise, “we are free to intervene,” but if we
“think the States may be on to something, we can loosen the
leash.” McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 803 (2010)
(concurring opinion) (quotation marks omitted).
   The balancing approach can be antithetical to the
principle that judges must act like umpires. It turns judges
into players. Justice Black once protested that the Court
should not balance away bedrock free speech protections for
the perceived policy needs of the moment. He argued that
“the balancing approach” “disregards all of the unique
features of our Constitution” by giving “the Court, along
with Congress, a greater power, that of overriding the plain
commands of the Bill of Rights on a finding of weighty
public interest.” H. Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L.
Rev. 865, 878–879 (1960). Like Justice Black, the Court in
Heller cautioned that a “constitutional guarantee subject to
future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no
constitutional guarantee at all.” 554 U. S. 570, 634 (2008).
   Some respond that history can be difficult to decipher. It
is true that using history to interpret vague text can require
“nuanced judgments,” McDonald, 561 U. S., at 803–804
(Scalia, J., concurring), and is “sometimes inconclusive,”
Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev., at
864. But at a minimum, history tends to narrow the range
of possible meanings that may be ascribed to vague
constitutional language. A history-based methodology
supplies direction and imposes a neutral and
democratically      infused      constraint     on     judicial
decisionmaking.
   The historical approach is not perfect. But “the question
to be decided is not whether the historically focused method
is a perfect means of restraining aristocratic judicial
Constitution-writing; but whether it is the best means
available in an imperfect world.” McDonald, 561 U. S., at
804 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). And the
22                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

historical approach is superior to judicial policymaking.
The historical approach “depends upon a body of evidence
susceptible of reasoned analysis rather than a variety of
vague ethico-political First Principles whose combined
conclusion can be found to point in any direction the judges
favor.” Ibid. Moreover, the historical approach “intrudes
less upon the democratic process because the rights it
acknowledges are those established by a constitutional
history formed by democratic decisions; and the rights it
fails to acknowledge are left to be democratically adopted or
rejected by the people.” Id., at 805.
                              IV
  This Court’s Second Amendment jurisprudence has
carefully followed and reinforced the Court’s longstanding
approach to constitutional interpretation—relying on text,
pre-ratification and post-ratification history, and
precedent.
  In Heller, the Court began with the baseline point that
the Second Amendment textually guarantees an individual
right.    The Court then explained that the Second
Amendment right is, of course, “not a right to keep and
carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever
and for whatever purpose” and is subject to “important”
limitations. 554 U. S. 570, 626–627 (2008).
  Although Heller declined to “undertake an exhaustive
historical analysis,” it recognized a few categories of
traditional exceptions to the right. Id., at 626. For
example, Heller indicated that: (i) “prohibitions on carrying
concealed weapons were lawful”; (ii) the Second
Amendment attaches only to weapons “in common use”
because “that limitation is fairly supported by the historical
tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and
unusual weapons”; and (iii) “longstanding prohibitions on
the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or
laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            23

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing
conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of
arms” are presumptively constitutional. Id., at 626–627
(quotation marks omitted).
   In McDonald, the Court held that the Second
Amendment was incorporated against the States. In so
holding,     the    Court     reiterated    the     presumed
constitutionality of the “longstanding regulatory measures”
identified in Heller. 561 U. S. 742, 786 (2010) (plurality
opinion).
   Then, in Bruen, the Court repeated that the “Nation’s
historical tradition of firearm regulation” guides the
constitutional analysis of gun regulations and exceptions to
the right to bear arms. 597 U. S. 1, 17 (2022); see id., at 79–
81 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).
   This Court’s approach in those three recent Second
Amendment cases—and in the Court’s opinion today—is
entirely consistent with the Court’s longstanding reliance
on history and precedent to determine the meaning of vague
constitutional text. Heller rested on “constitutional text
and history,” ante, at 6 (quotation marks omitted), and laid
the foundation for McDonald and then Bruen.
   In today’s case, the Court carefully builds on Heller,
McDonald, and Bruen. The Court applies the historical test
that those precedents have set forth—namely, “whether the
new law is relevantly similar to laws that our tradition is
understood to permit.” Ante, at 7 (quotation marks
omitted). The Court examines “our historical tradition of
firearm regulation,” ante, at 6 (quotation marks omitted),
and correctly holds that America’s “tradition of firearm
regulation allows the Government to disarm individuals
who present a credible threat to the physical safety of
others,” ante, at 16. The law before us “fits neatly within
the tradition the surety and going armed laws represent.”
Ante, at 13–14.
   As the Court’s decision today notes, Second Amendment
24                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring

jurisprudence is still in the relatively early innings, unlike
the First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendments, for example.
That is because the Court did not have occasion to recognize
the Second Amendment’s individual right until recently.
See generally Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F. 3d 1244,
1269–1296 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).
Deciding constitutional cases in a still-developing area of
this Court’s jurisprudence can sometimes be difficult. But
that is not a permission slip for a judge to let constitutional
analysis morph into policy preferences under the guise of a
balancing test that churns out the judge’s own policy
beliefs.
                          *     *    *
  As exemplified by Heller, McDonald, Bruen, and the
Court’s opinion today, constitutional interpretation
properly takes account of text, pre-ratification and post-
ratification history, and precedent. Those are the tools of
the trade for an American judge interpreting the American
Constitution. Of course, difficult subsidiary questions can
arise about how to apply those tools, both generally and in
particular cases. And in some cases, text, history, and
precedent may point in somewhat different directions. In
law as in life, nothing is perfect. But in Second Amendment
cases as in other constitutional cases, text, history, and
precedent must remain paramount.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                         [June 21, 2024]

   JUSTICE BARRETT, concurring.
   Despite its unqualified text, the Second Amendment is
not absolute. It codified a pre-existing right, and pre-
existing limits on that right are part and parcel of it. Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 595, 627 (2008).
Those limits define the scope of “the right to bear arms” as
it was originally understood; to identify them, courts must
examine our “historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S.
1, 17, 19 (2022). That evidence marks where the right stops
and the State’s authority to regulate begins. A regulation
is constitutional only if the government affirmatively
proves that it is “consistent with the Second Amendment’s
text and historical understanding.” Id., at 26.
   Because the Court has taken an originalist approach to
the Second Amendment, it is worth pausing to identify the
basic premises of originalism. The theory is built on two
core principles: that the meaning of constitutional text is
fixed at the time of its ratification and that the “discovera-
ble historical meaning . . . has legal significance and is au-
thoritative in most circumstances.”          K. Whittington,
Originalism: A Critical Introduction, 82 Ford. L. Rev. 375,
378 (2013) (Whittington). Ratification is a democratic act
that renders constitutional text part of our fundamental
law, see Arts. V, VII, and that text “remains law until law-

dure, 135 Harv. L. Rev. 777, 782 (2022). So for an original-
ist, the history that matters most is the history surrounding
the ratification of the text; that backdrop illuminates the
meaning of the enacted law. History (or tradition) that long
postdates ratification does not serve that function. To be
sure, postenactment history can be an important tool. For
example, it can “reinforce our understanding of the Consti-
tution’s original meaning”; “liquidate ambiguous constitu-
tional provisions”; provide persuasive evidence of the origi-
nal meaning; and, if stare decisis applies, control the
outcome. See Vidal v. Elster, 602 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2024)
(BARRETT, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 13–14). But
generally speaking, the use of postenactment history re-
quires some justification other than originalism simpliciter.
   In Bruen, the Court took history beyond the founding era,
considering gun regulations that spanned the 19th century.
597 U. S., at 50–70. I expressed reservations about the
scope of that inquiry but concluded that the timing question
did not matter to Bruen’s holding. Id., at 81–83 (concurring
opinion). It bears emphasis, however, that my questions
were about the time period relevant to discerning the Sec-
ond Amendment’s original meaning—for instance, what is
the post-1791 cutoff for discerning how the Second Amend-
ment was originally understood? Id., at 82 (“How long after
ratification may subsequent practice illuminate original
public meaning?”). My doubts were not about whether “tra-
dition,” standing alone, is dispositive. Id., at 83 (“[T]oday’s
decision should not be understood to endorse freewheeling
reliance on historical practice from the mid-to-late 19th
century to establish the original meaning of the Bill of
Rights”). As I have explained elsewhere, evidence of “tradi-
tion” unmoored from original meaning is not binding law.

pulled from history may have little bearing on the meaning

of the text. Samia v. United States, 599 U. S. 635, 656–657
(2023) (BARRETT, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).
   “Original history”—i.e., the generally dispositive kind—
plays two roles in the Second Amendment context. It eluci-
dates how contemporaries understood the text—for exam-
ple, the meaning of the phrase “bear Arms.” See Heller, 554
U. S., at 582–592. It also plays the more complicated role
of determining the scope of the pre-existing right that the
people enshrined in our fundamental law.* In Rahimi’s
case, the Court uses history in this latter way. Call this
“original contours” history: It looks at historical gun regu-
lations to identify the contours of the right.
   Courts have struggled with this use of history in the wake
of Bruen. One difficulty is a level of generality problem:
Must the government produce a founding-era relative of the
challenged regulation—if not a twin, a cousin? Or do found-
ing-era gun regulations yield concrete principles that mark
the borders of the right?
   Many courts, including the Fifth Circuit, have under-
stood Bruen to require the former, narrower approach. But
Bruen emphasized that “analogical reasoning” is not a “reg-
ulatory straightjacket.” 597 U. S., at 30. To be consistent
with historical limits, a challenged regulation need not be

——————
   *To my mind, this use of history walks a fine line between original
meaning (which controls) and expectations about how the text would ap-
ply (which do not). See Whittington 383 (“Specific expectations about the
consequences of a legal rule are distinct from the meaning of the rule
itself ”). Contemporary government actors might have been “wrong
about the consequences of their own constitutional rule,” or they “might
not have fully and faithfully implemented the adopted constitutional rule
themselves.” Id., at 384. Thus, while early applications of a constitu-
tional rule can help illuminate its original scope, an interpreter must ex-
ercise care in considering them. Id., at 385–386. In the Second Amend-
ment context, particular gun regulations—even if from the ratification
era—do not themselves have the status of constitutional law.
4                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

an updated model of a historical counterpart. Besides, im-
posing a test that demands overly specific analogues has
serious problems. To name two: It forces 21st-century reg-
ulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us
“a law trapped in amber.” Ante, at 7. And it assumes that
founding-era legislatures maximally exercised their power
to regulate, thereby adopting a “use it or lose it” view of leg-
islative authority. Such assumptions are flawed, and
originalism does not require them.
   “Analogical reasoning” under Bruen demands a wider
lens: Historical regulations reveal a principle, not a mold.
See, e.g., 597 U. S., at 28–29 (explaining that the Amend-
ment does not apply only to the catalogue of arms that ex-
isted in the 18th century, but rather to all weapons satis-
fying the “general definition” of “bearable arms” (emphasis
added)); id., at 30–31 (discussing the “ ‘sensitive places’ ”
principle that limits the right to public carry); cf. Vidal, 602
U. S., at ___–___ (BARRETT, J., concurring in part) (slip op.,
at 7–9); Whittington 386 (“The insight to be gleaned is not
the authoritative status of the expected application, but the
apparent rule at play given that such an application is ex-
pected to follow from it”). To be sure, a court must be care-
ful not to read a principle at such a high level of generality
that it waters down the right. Pulling principle from prec-
edent, whether case law or history, is a standard feature of
legal reasoning, and reasonable minds sometimes disagree
about how broad or narrow the controlling principle should
be.
   Here, though, the Court settles on just the right level of
generality: “Since the founding, our Nation’s firearm laws
have included provisions preventing individuals who
threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.”
Ante, at 5; see also Kanter v. Barr, 919 F. 3d 437, 451, 464–
465 (CA7 2019) (Barrett, J., dissenting) (“History is con-
sistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legisla-

tures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from pos-
sessing guns”). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(i) fits well within that
principle; therefore, Rahimi’s facial challenge fails. Harder
level-of-generality problems can await another day.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                        [June 21, 2024]

   JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring.
   This case tests our Second Amendment jurisprudence as
shaped in particular by New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn.,
Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022). I disagree with the meth-
odology of that decision; I would have joined the dissent had
I been a Member of the Court at that time. See generally
id., at 83–133 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But Bruen is now
binding law. Today’s decision fairly applies that precedent,
so I join the opinion in full.
   I write separately because we now have two years’ worth
of post-Bruen cases under our belts, and the experiences of
courts applying its history-and-tradition test should bear
on our assessment of the workability of that legal standard.
This case highlights the apparent difficulty faced by judges
on the ground. Make no mistake: Today’s effort to clear up
“misunderst[andings],” ante, at 7, is a tacit admission that
lower courts are struggling. In my view, the blame may lie
with us, not with them.
                             I
  The Court today expounds on the history-and-tradition
inquiry that Bruen requires. Ante, at 7–8. We emphasize
that the Second Amendment is “not . . . a law trapped in
amber.” Ante, at 7. It “permits more than just those regu-
lations identical to ones that could be found in 1791”; in-
deed, “a challenged regulation [that] does not precisely
2                     UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                         JACKSON, J., concurring

match its historical precursors . . . ‘still may be analogous
enough to pass constitutional muster.’ ” Ibid. (quoting
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30). Gun regulations need only “com-
port with the principles underlying the Second Amend-
ment.” Ante, at 7–8. These clarifying efforts are welcome,
given the many questions Bruen left unanswered.
   When this Court adopts a new legal standard, as we did
in Bruen, we do not do so in a vacuum. The tests we estab-
lish bind lower court judges, who then apply those legal
standards to the cases before them. In my view, as this
Court thinks of, and speaks about, history’s relevance to the
interpretation of constitutional provisions, we should be
mindful that our common-law tradition of promoting clarity
and consistency in the application of our precedent also has
a lengthy pedigree. So when courts signal they are having
trouble with one of our standards, we should pay attention.
Cf. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,
469 U. S. 528, 538–539 (1985).
   The message that lower courts are sending now in Second
Amendment cases could not be clearer. They say there is
little method to Bruen’s madness.1 It isn’t just that Bruen’s

history-and-tradition test is burdensome (though that is no
small thing to courts with heavier caseloads and fewer re-
sources than we have). The more worrisome concern is that
lower courts appear to be diverging in both approach and
outcome as they struggle to conduct the inquiry Bruen re-
quires of them. Scholars report that lower courts applying
Bruen’s approach have been unable to produce “consistent,
principled results,” Brief for Second Amendment Law
Scholars as Amici Curiae 4, and, in fact, they “have come to
conflicting conclusions on virtually every consequential
Second Amendment issue to come before them,” id., at 4–5;
see also id., at 5–6 (collecting examples). Given this, it ap-
pears indisputable that, after Bruen, “confusion plagu[es]
the lower courts.” Id., at 6.

   This discord is striking when compared to the relative
harmony that had developed prior to Bruen. To be sure, our
decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570
(2008), which first recognized an individual right to keep
and bear arms for self-defense, see id., at 628, was disrup-
tive in its own way. After all, before Heller, “[t]he meaning
of the Second Amendment ha[d] been considered settled by
courts and legislatures for over two centuries,” and “judges
and legislators . . . properly believed . . . that the Second
Amendment did not reach possession of firearms for purely
private activities.” Id., at 676, n. 38 (Stevens, J., dissent-
ing). Nonetheless, after Heller, lower courts took up the
necessary work of reviewing burdens on this newly un-
earthed right. By the time this Court decided Bruen, every
court of appeals evaluating whether a firearm regulation
was consistent with the Second Amendment did so using a
two-step framework that incorporated means-end scrutiny.
See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 103 (Breyer, J., dissenting).
   Rejecting that “two-step approach” as having “one step
too many,” id., at 19, the Bruen majority subbed in another
two-step evaluation. Courts must, first, determine whether
“the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an individual’s
conduct.” Id., at 24. If it does, “[t]he government must then
justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent
with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Ibid.
   No one seems to question that “[h]istory has a role to play
in Second Amendment analysis.” Ante, at 4 (SOTOMAYOR,
J., concurring). But, per Bruen, courts evaluating a Second
Amendment challenge must consider history to the exclu-
sion of all else. This means legislators must locate and pro-
duce—and courts must sift through—troves of centuries-old
documentation looking for supportive historical evidence.2
——————
 2 It is not clear what qualifies policymakers or their lawyers (who do

                        JACKSON, J., concurring

    This very case provides a prime example of the pitfalls of
Bruen’s approach. Having been told that a key marker of a
constitutional gun regulation is “a well-established and rep-
resentative historical analogue,” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 30
(emphasis deleted), Rahimi argued below that “there is lit-
tle or no historical evidence suggesting disarmament for
those who committed domestic violence; and there is cer-
tainly no tradition of disarming people subject to a no-con-
tact order related to domestic violence.” Supp. Brief for Ap-
pellant in No. 21–11001 (CA5), p. 15 (emphasis deleted).
The Government then proffered what it maintained were
sufficient historical analogues to 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(8), in-
cluding surety and going armed laws. Supp. Brief for Ap-
pellee in No. 21–11001 (CA5), pp. 23, n. 2, 27–31. But the
Fifth Circuit concluded that the federal statute was uncon-
stitutional because the Government’s analogues were not
“ ‘relevantly similar.’ ” 61 F. 4th 443, 460–461 (2023).
    Neither the parties nor the Fifth Circuit had the benefit
of today’s decision, in which we hold that the Government
had in fact offered “ample evidence that the Second Amend-
ment permits the disarmament of individuals who pose a
credible threat to the physical safety of others.” Ante, at 8.
But even setting aside whether the historical examples the
Government found were sufficiently analogous, just can-
vassing the universe of historical records and gauging the
sufficiency of such evidence is an exceedingly difficult task.3

not ordinarily have the specialized education, knowledge, or training of
professional historians) to engage in this kind of assessment. And dutiful
legislators are not the only stakeholders who are far outside their depth:
Bruen also conscripts parties and judges into service as amateur histori-
ans, casting about for similar historical circumstances.
   3 The mad scramble for historical records that Bruen requires also sug-

gests that only those solutions that States implemented in the distant
past comport with the Constitution. That premise is questionable be-
cause, given the breadth of some of the Constitution’s provisions, it is
likely that the Founders understood that new solutions would be needed
over time, even for traditional problems, and that the principles they
6                    UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                        JACKSON, J., concurring

Consistent analyses and outcomes are likely to remain elu-
sive because whether Bruen’s test is satisfied in a particular
case seems to depend on the suitability of whatever histor-
ical sources the parties can manage to cobble together, as
well as the level of generality at which a court evaluates
those sources—neither of which we have as yet adequately
clarified.
  And the unresolved questions hardly end there. Who is
protected by the Second Amendment, from a historical per-
spective? To what conduct does the Second Amendment’s
plain text apply? To what historical era (or eras) should
courts look to divine a historical tradition of gun regulation?
How many analogues add up to a tradition? Must there be
evidence that those analogues were enforced or subject to
judicial scrutiny? How much support can nonstatutory
sources lend? I could go on—as others have. See, e.g.,
United States v. Daniels, 77 F. 4th 337, 358–360 (CA5 2023)
(Higginson, J., concurring) (providing a similarly nonex-
haustive list). But I won’t.
                               III
  Maybe time will resolve these and other key questions.
Maybe appellate courts, including ours, will find a way to
“[b]rin[g] discipline to the increasingly erratic and unprin-
cipled body of law that is emerging after Bruen.” J. Blocher
& E. Ruben, Originalism-by-Analogy and Second Amend-
ment Adjudication, 133 Yale L. J. 99, 174 (2023). Indeed,

v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 722 (2008) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (expressing
doubt that the Framers “intended future generations to ignore [modern-
day] matters”). It stifles both helpful innovation and democratic engage-
ment to read the Constitution to prevent advancement in this way. In
any event, what we see now is that Bruen’s history-and-tradition test is
not only limiting legislative solutions, it also appears to be creating
chaos.

areas,” and “it normally might be fair to venture the as-
sumption that case-by-case development [will] lead to a
workable standard.” Garcia, 469 U. S., at 540 (internal
quotation marks and alteration omitted). By underscoring
that gun regulations need only “comport with the principles
underlying the Second Amendment,” ante, at 7–8 (emphasis
added), today’s opinion inches that ball forward.
   But it is becoming increasingly obvious that there are
miles to go.4 Meanwhile, the Rule of Law suffers. That
ideal—key to our democracy—thrives on legal standards
that foster stability, facilitate consistency, and promote pre-
dictability. So far, Bruen’s history-focused test ticks none
of those boxes.
                         *    *    *
  I concur in today’s decision applying Bruen. But, in my
view, the Court should also be mindful of how its legal
standards are actually playing out in real life. We must
remember that legislatures, seeking to implement mean-
ingful reform for their constituents while simultaneously
respecting the Second Amendment, are hobbled without a
clear, workable test for assessing the constitutionality of
their proposals. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 54–57; cf. Bruen, 597
U. S., at 90–91 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And courts, which
are currently at sea when it comes to evaluating firearms
legislation, need a solid anchor for grounding their consti-
tutional pronouncements. The public, too, deserves clarity
when this Court interprets our Constitution.
——————
  4 Extremely pertinent inquiries relevant to consistent application of

Bruen’s standard await resolution. For example, in Bruen we acknowl-
edged the existence of “an ongoing scholarly debate on whether courts
should primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of an individual
right when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868 when defin-
ing its scope (as well as the scope of the right against the Federal Gov-
ernment).” 597 U. S., at 37. We saw no need to address the issue in
Bruen. Id., at 38. We similarly decline to resolve that dispute today.

 UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ZACKEY RAHIMI
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
                         [June 21, 2024]

  JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
  After New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen,
597 U. S. 1 (2022), this Court’s directive was clear: A fire-
arm regulation that falls within the Second Amendment’s
plain text is unconstitutional unless it is consistent with the
Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Not a
single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue, 18
U. S. C. §922(g)(8). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.
                                I
   Section 922(g)(8) makes it unlawful for an individual who
is subject to a civil restraining order to possess firearms or
ammunition. To trigger §922(g)(8)’s prohibition, a restrain-
ing order must bear three characteristics. First, the order
issues after a hearing where the accused “received
actual notice” and had “an opportunity to participate.”
§922(g)(8)(A). Second, the order restrains the accused from
engaging in threatening behavior against an intimate part-
ner or child. §922(g)(8)(B). Third, the order has either “a
finding that [the accused] represents a credible threat to
the physical safety of [an] intimate partner or child,” or an
“explici[t] prohibit[ion]” on “the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate part-
ner or child.” §922(g)(8)(C). If those three characteristics
are present, §922(g)(8) automatically bans the individual
2                  UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                       THOMAS, J., dissenting

subject to the order from possessing “any firearm or ammu-
nition.” §922(g).
   Just as important as §922(g)(8)’s express terms is what it
leaves unsaid. Section 922(g)(8) does not require a finding
that a person has ever committed a crime of domestic vio-
lence. It is not triggered by a criminal conviction or a per-
son’s criminal history, unlike other §922(g) subsections.
See §§922(g)(1), (9). And, §922(g)(8) does not distinguish
contested orders from joint orders—for example, when par-
ties voluntarily enter a no-contact agreement or when both
parties seek a restraining order.
   In addition, §922(g)(8) strips an individual of his ability
to possess firearms and ammunition without any due pro-
cess.1 Rather, the ban is an automatic, uncontestable con-
sequence of certain orders. See §922(g) (“It shall be unlaw-
ful for any [qualifying] person [to] possess in or affecting
commerce, any firearm or ammunition”). There is no hear-
ing or opportunity to be heard on the statute’s applicability,
and a court need not decide whether a person should be dis-
armed under §922(g)(8). The only process §922(g)(8) re-
quires is that provided (or not) for the underlying restrain-
ing order.
   Despite §922(g)(8)’s broad scope and lack of process, it
carries strong penalties. Any violation of §922(g)(8) is a fel-
ony punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment.
§924(a)(8); see also ante, at 3. And, a conviction for violat-
ing §922(g)(8) itself triggers a permanent, life-long prohibi-
tion on possessing firearms and ammunition.                See
§922(g)(1).
   In 2020, Zackey Rahimi and his ex-girlfriend, C. M., en-
tered into a qualifying civil restraining order. App. 1. C. M.
had requested the order and asserted that Rahimi as-
saulted her. See id., at 2. Because the order found that

Rahimi presented a credible threat and prohibited him from
using physical force against C. M., the order automatically
triggered §922(g)(8)’s firearms ban. A year later, officers
discovered firearms in Rahimi’s home. Rahimi pleaded
guilty to violating §922(g)(8).
   Before his guilty plea, Rahimi challenged his conviction
under the Second Amendment. He pointed to District of
Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570 (2008), which held that
the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep
and bear firearms. Section 922(g)(8), Rahimi argued, vio-
lates that right by penalizing firearms possession. The Dis-
trict Court rejected Rahimi’s claim. At that time, the
Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, applied a
form of means-end scrutiny to Second Amendment claims.
See, e.g., United States v. McGinnis, 956 F. 3d 747, 753–754
(2020). Applying Circuit precedent, the Fifth Circuit af-
firmed the District Court. 2022 WL 2070392 (2022).
   Roughly two weeks later, this Court issued its opinion in
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen. The
Court rejected the means-end-scrutiny approach and laid
out the appropriate framework for assessing whether a fire-
arm regulation is constitutional. Bruen, 597 U. S., at 17–
19. That framework requires the Government to prove that
the “regulation is part of the historical tradition that delim-
its the outer bounds of the right to keep and bear arms.”
Id., at 19. The Fifth Circuit withdrew its opinion to apply
the correct framework to Rahimi’s claim. Relying on Bruen,
the Fifth Circuit concluded that the Government failed to
present historical evidence that §922(g)(8) “fits within our
Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” 61 F.
4th 443, 460 (2023). The Fifth Circuit, accordingly, vacated
Rahimi’s conviction. We granted certiorari. 600 U. S. ___

                        II
  The Second Amendment provides that “[a] well regulated
4                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-
fringed.” As the Court recognizes, Bruen provides the
framework for analyzing whether a regulation such as
§922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment’s mandate.
“[W]hen the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an indi-
vidual’s conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects
that conduct.” 597 U. S., at 17. To overcome this presump-
tion, “the government must demonstrate that the regula-
tion is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of
firearm regulation.” Ibid. The presumption against re-
strictions on keeping and bearing firearms is a central fea-
ture of the Second Amendment. That Amendment does not
merely narrow the Government’s regulatory power. It is a
barrier, placing the right to keep and bear arms off limits
to the Government.
   When considering whether a modern regulation is con-
sistent with historical regulations and thus overcomes the
presumption against firearms restrictions, our precedents
“point toward at least two metrics [of comparison]: how and
why the regulations burden a law-abiding citizen’s right to
armed self-defense.” Id., at 29. A historical law must sat-
isfy both considerations to serve as a comparator. See ibid.
While a historical law need not be a “historical twin,” it
must be “well-established and representative” to serve as a
historical analogue. Id., at 30 (emphasis deleted).
   In some cases, “the inquiry [is] fairly straightforward.”
Id., at 26. For instance, “when a challenged regulation ad-
dresses a general societal problem that has persisted since
the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical
regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence
that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Sec-
ond Amendment. Likewise, if earlier generations ad-
dressed the societal problem, but did so through materially
different means, that also could be evidence that a modern
regulation is unconstitutional.” Id., at 26–27.

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

   The Court employed this “straightforward” analysis in
Heller and Bruen. Heller considered the District of Colum-
bia’s “flat ban on the possession of handguns in the home,”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 27, and Bruen considered New York’s
effective ban on carrying a firearm in public, see id., at 11–
13. The Court determined that the District of Columbia
and New York had “addressed a perceived societal prob-
lem—firearm violence in densely populated communities—
and [they] employed a regulation . . . that the Founders
themselves could have adopted to confront that problem.”
Id., at 27. Accordingly, the Court “consider[ed] ‘founding-
era historical precedent’ ” and looked for a comparable reg-
ulation. Ibid. (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 631). In both
cases, the Court found no such law and held the modern
regulations unconstitutional. Id., at 631; Bruen, 597 U. S.,
at 27.
   Under our precedent, then, we must resolve two ques-
tions to determine if §922(g)(8) violates the Second Amend-
ment: (1) Does §922(g)(8) target conduct protected by the
Second Amendment’s plain text; and (2) does the Govern-
ment establish that §922(g)(8) is consistent with the Na-
tion’s historical tradition of firearm regulation?
                                III
   Section 922(g)(8) violates the Second Amendment. First,
it targets conduct at the core of the Second Amendment—
possessing firearms. Second, the Government failed to pro-
duce any evidence that §922(g)(8) is consistent with the Na-
tion’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. To the con-
trary, the founding generation addressed the same societal
problem as §922(g)(8) through the “materially different
means” of surety laws. Id., at 26.
                            A
  It is undisputed that §922(g)(8) targets conduct encom-
passed by the Second Amendment’s plain text. After all,
6                     UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                          THOMAS, J., dissenting

the statute bans a person subject to a restraining order
from possessing or using virtually any firearm or ammuni-
tion. §922(g) (prohibiting covered individuals from “pos-
sess[ing]” or “receiv[ing] any firearm or ammunition which
has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce”). A covered individual cannot even possess a
firearm in his home for self-defense, “the central component
of the [Second Amendment] right itself.” Heller, 554 U. S.,
at 599 (emphasis deleted). There is no doubt that §922(g)(8)
is irreconcilable with the Second Amendment’s text. Id., at
628–629.
   It is also undisputed that the Second Amendment applies
to Rahimi. By its terms, the Second Amendment extends
to “ ‘the people,’ ” and that “term unambiguously refers to all
members of the political community, not an unspecified
subset.” Id., at 580. The Second Amendment thus recog-
nizes a right “guaranteed to ‘all Americans.’ ” Bruen, 597
U. S., at 70 (quoting Heller, 554 U. S., at 581). Since Rahimi
is a member of the political community, he falls within the
Second Amendment’s guarantee.
                              B
   The Government fails to carry its burden of proving that
§922(g)(8) is “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradi-
tion of firearm regulation.” 597 U. S., at 24. Despite can-
vassing laws before, during, and after our Nation’s found-
ing, the Government does not identify even a single
regulation with an analogous burden and justification.2
   The Government’s failure is unsurprising given that


——————
   2 I agree with the majority that we need not address the “ ‘ongoing

scholarly debate on whether courts should primarily rely on the prevail-
ing understanding of an individual right when the Fourteenth Amend-
ment was ratified in 1868 when defining its scope (as well as the scope
of the right against the Federal Government).’ ” Ante, at 8, n. 1 (quoting
New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1, 37 (2022)).

§922(g)(8) addresses a societal problem—the risk of inter-
personal violence—“that has persisted since the 18th cen-
tury,” yet was addressed “through [the] materially different
means” of surety laws. Id., at 26. Surety laws were, in a
nutshell, a fine on certain behavior. If a person threatened
someone in his community, he was given the choice to either
keep the peace or forfeit a sum of money. Surety laws thus
shared the same justification as §922(g)(8), but they im-
posed a far less onerous burden. The Government has not
shown that §922(g)(8)’s more severe approach is consistent
with our historical tradition of firearm regulation.
                              1
   The Government does not offer a single historical regula-
tion that is relevantly similar to §922(g)(8). As the Court
has explained, the “central considerations” when compar-
ing modern and historical regulations are whether the reg-
ulations “impose a comparable burden” that is “comparably
justified.” Id., at 29. The Government offers only two cate-
gories of evidence that are even within the ballpark of
§922(g)(8)’s burden and justification: English laws disarm-
ing persons “dangerous” to the peace of the kingdom, and
commentary discussing peaceable citizens bearing arms.
Neither category ultimately does the job.
                               i
   The Government points to various English laws from the
late 1600s and early 1700s to argue that there is a tradition
of restricting the rights of “dangerous” persons. For exam-
ple, the Militia Act of 1662 authorized local officials to dis-
arm individuals judged “dangerous to the Peace of the King-
dome.” 14 Car. 2 c. 3, §13. And, in the early 1700s, the
Crown authorized lords and justices of the peace to “cause
search to be made for arms in the possession of any persons
whom they judge dangerous, and seize such arms according
to law.” Calendar of State Papers Domestic: William III,
8                 UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

1700–1702, p. 234 (E. Bateson ed. 1937) (Calendar William
III).
  At first glance, these laws targeting “dangerous” persons
might appear relevant. After all, if the Second Amendment
right was historically understood to allow an official to dis-
arm anyone he deemed “dangerous,” it may follow that
modern Congresses can do the same. Yet, historical context
compels the opposite conclusion. The Second Amendment
stems from English resistance against “dangerous” person
laws.
  The sweeping disarmament authority wielded by English
officials during the 1600s, including the Militia Act of 1662,
prompted the English to enshrine an individual right to
keep and bear arms. “[T]he Stuart Kings Charles II and
James II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to
suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their op-
ponents.” Heller, 554 U. S., at 592. Englishmen, as a re-
sult, grew “to be extremely wary of concentrated military
forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.” Id.,
at 593. Following the Glorious Revolution, they “obtained
an assurance . . . in the Declaration of Right (which was
codified as the English Bill of Rights), that Protestants
would never be disarmed.” Ibid.
  The English Bill of Rights “has long been understood to
be the predecessor to our Second Amendment.” Ibid. In
fact, our Founders expanded on it and made the Second
Amendment even more protective of individual liberty. The
English Bill of Rights assured Protestants “Arms for their
Defence,” but only where “suitable to their Conditions and
as allowed by Law.” 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 2, (1688), in 6 Stat-
utes of the Realm 143. The Second Amendment, however,
contains no such qualifiers and protects the right of “the
people” generally. In short, laws targeting “dangerous” per-
sons led to the Second Amendment. It would be passing
strange to permit the Government to resurrect those self-
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)            9

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

same “dangerous” person laws to chip away at that Amend-
ment’s guarantee.
   Even on their own terms, laws targeting “dangerous” per-
sons cannot support §922(g)(8). Those laws were driven by
a justification distinct from that of §922(g)(8)—quashing
treason and rebellion. The Stuart Kings’ reign was marked
by religious and political conflict, which at that time were
often one and the same. The Parliament of the late 1600s
“re-established an intolerant episcopalian church” through
legislation targeting other sects, including “[a] fierce penal
code” to keep those other sects out of local government and
“to criminalize nonconformist worship.” Oxford Handbook
of the English Revolution 212 (M. Braddick ed. 2015) (Ox-
ford Handbook); see G. Clark, The Later Stuarts 1660–
1714, p. 22 (2d ed. 1955). These laws were driven in large
part by a desire to suppress rebellion. “Nonconformist min-
isters were thought to preach resistance to divinely or-
dained monarchs.” Oxford Handbook 212; see Calendar of
State Papers Domestic: Charles II, 1661–1662, p. 161 (M.
Green ed. 1861) (Calendar Charles II) (“[P]reachers go
about from county to county, and blow the flames of rebel-
lion”). Various nonconformist insurrections gave credibility
to these fears. See, e.g., Clark, The Later Stuarts, at 22;
Privy Council to Lord Newport (Mar. 4, 1661), in Transac-
tions of the Shropshire Archaeological and Natural History
Society, Pt. 2, 3d Ser., Vol. 4, p. 161 (1904).
   It is in this turbulent context that the English kings per-
mitted the disarming of “dangerous persons.” English lords
feared that nonconformists—i.e., people with “ ‘wicked and
Rebellious Principles’ ”—had “ ‘furnished themselves with
quantities of Arms, and Ammunition’ ” “ ‘to put in Execution
their Trayterus designs.’ ” Privy Council to Lord Newport
(Jan. 8, 1660), in id., at 156; see Calendar Charles II 541
(“The fanatics . . . are high and insolent, and threaten all
loyal people; they will soon be in arms”). In response, the
Crown took measures to root out suspected rebels, which
10                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

included “disarm[ing] all factious and seditious spirits.”
Id., at 538 (Nov. 1, 1662). For example, following “turbu-
lency and difficulties” arising from the Conventicles Act of
1670, which forbade religious nonconformists from assem-
bling, the lord mayor of London pressed that “a special war-
rant or commission [was] necessary” empowering commis-
sioners to “resist, fight, kill, and execute such rebels.”
Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1670, p. 236
(May 25, 1670) (M. Green ed. 1895) (emphasis deleted).
King Charles II ordered the lord mayor “to make strict
search in the city and precincts for dangerous and disaf-
fected persons, seize and secure them and their arms, and
detain them in custody till our further pleasure.” Id., at 237
(May 26, 1670).
   History repeated itself a few decades later. In 1701, King
William III declared that “great quantities of arms, and
other provisions of war” had been discovered in the hands
of “papists and other disaffected persons, who disown [the]
government,” and that such persons had begun to assemble
“in great numbers . . . in the cities of London and Westmin-
ster.” Calendar William III 233. He ordered the lord mayor
of London and the justices of the peace to “secur[e] the gov-
ernment” by disarming “any persons whom they judge[d]
dangerous,” including “any papist, or reputed papist.” Id.,
at 233–234 (emphasis deleted). Similar disarmaments tar-
geting “Papists and Non-jurors dangerous to the peace of
the kingdom” continued into the 1700s. Privy Council to
the Earl of Carlisle (July 30, 1714), in Historical Manu-
scripts Comm’n, Manuscripts of the Earl of Westmoreland
et al. 10th Report, Appx., Pt. 4, p. 343 (1885). As before,
disarmament was designed to stifle “wicked conspirac[ies],”
such as “raising a Rebellion in this Kingdom in favour of a
Popish Pretender.” Lord Lonsdale to Deputy Lieutenants
of Cumberland (May 20, 1722), in Historical Manuscripts
Commission, Manuscripts of the Earl of Carlisle, 15th Re-
port, Appx., Pt. 6, pp. 39–40 (1897).

  While the English were concerned about preventing in-
surrection and armed rebellion, §922(g)(8) is concerned
with preventing interpersonal violence. “Dangerous” per-
son laws thus offer the Government no support.
                              ii
  The Government also points to historical commentary re-
ferring to the right of “peaceable” citizens to carry arms. It
principally relies on commentary surrounding two failed
constitutional proposals.3 First, at the Massachusetts con-
vention, Samuel Adams unsuccessfully proposed that the
Bill of Rights deny Congress the power “to prevent the peo-
ple of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from
keeping their own arms.” 6 Documentary History of the
Ratification of the Constitution 1453 (J. Kaminski & G.
Saladino eds. 2000) (Documentary History). Second, Anti-
Federalists at the Pennsylvania convention unsuccessfully
proposed a Bill of Rights providing a “right to bear arms for
the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United
States, or for the purpose of killing game.” 2 id., at 597–
598, ¶7 (M. Jensen ed. 1976). The Anti-Federalists’ Bill of
Rights would also state that “no law shall be passed for dis-
arming the people or any of them, unless for crimes com-
mitted, or real danger of public injury from individuals.”
——————
   3 The Government also cites an amendment to the Massachusetts Con-

stitution providing that “the people have a right to keep and to bear Arms
for their Own and the Common defence.” The Popular Sources of Politi-
cal Authority: Documents on the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780,
p. 624 (O. Handlin & M. Handlin eds. 1966). The Government empha-
sizes that the amendment’s proponents believed they “Ought Never to be
deprived” of their arms, so long as they “Continue[d] honest and Lawfull
Subjects of Government.” Ibid. Even if the amendment contemplated
disarming dishonest and unlawful subjects, the Government makes no
effort to define those terms or explain why they necessarily include the
individuals covered by §922(g)(8). In any event, evidence concerning
what proponents behind an amendment to a single state constitution be-
lieved is too paltry to define the Second Amendment right. See Bruen,
597 U. S., at 46.

Id., at 598.
   These proposals carry little interpretative weight. To
begin with, it is “dubious to rely on [drafting] history to in-
terpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-
existing right.” Heller, 554 U. S., at 603. Moreover, the
States rejected the proposals. Samuel Adams withdrew his
own proposal after it “alarmed both Federalists and Anti-
federalists.” 6 Documentary History 1453 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted).4 The Pennsylvania Anti-Federalists’
proposal similarly failed to gain a majority of the state con-
vention. 2 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary
History 628 (1971).
   The Government never explains why or how language ex-
cluded from the Constitution could operate to limit the lan-
guage actually ratified. The more natural inference seems
to be the opposite—the unsuccessful proposals suggest that
the Second Amendment preserves a more expansive right.
After all, the Founders considered, and rejected, any tex-
tual limitations in favor of an unqualified directive: “[T]he
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be in-
fringed.”
   In addition to the proposals, the Government throws in a
hodgepodge of sources from the mid-to-late 1800s that use
the phrase “peaceable” in relation to firearms. Many of the
sources simply make passing reference to the notion. See,
e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 229
(1866) (proposed circular explaining freed slaves “have
shown by their peaceful and orderly conduct that they can
safely be trusted with fire-arms, and they need them to kill
game for subsistence”). Other sources are individual mus-
ings on firearms policy. See, e.g., The Sale of Pistols, N. Y.
Times, June 22, 1874 (advocating for “including pistols in

the law against carrying concealed weapons”). Sources that
do discuss disarmament generally describe nonpeaceable
citizens as those who threaten the public or government.
For example, the Government quotes a Union General’s or-
der that “all loyal and peaceable citizens in Missouri will be
permitted to bear arms.” Headquarters, Dept. of the Mis-
souri, General Orders, No. 86 (Aug. 25, 1863), in The War
of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies, Ser. 1, Vol. 22, Pt. 2, p. 475
(1888). Yet, the Government fails to mention that the Un-
ion General’s order addresses the “[l]arge numbers of men
. . . leaving the broken rebel armies . . . and returning to
Missouri . . . with the purpose of following a career of plun-
der and murder.” Id., at 474. The order provided that “all
those who voluntarily abandon[ed] the rebel cause” could
return to Missouri, but only if they “surrender[ed] them-
selves and their arms,” “[took] the oath of allegiance and
[gave] bond for their future good conduct.” Ibid. By con-
trast, “all loyal and peaceable citizens in Missouri w[ere]
permitted to bear arms” to “protect themselves from vio-
lence” and “aid the troops.” Id., at 475. Thus, the term
“loyal and peaceable” distinguished between the former re-
bels residing in Missouri who were disarmed to prevent re-
bellion and those citizens who would help fight against
them.
    The Government’s smorgasbord of commentary proves
little of relevance, and it certainly does not establish a “his-
torical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of the right
to keep and bear arms.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 19.
                            iii
  The Government’s remaining evidence is even further
afield. The Government points to an assortment of firearm
regulations, covering everything from storage practices to
treason and mental illness. They are all irrelevant for pur-
poses of §922(g)(8). Again, the “central considerations”
14                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

when comparing modern and historical regulations are
whether they “impose a comparable burden” that is “com-
parably justified.” Id., at 29 (emphasis deleted; internal
quotation marks omitted). The Government’s evidence
touches on one or none of these considerations.
   The Government’s reliance on firearm storage laws is a
helpful example. These laws penalized the improper stor-
age of firearms with forfeiture of those weapons. See, e.g.,
Act of Mar. 1, 1783, ch. 46, 1782 Mass. Acts pp. 119–120.
First, these storage laws did not impose a “comparable bur-
den” to that of §922(g)(8). Forfeiture still allows a person to
keep their other firearms or obtain additional ones. It is in
no way equivalent to §922(g)(8)’s complete prohibition on
owning or possessing any firearms.
   In fact, the Court already reached a similar conclusion in
Heller. The Court was tasked with comparing laws impos-
ing “a small fine and forfeiture of the weapon” with the Dis-
trict of Columbia’s ban on keeping functional handguns at
home for self-defense, which was punishable by a year in
prison. 554 U. S., at 633–634. We explained that the for-
feiture laws were “akin to modern penalties for minor pub-
lic-safety infractions like speeding or jaywalking.” Id., at
633. Such inconsequential punishment would not have
“prevented a person in the founding era from using a gun
to protect himself or his family.” Id., at 634. Accordingly,
we concluded that the burdens were not equivalent. See id.,
at 633–634. That analysis applies here in full force. If a
small fine and forfeiture is not equivalent to the District of
Columbia’s handgun ban, it certainly falls short of
§922(g)(8)’s ban on possessing any firearm.
   The Government resists the conclusion that forfeiture is
less burdensome than a possession ban, arguing that “[t]he
burdens imposed by bans on keeping, bearing, and obtain-
ing arms are all comparable.” Reply Brief 10. But, there is
surely a distinction between having no Second Amendment
rights and having some Second Amendment rights. If self-

defense is “the central component of the [Second Amend-
ment] right,” then common sense dictates that it matters
whether you can defend yourself with a firearm anywhere,
only at home, or nowhere. Heller, 554 U. S., at 599 (empha-
sis deleted). And, the Government’s suggestion ignores that
we have repeatedly drawn careful distinctions between var-
ious laws’ burdens. See, e.g., id., at 632 (explaining that
laws that “did not clearly prohibit loaded weapons . . . do
not remotely burden the right of self-defense as much as an
absolute ban on handguns”); see also Bruen, 597 U. S., at
48.
   Our careful parsing of regulatory burdens makes sense
given that the Second Amendment codifies a right with a
“historically fixed meaning.” Id., at 28. Accordingly, his-
tory is our reference point and anchor. If we stray too far
from it by eliding material differences between historical
and modern laws, we “risk endorsing outliers that our an-
cestors would never have accepted.” Id., at 30 (internal quo-
tation marks and alteration omitted).
   Second, the Government offers no “comparable justifica-
tion” between laws punishing firearm storage practices and
§922(g)(8). It posits that both laws punish persons whose
“conduct suggested that he would not use [firearms] respon-
sibly.” Brief for United States 24. The Government, how-
ever, does not even attempt to ground that justification in
historical evidence. See infra, at 28–29.
   The Government’s proposed justification is also far too
general. Nearly all firearm regulations can be cast as pre-
venting “irresponsible” or “unfit” persons from accessing
firearms. In addition, to argue that a law limiting access to
firearms is justified by the fact that the regulated groups
should not have access to firearms is a logical merry-go-
round. As the Court has made clear, such overly broad
judgments cannot suffice. In Bruen, New York claimed it
could effectively ban public carry because “the island of
Manhattan [is] a ‘sensitive place.’ ” 597 U. S., at 31. New
16                    UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                          THOMAS, J., dissenting

York defined a “sensitive place” as “all places where people
typically congregate and where law-enforcement and other
public-safety professionals are presumptively available.”
Id., at 30–31 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Court rejected that definition as “far too broa[d]” as it
“would in effect exempt cities from the Second Amendment
and would eviscerate the general right to publicly carry
arms for self-defense.” Id., at 31. Likewise, calling a mod-
ern and historical law comparably justified because they
both prevent unfit persons from accessing firearms would
render our comparable-justification inquiry toothless.5
  In sum, the Government has not identified any historical
regulation that is relevantly similar to §922(g)(8).
                             2
  This dearth of evidence is unsurprising because the
Founders responded to the societal problem of interper-
sonal violence through a less burdensome regime: surety
laws. Tracing back to early English history, surety laws
were a preventative mechanism for ensuring an individ-
ual’s future peaceable conduct. See D. Feldman, The King’s
Peace, the Royal Prerogative and Public Order, 47 Cam-
bridge L. J. 101, 101–102 (1988); M. Dalton, The Countrey
Justice 140–144 (1619). If someone received a surety de-
mand, he was required to go to a court or judicial officer
——————
   5 The Government’s other analogies suffer from the same flaws as the

firearm storage laws. It cites laws restricting firearm sales to and public
carry by various groups such as minors and intoxicated persons; laws
confiscating firearms from rioters; and laws disarming insurrectionists
and rebels. Brief for United States 22–27. These laws target different
groups of citizens, for different reasons, and through different, less oner-
ous burdens than §922(g)(8). See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 70 (explaining that
regulations “limit[ing] the intent for which one could carry arms, the
manner by which one carried arms, or the exceptional circumstances un-
der which one could not carry arms” do not justify “broadly prohibit[ing]
the public carry of commonly used firearms for personal defense”). None
establishes that the particular regulation at issue here would have been
within the bounds of the pre-existing Second Amendment right.

with one or more members of the community—i.e., sure-
ties—and comply with certain conditions. 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 249–250 (1769)
(Blackstone). Specifically, the person providing sureties
was required to “keep the peace: either generally . . . or . . .
with regard to the person who crave[d] the security” until a
set date. Id., at 250. If he kept the peace, the surety obli-
gation dissolved on that predetermined date. See ibid. If,
however, he breached the peace before that date, he and his
sureties would owe a set sum of money. See id., at 249–250.
Evidence suggests that sureties were readily available.
Even children, who “[we]re incapable of engaging them-
selves to answer any debt,” could still find “security by their
friends.” Id., at 251.
   There is little question that surety laws applied to the
threat of future interpersonal violence. “[W]herever any
private man [had] just cause to fear, that another w[ould]
burn his house, or do him a corporal injury, by killing, im-
prisoning, or beating him . . . he [could] demand surety of
the peace against such person.” Id., at 252; see also J.
Backus, The Justice of the Peace 25 (1816) (providing for
sureties when a person “stands in fear of his life, or of some
harm to be done to his person or his estate” (emphasis de-
leted)).
   Surety demands were also expressly available to prevent
domestic violence. Surety could be sought by “a wife
against her husband who threatens to kill her or beat her
outrageously, or, if she have notorious cause to fear he will
do either.” Id., at 24; see 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown
253 (6th ed. 1777) (“[I]t is certain, that a wife may demand
[a surety] against her husband threatening to beat her out-
rageously, and that a husband also may have it against his
wife”). The right to demand sureties in cases of potential
domestic violence was recognized not only by treatises, but
also the founding-era courts. Records from before and after
the Second Amendment’s ratification reflect that spouses
18                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                      THOMAS, J., dissenting

successfully demanded sureties when they feared future do-
mestic violence. See, e.g., Records of the Courts of Quarter
Sessions and Common Pleas of Bucks County, Pennsylva-
nia, 1684–1700, pp. 80–81 (1943) (detailing surety de-
manded upon allegations that a husband was “abusive to
[his wife] that she was afraid of her Life & of her Childrns
lifes”); see also Heyn’s Case, 2 Ves. & Bea. 182, 35 Eng. Rep.
288 (Ch. 1813) (1822) (granting wife’s request to order her
husband who committed “various acts of ill usage and
threats” to “find sufficient sureties”); Anonymous, 1
S. C. Eq. 113 (1785) (order requiring husband to “enter into
recognizance . . . with two sureties . . . for keeping the peace
towards the complainant (his wife)”).
                               3
   Although surety laws shared a common justification with
§922(g)(8), surety laws imposed a materially different bur-
den. Critically, a surety demand did not alter an individ-
ual’s right to keep and bear arms. After providing sureties,
a person kept possession of all his firearms; could purchase
additional firearms; and could carry firearms in public and
private. Even if he breached the peace, the only penalty
was that he and his sureties had to pay a sum of money. 4
Blackstone 250. To disarm him, the Government would
have to take some other action, such as imprisoning him for
a crime. See Feldman, 47 Cambridge L. J., at 101.
   By contrast, §922(g)(8) strips an individual of his Second
Amendment right. The statute’s breadth cannot be over-
stated. For one, §922(g) criminalizes nearly all conduct re-
lated to covered firearms and ammunition. Most funda-
mentally, possession is prohibited, except in the rarest of
circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. Rozier, 598 F. 3d
768, 771 (CA11 2010) (per curiam) (concluding that it was
“irrelevant” whether defendant “possessed the handgun for
purposes of self-defense (in his home)”); United States v.

Gant, 691 F. 2d 1159, 1162 (CA5 1982) (affirming convic-
tion of a business owner under §922(g) predecessor statute
for briefly possessing a firearm to ward off suspected rob-
bers). Courts of Appeals have understood “possession”
broadly, upholding convictions where a person “picked up
. . . three firearms for a few seconds to inspect” each, United
States v. Matthews, 520 F. 3d 806, 807 (CA7 2008), or “made
direct contact with the firearm by sitting on it,” United
States v. Johnson, 46 F. 4th 1183, 1189 (CA10 2022). They
have also construed §922(g) to bar “constructive possession”
of a firearm, including, for example, ammunition found in a
jointly occupied home. See, e.g., United States v. Stepp, 89
F. 4th 826, 832–835 (CA10 2023).
    Moreover, §922(g) captures virtually all commercially
available firearms and ammunition. It prohibits possessing
a firearm “in or affecting commerce” and “receiv[ing] any
firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or trans-
ported in interstate or foreign commerce.” §922(g). As
courts have interpreted that nexus, if a firearm or ammu-
nition has at any point crossed interstate lines, it is regu-
lated by §922(g). See Scarborough v. United States, 431
U. S. 563, 566–567 (1977) (holding §922(g)’s predecessor
statute covered firearm that “had previously traveled in in-
terstate commerce”); United States v. Lemons, 302 F. 3d
769, 772 (CA7 2002) (affirming conviction under §922(g)
for possessing firearm that “crossed into Wisconsin after
its manufacture at some indeterminate moment in time—
possibly years before it was discovered in [the defendant’s]
possession”).6 In fact, the statute goes even further by reg-
ulating not only ammunition but also all constituent parts

Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. See United States v.
Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring).

of ammunition—many of which are parts with no danger-
ous function on their own. See 18 U. S. C. §921(a)(17)(A).
   These sweeping prohibitions are criminally enforced. To
violate the statute is a felony, punishable by up to 15 years.
§924(a)(8). That felony conviction, in turn, triggers a per-
manent, life-long prohibition on exercising the Second
Amendment right. See §922(g)(1).
   The combination of the Government’s sweeping view of
the firearms and ammunition within its regulatory reach
and the broad prohibition on any conduct regarding covered
firearms and ammunition makes §922(g)(8)’s burden un-
mistakable: The statute revokes a citizen’s Second Amend-
ment right while the civil restraining order is in place. And,
that revocation is absolute. It makes no difference if the
covered individual agrees to a no-contact order, posts a
bond, or even moves across the country from his former do-
mestic partner—the bar on exercising the Second Amend-
ment right remains. See United States v. Wilkey, 2020 WL
4464668, *1 (D Mont., Aug. 4, 2020) (defendant agreed to
Florida protection order so he could “ ‘just walk away’ ” and
was prosecuted several years later for possessing firearms
in Montana).
   That combination of burdens places §922(g)(8) in an en-
tirely different stratum from surety laws. Surety laws pre-
serve the Second Amendment right, whereas §922(g)(8)
strips an individual of that right. While a breach of a surety
demand was punishable by a fine, §922(g)(8) is punishable
by a felony conviction, which in turn permanently revokes
an individual’s Second Amendment right. At base, it is dif-
ficult to imagine how surety laws can be considered rele-
vantly similar to a complete ban on firearm ownership, pos-
session, and use.
   This observation is nothing new; the Court has already
recognized that surety laws impose a lesser relative burden
on the Second Amendment right. In Bruen, the Court ex-

plained that surety laws merely “provide financial incen-
tives for responsible arms carrying.” 597 U. S., at 59. “[A]n
accused arms-bearer ‘could go on carrying without criminal
penalty’ so long as he ‘post[ed] money that would be for-
feited if he breached the peace or injured others.’ ” Id., at
56–57 (quoting Wrenn v. District of Columbia, 864 F. 3d
650, 661 (CADC 2017); alteration in original). As a result,
we held that surety laws were not analogous to New York’s
effective ban on public carry. 597 U. S., at 55. That conclu-
sion is damning for §922(g)(8), which burdens the Second
Amendment right even more with respect to covered indi-
viduals.
   Surety laws demonstrate that this case should have been
a “straightforward” inquiry. Id., at 27. The Government
failed to produce a single historical regulation that is rele-
vantly similar to §922(g)(8). Rather, §922(g)(8) addresses a
societal problem—the risk of interpersonal violence—“that
has persisted since the 18th century,” yet was addressed
“through [the] materially different means” of surety laws.
Id., at 26.
                              C
  The Court has two rejoinders, surety and affray laws.
Neither is a compelling historical analogue. As I have ex-
plained, surety laws did not impose a burden comparable to
§922(g)(8). And, affray laws had a dissimilar burden and
justification. The Court does not reckon with these vital
differences, asserting that the disagreement is whether
surety and affray laws must be an exact copy of §922(g)(8).
Ante, at 16. But, the historical evidence shows that those
laws are worlds—not degrees—apart from §922(g)(8). For
this reason, the Court’s argument requires combining as-
pects of surety and affray laws to justify §922(g)(8). This
piecemeal approach is not what the Second Amendment or
our precedents countenance.
22                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

                               1
  Despite the foregoing evidence, the Court insists that
surety laws in fact support §922(g)(8). To make its case, the
Court studiously avoids discussing the full extent of
§922(g)(8)’s burden as compared to surety laws. The most
the Court does is attack Bruen’s conclusion that surety laws
were less burdensome than a public carry ban. The Court
reasons that Bruen dealt with a “broad prohibitory regime”
while §922(g)(8) applies to only a subset of citizens. Ante,
at 15–16. Yet, that was only one way in which Bruen dis-
tinguished a public carry ban from surety laws’ burden.
True, Bruen noted that, unlike the public carry ban, surety
laws did not restrict the general citizenry. But, Bruen also
plainly held that surety laws did not “constitut[e] a ‘severe’
restraint on public carry, let alone a restriction tantamount
to a ban.” 597 U. S., at 59. In fact, that conclusion is re-
peated throughout the opinion. Id., at 55–59 (surety laws
“were not bans on public carry”; “surety laws did not pro-
hibit public carry”; surety laws “were not viewed as sub-
stantial restrictions on public carry”; and “surety statutes
did not directly restrict public carry”). Bruen’s conclusion
is inescapable and correct. Because surety laws are not
equivalent to an effective ban on public carry, they do not
impose a burden equivalent to a complete ban on carrying
and possessing firearms.
  Next, the Court relies on affray laws prohibiting “riding
or going armed, with dangerous or unusual weapons, [to]
terrif[y] the good people of the land.” 4 Blackstone 149 (em-
phasis deleted). These laws do not justify §922(g)(8) either.
As the Court concedes, why and how a historical regulation
burdened the right of armed self-defense are central consid-
erations. Ante, at 7. Affray laws are not a fit on either ba-
sis.
  First, affray laws had a distinct justification from
§922(g)(8) because they regulated only certain public con-
duct that injured the entire community. An affray was a

“common Nusanc[e],” 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, at
135, defined as “the fighting of two or more persons in some
public place, to the terror of his majesty’s subjects,” 4 Black-
stone 145. Even though an affray generally required “ac-
tual violence,” certain other conduct could suffice. 1 R.
Burn, The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 13 (2d
ed. 1756). As relevant here, an affray included arming one-
self “with dangerous and unusual weapons, in such a man-
ner as [to] naturally cause a terror to the people”—i.e., “go-
ing armed.” Ibid. Many postfounding going armed laws
had a self-defense exception: A person could “go armed with
a[n] . . . offensive and dangerous weapon” so long as he had
“reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury.” Mass.
Rev. Stat., ch. 134, §16 (1836); see also 1838 Terr. of Wis.
Stat. §16, p. 381; 1851 Terr. of Minn. Rev. Stat., ch. 112,
§18.
  Affrays were defined by their public nature and effect.
An affray could occur only in “some public place,” and cap-
tured only conduct affecting the broader public. 4 Black-
stone 145. To that end, going armed laws did not prohibit
carrying firearms at home or even public carry generally.
See Bruen, 597 U. S., at 47–50. Instead, they targeted only
public carry that was “accompanied with such circum-
stances as are apt to terrify the people.” 1 Burn, Justice of
the Peace, at 13; see Bruen, 597 U. S., at 50 (explaining that
going armed laws “prohibit bearing arms in a way that
spreads ‘fear’ or ‘terror’ among the people”).
  Affrays were intentionally distinguished from assaults
and private interpersonal violence on that same basis. See
Cash v. State, 2 Tenn. 198, 199 (1813) (“It is because the
violence is committed in a public place, and to the terror of
the people, that the crime is called an affray, instead of as-
sault and battery”); Nottingham v. State, 227 Md. App. 592,
602, 135 A. 3d 541, 547 (Md. 2016) (“[U]nlike assault and
battery,” affray is “not a crime against the person; rather,
affray is a crime against the public” (internal quotation
24                UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

marks omitted)). As treatises shortly before the founding
explain, “there may be an Assault which will not amount to
an Affray; as where it happens in a private Place, out of the
hearing or seeing of any, except the Parties concerned; in
which Case it cannot be said to be to the Terror of the Peo-
ple.” 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, at 134; see 1 Burn,
Justice of the Peace, at 13. Affrays thus did not cover the
very conduct §922(g)(8) seeks to prevent—interpersonal vi-
olence in the home.
   Second, affray laws did not impose a burden analogous to
§922(g)(8). They regulated a niche subset of Second
Amendment-protected activity. As explained, affray laws
prohibited only carrying certain weapons (“dangerous and
unusual”) in a particular manner (“terrifying the good peo-
ple of the land” without a need for self-defense) and in par-
ticular places (in public). Meanwhile, §922(g)(8) prevents a
covered person from carrying any firearm or ammunition,
in any manner, in any place, at any time, and for any rea-
son. Section 922(g)(8) thus bans all Second Amendment-
protected activity. Indeed, this Court has already con-
cluded that affray laws do not impose a burden “analogous
to the burden created by” an effective ban on public carry.
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 50. Surely, then, a law that imposes a
public and private ban on a covered individual cannot have
an analogous burden either.
   The Court counters that since affray laws “provided for
imprisonment,” they imposed a lesser burden than
§922(g)(8)’s disarmament. Ante, at 14. But, that argument
serves only to highlight another fundamental difference:
Affray laws were criminal statutes that penalized past be-
havior, whereas §922(g)(8) is triggered by a civil restraining
order that seeks to prevent future behavior. Accordingly,
an affray’s burden was vastly harder to impose. To im-
prison a person, a State had to prove that he committed the
crime of affray beyond a reasonable doubt. The Constitu-
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)           25

                     THOMAS, J., dissenting

tion provided a bevy of protections during that process—in-
cluding a right to a jury trial, counsel, and protections
against double jeopardy. See Amdts. 5, 6.
   The imposition of §922(g)(8)’s burden, however, has far
fewer hurdles to clear. There is no requirement that the
accused has actually committed a crime; instead, he need
only be prohibited from threatening or using force, or pose
a “credible threat” to an “intimate partner or child.”
§922(g)(8)(C). Section 922(g)(8) thus revokes a person’s
Second Amendment right based on the suspicion that he
may commit a crime in the future. In addition, the only
process required before that revocation is a hearing on the
underlying court order. §922(g)(8)(A). During that civil
hearing—which is not even about §922(g)(8)—a person has
fewer constitutional protections compared to a criminal
prosecution for affray. Gone are the Sixth Amendment’s
panoply of rights, including the rights to confront witnesses
and have assistance of counsel, as well as the Fifth Amend-
ment’s protection against double jeopardy. See Turner v.
Rogers, 564 U. S. 431, 441 (2011) (“[T]he Sixth Amendment
does not govern civil cases”); Hudson v. United States, 522
U. S. 93, 99 (1997) (“The [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects
only against the imposition of multiple criminal punish-
ments for the same offense”). Civil proceedings also do not
require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and some States
even set aside the rules of evidence, allowing parties to rely
on hearsay. See, e.g., Wash. Rule Evid. 1101(c)(4) (2024)
(providing the state rules of evidence “need not be applied”
to applications for protection orders (boldface and capitali-
zation deleted)); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §527.6(i) (West
Supp. 2024) (judge “shall receive any testimony that is rel-
evant” and issue order based on clear and convincing evi-
dence). The differences between criminal prosecutions and
civil hearings are numerous and consequential.
   Affray laws are wide of the mark. While the Second
Amendment does not demand a historical twin, it requires
26               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

something closer than affray laws, which expressly carve
out the very conduct §922(g)(8) was designed to prevent (in-
terpersonal violence in the home). Nor would I conclude
that affray laws—criminal laws regulating a specific type
of public carry—are analogous to §922(g)(8)’s use of a civil
proceeding to bar all Second Amendment-protected activ-
ity.
                              2
   The Court recognizes that surety and affray laws on their
own are not enough. So it takes pieces from each to stitch
together an analogue for §922(g)(8). Ante, at 13. Our prec-
edents foreclose that approach. The question before us is
whether a single historical law has both a comparable bur-
den and justification as §922(g)(8), not whether several
laws can be cobbled together to qualify. As Bruen ex-
plained, “determining whether a historical regulation is a
proper analogue for a distinctly modern firearm regulation
requires a determination of whether the two regulations”—
the historical and modern regulations—“are ‘relevantly
similar.’ ” 597 U. S., at 28–29. In doing so, a court must
consider whether that single historical regulation
“impose[s] a comparable burden on the right of armed self-
defense and whether that burden is comparably justified.”
Id., at 29 (emphasis added).
   The Court’s contrary approach of mixing and matching
historical laws—relying on one law’s burden and another
law’s justification—defeats the purpose of a historical in-
quiry altogether. Given that imprisonment (which involved
disarmament) existed at the founding, the Government can
always satisfy this newly minted comparable-burden re-
quirement. See ante, at 14–15. That means the Govern-
ment need only find a historical law with a comparable jus-
tification to validate modern disarmament regimes. As a
result, historical laws fining certain behavior could justify
completely disarming a person for the same behavior. That

is the exact sort of “regulatory blank check” that Bruen
warns against and the American people ratified the Second
Amendment to preclude. 597 U. S., at 30.
  Neither the Court nor the Government identifies a single
historical regulation with a comparable burden and justifi-
cation as §922(g)(8). Because there is none, I would con-
clude that the statute is inconsistent with the Second
Amendment.
                            IV
  The Government, for its part, tries to rewrite the Second
Amendment to salvage its case. It argues that the Second
Amendment allows Congress to disarm anyone who is not
“responsible” and “law-abiding.” Not a single Member of
the Court adopts the Government’s theory. Indeed, the
Court disposes of it in half a page—and for good reason.
Ante, at 17. The Government’s argument lacks any basis in
our precedents and would eviscerate the Second Amend-
ment altogether.
                              A
  The Government’s position is a bald attempt to refashion
this Court’s doctrine. At the outset of this case, the Govern-
ment contended that the Court has already held the Second
Amendment protects only “responsible, law-abiding” citi-
zens. Brief for United States 6, 11–12. The plain text of
the Second Amendment quashes this argument. The
Amendment recognizes “the right of the people to keep and
bear Arms.” (Emphasis added.) When the Constitution re-
fers to “the people,” the term “unambiguously refers to all
members of the political community.” Heller, 554 U. S., at
580; see also id., at 581 (beginning its analysis with the
strong “presumption that the Second Amendment right . . .
belongs to all Americans”). The Government’s claim that
the Court already held the Second Amendment protects
28                   UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                         THOMAS, J., dissenting

only “law-abiding, responsible citizens” is specious at best.7
See ante, at 17.
   At argument, the Government invented yet another posi-
tion. It explained that when it used the term “responsible”
in its briefs, it really meant “not dangerous.” See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 10–11. Thus, it posited that the Second Amendment
protects only law-abiding and non-dangerous citizens. No
matter how many adjectives the Government swaps out,
the fact remains that the Court has never adopted anything
akin to the Government’s test. In reality, the “law-abiding,
dangerous citizen” test is the Government’s own creation,
designed to justify every one of its existing regulations. It
has no doctrinal or constitutional mooring.
   The Government finally tries to cram its dangerousness
test into our precedents. It argues that §922(g)(8) and its
proffered historical laws have a shared justification of dis-
arming dangerous citizens. The Government, however,
does not draw that conclusion by examining the historical
justification for each law cited. Instead, the Government
simply looks—from a modern vantage point—at the mix of
laws and manufactures a possible connection between them
all. Yet, our task is to “assess whether modern firearms
regulations are consistent with the Second Amendment’s
text and historical understanding.” Bruen, 597 U. S., at 26
(emphasis added). To do so, we must look at the historical
law’s justification as articulated during the relevant time
period—not at modern post-hoc speculations. See, e.g., id.,
at 41–42, 48–49; Heller, 554 U. S., at 631–632. As I have
explained, a historically based study of the evidence reveals
that the Government’s position is untenable. Supra, at 7–
——————
   7 The only conceivably relevant language in our precedents is the pass-

ing reference in Heller to laws banning felons and others from possessing
firearms. See 554 U. S., at 626–627, and n. 26. That discussion is dicta.
As for Bruen, the Court used the phrase “ordinary, law-abiding citizens”
merely to describe those who were unable to publicly carry a firearm in
New York. See, e.g., 597 U. S., at 9, 15, 31–32, 71.

  As it does today, the Court should continue to rebuff the
Government’s attempts to rewrite the Second Amendment
and the Court’s precedents interpreting it.
                              B
  The Government’s “law-abiding, dangerous citizen” the-
ory is also antithetical to our constitutional structure. At
bottom, its test stems from the idea that the Second Amend-
ment points to general principles, not a historically
grounded right. And, it asserts that one of those general
principles is that Congress can disarm anyone it deems
“dangerous, irresponsible, or otherwise unfit to possess
arms.” Brief for United States 7. This approach is wrong
as a matter of constitutional interpretation, and it under-
mines the very purpose and function of the Second Amend-
ment.
  The Second Amendment recognizes a pre-existing right
and that right was “enshrined with the scope” it was “un-
derstood to have when the people adopted [the Amend-
ment].” Heller, 554 U. S., at 634–635. Only a subsequent
constitutional amendment can alter the Second Amend-
ment’s terms, “whether or not future legislatures or . . .
even future judges think [its original] scope [is] too broad.”
Id., at 635.
  Yet, the Government’s “law-abiding, dangerous citizen”
test—and indeed any similar, principle-based approach—
would hollow out the Second Amendment of any substance.
Congress could impose any firearm regulation so long as it
targets “unfit” persons. And, of course, Congress would also
dictate what “unfit” means and who qualifies. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 7, 51. The historical understanding of the Second
Amendment right would be irrelevant. In fact, the Govern-
ment posits that Congress could enact a law that the
Founders explicitly rejected. See id., at 18 (agreeing that
30               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

modern judgment would override “[f]ounding-[e]ra applica-
tions”). At base, whether a person could keep, bear, or even
possess firearms would be Congress’s policy choice under
the Government’s test.
   That would be the direct inverse of the Founders’ and rat-
ifying public’s intent. Instead of a substantive right guar-
anteed to every individual against Congress, we would have
a right controlled by Congress. “A constitutional guarantee
subject to future judges’ [or Congresses’] assessments of its
usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all.” Heller,
554 U. S., at 634. The Second Amendment is “the very
product of an interest balancing by the people.” Id., at 635.
It is this policy judgment—not that of modern and future
Congresses—“that demands our unqualified deference.”
Bruen, 597 U. S., at 26.
   The Government’s own evidence exemplifies the dangers
of approaches based on generalized principles. Before the
Court of Appeals, the Government pointed to colonial stat-
utes “disarming classes of people deemed to be threats, in-
cluding . . . slaves, and native Americans.” Supp. Brief for
United States in No. 21–11001 (CA5), p. 33. It argued that
since early legislatures disarmed groups considered to be
“threats,” a modern Congress has the same authority. Ibid.
The problem with such a view should be obvious. Far from
an exemplar of Congress’s authority, the discriminatory re-
gimes the Government relied upon are cautionary tales.
They warn that when majoritarian interests alone dictate
who is “dangerous,” and thus can be disarmed, disfavored
groups become easy prey. One of many such examples was
the treatment of freed blacks following the Civil War.
“[M]any of the over 180,000 African-Americans who served
in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confed-
eracy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them
and other blacks.” McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 771
(2010).      Some “States formally prohibited African-
Americans from possessing firearms.”           Ibid.    And,
                 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024)           31

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

“[t]hroughout the South, armed parties . . . forcibly took
firearms from newly freed slaves.” Id., at 772. “In one
town, the marshal took all arms from returned colored sol-
diers, and was very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever
an opportunity occurred.” Ibid. (alterations and internal
quotation marks omitted). A constitutional amendment
was ultimately “necessary to provide full protection for the
rights of blacks.” Id., at 775.
   The Government peddles a modern version of the govern-
mental authority that led to those historical evils. Its the-
ory would allow federal majoritarian interests to determine
who can and cannot exercise their constitutional rights.
While Congress cannot revive disarmament laws based on
race, one can easily imagine a world where political minor-
ities or those with disfavored cultural views are deemed the
next “dangers” to society. Thankfully, the Constitution pro-
hibits such laws. The “very enumeration of the [Second
Amendment] right takes out of the hands of government . . .
the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the
right is really worth insisting upon.” Heller, 544 U. S., at
634.
   The Court rightly rejects the Government’s approach by
concluding that any modern regulation must be justified by
specific historical regulations. See ante, at 10–15. But, the
Court should remain wary of any theory in the future that
would exchange the Second Amendment’s boundary line—
“the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed”—for vague (and dubious) principles with con-
tours defined by whoever happens to be in power.

  This case is not about whether States can disarm people
who threaten others. States have a ready mechanism for
disarming anyone who uses a firearm to threaten physical
violence: criminal prosecution. Most States, including
Texas, classify aggravated assault as a felony, punishable
32               UNITED STATES v. RAHIMI

                    THOMAS, J., dissenting

by up to 20 years’ imprisonment. See Tex. Penal Code Ann.
§§22.02(b), 12.33 (West 2019 and Supp. 2023). Assuming
C. M.’s allegations could be proved, Texas could have con-
victed and imprisoned Rahimi for every one of his alleged
acts. Thus, the question before us is not whether Rahimi
and others like him can be disarmed consistent with the
Second Amendment. Instead, the question is whether the
Government can strip the Second Amendment right of any-
one subject to a protective order—even if he has never been
accused or convicted of a crime. It cannot. The Court and
Government do not point to a single historical law revoking
a citizen’s Second Amendment right based on possible in-
terpersonal violence. The Government has not borne its
burden to prove that §922(g)(8) is consistent with the Sec-
ond Amendment’s text and historical understanding.
   The Framers and ratifying public understood “that the
right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preserva-
tion of liberty.” McDonald, 561 U. S., at 858 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Yet, in the
interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one sub-
set of society, today’s decision puts at risk the Second
Amendment rights of many more. I respectfully dissent.
