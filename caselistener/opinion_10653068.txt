   REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ET AL. v.
            FAITH GENSER, ET AL.
                  ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
                        [November 1, 2024]

   The application for stay presented to JUSTICE ALITO and
by him referred to the Court is denied.
   Statement of JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE
THOMAS and JUSTICE GORSUCH join, respecting the denial
of the application for a stay.
   This case concerns a recent decision of the Supreme Court
of Pennsylvania that adopted a controversial interpretation
of important provisions of the Pennsylvania Election Code.
Specifically, the court held that a provisional ballot must be
counted even if the voter previously submitted an invalid
mail-in ballot within the time required by law. The appli-
cants contend that this interpretation flouts the plain
meaning of the state election code, see 25 Pa. Cons. Stat.
§3050(a.4)(5)(ii) (2019), and that the interpretation is so far
afield that it also violates the Elections Clause and the Elec-
tors Clause of the Constitution of the United States. See
Art. I, §4, cl. 1; Art. II, §1, cl. 2; Moore v. Harper, 600 U. S.
1, 37 (2023). Seeking to prevent county election boards
from following that interpretation in next week’s election,
the applicants ask us to stay the State Supreme Court’s
judgment or at least to order the sequestration of ballots
that may be affected by that interpretation.
   The application of the State Supreme Court’s interpreta-
tion in the upcoming election is a matter of considerable im-
portance, but even if we agreed with the applicants’ federal

constitutional argument (a question on which I express no
view at this time), we could not prevent the consequences
they fear. The lower court’s judgment concerns just two
votes in the long-completed Pennsylvania primary. Staying
that judgment would not impose any binding obligation on
any of the Pennsylvania officials who are responsible for the
conduct of this year’s election. And because the only state
election officials who are parties in this case are the mem-
bers of the board of elections in one small county, we cannot
order other election boards to sequester affected ballots.
For these reasons, I agree with the order denying the appli-
cation.
