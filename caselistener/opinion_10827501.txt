CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT

  No. 23–825.      Argued November 12, 2024—Decided March 21, 2025
Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c) subjects a person who uses or carries a firearm
  during a “crime of violence” to a mandatory minimum sentence of five
  years. §§924(c)(1)(A)(i) and (D)(ii). Section 924(c)(3)(A) defines a
  “crime of violence” as a felony that “has as an element the use, at-
  tempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or
  property of another.” To determine whether an offense falls within
  §924(c)(3)(A)’s “elements clause,” the Court applies the categorical ap-
  proach, asking whether the offense in question always involves the
  use, attempted use, or threatened use of force. Here, Salvatore Delli-
  gatti was convicted of violating §924(c) after he recruited gang mem-
  bers to kill a suspected police informant and gave them a loaded re-
  volver to carry out the job.
     Before trial, Delligatti moved to dismiss his §924(c) charge on the
  ground that the charge lacked the required predicate crime of violence,
  but the District Court denied his motion. Delligatti’s indictment
  charged him with attempted murder under the violent-crimes-in-aid-
  of-racketeering (VICAR) statute, §1959(a)(5), which required proof
  that Delligatti had attempted second-degree murder under New York
  law. Delligatti argued that a VICAR offense predicated on New York
  second-degree murder is not a crime of violence under §924(c)’s ele-
  ments clause because homicide under New York law can be committed
  by omission, defined as the failure to perform a legal duty. The Second
  Circuit affirmed the District Court’s conclusion that New York at-
  tempted second-degree murder is a crime of violence for purposes of
  §924(c)(3)(A).
Held: The knowing or intentional causation of injury or death, whether
 by act or omission, necessarily involves the “use” of “physical force”
 against another person within the meaning of §924(c)(3)(A). Pp. 4–13.
2                   DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                                  Syllabus

       (a) It is impossible to deliberately cause physical harm without the
    use of physical force under §924(c). In United States v. Castleman, 572
    U. S. 157, this Court held that under §922(g)(9)—which prohibits any-
    one convicted of “a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” from own-
    ing a firearm—“the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury
    necessarily involves the use of physical force,” id., at 169. The Court’s
    reasoning proceeded in two steps. First, the Court found it “impossible
    to cause bodily injury without applying [the] force” needed to commit
    common-law battery. Id., at 170 (emphasis added). Second, the Court
    held that “the knowing or intentional application of force is a ‘use’ of
    force” in that sense. Ibid. (emphasis added).
       The logic of Castleman extends to §924(c). Although the parties stip-
    ulate that §922(g)(9) and §924(c) require different levels of force—
    battery-level force versus violent force—that difference is immaterial
    here. As the Court held in Stokeling v. United States, 586 U. S. 73, 80,
    violent force encompasses “the ‘force’ required for common-law rob-
    bery.” Although a mere touch is not sufficient force for common-law
    robbery, any force that actually causes injury or death is. Id., at 83.
    Further, common-law robbery, like battery, can be committed through
    the indirect use of force. Thus, the “knowing or intentional causation
    of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force” under
    §924(c) just as it does under §922(g)(9). Castleman, 572 U. S., at 169.
    Pp. 4–8.
       (b) Castleman’s logic forecloses Delligatti’s challenge. Because New
    York second-degree murder requires proof that the defendant inten-
    tionally caused the death of another person, it necessarily involves the
    use of physical force under §924(c).
       Delligatti contends that an offender can commit New York second-
    degree murder without being the actual cause of the victim’s death
    because the offender can do so through omission of a legal duty. But
    the test for “actual causality” is whether the victim’s death “would not
    have occurred in the absence of—that is, but for—the defendant’s con-
    duct.” Burrage v. United States, 571 U. S. 204, 211 (internal quotation
    marks omitted). When a child starves to death after the parents refuse
    to provide food, the parents’ conduct is no less a cause of death than if
    the parents had poisoned the child.
       Delligatti also argues that an offender who causes harm by omission
    does not make “use” of physical force “against the person . . . of an-
    other.” §924(c)(3)(A). But it is natural to say that a person makes
    “use” of something by deliberate inaction. A mother who purposely
    kills her child by declining to intervene when the child drinks bleach
    makes “use” of the bleach’s poisonous properties.
       Similarly, the phrase “against the person or property of another” in
    §924(c)(3)(A) does not exclude crimes of omission. That phrase at most
                     Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                      3

                                Syllabus

  requires that another person be “the conscious object” of the force. Bor-
  den v. United States, 593 U. S. 420, 430 (plurality opinion). Whenever
  an offender deliberately causes bodily harm by omission, another per-
  son is necessarily the conscious object of physical force.
    The ordinary meaning of the term “crime of violence” confirms that
  Congress meant for the elements clause to cover crimes of omission.
  Intentional murder is the prototypical “crime of violence,” and it has
  long been understood to incorporate liability for both act and omission.
  In 1986, when the elements clause was enacted, at least 33 States gen-
  erally defined criminally culpable acts to include omission of a legal
  duty, and leading criminal-law treatises equated act and omission. If
  the elements clause is to have a reasonable relationship to the term it
  defines, it must encompass cases where the offender makes use of
  physical force by deliberate inaction. Pp. 8–13.
83 F. 4th 113, affirmed.

       SALVATORE DELLIGATTI, PETITIONER v.
                UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
                                [March 21, 2025]

  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
  Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(3)(A) defines a “crime of violence”
to include a felony that involves the “use of physical force”
against another person. In the context of a closely related
statute, we have held that “the knowing or intentional cau-
sation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of phys-
ical force.” United States v. Castleman, 572 U. S. 157, 169
(2014). This case asks whether that principle extends to
§924(c)(3)(A) and, if so, whether the principle holds in cases
where an offender causes bodily injury by omission rather
than action. We answer both questions in the affirmative.
                               I
                               A
   Section 924(c) subjects any person who uses or carries a
firearm during or in relation to a “crime of violence” to a
mandatory minimum sentence of five years, to be served
consecutively with any other term of imprisonment.
§§924(c)(1)(A)(i) and (D)(ii). By the terms of the statute, a
federal felony qualifies as a predicate crime of violence if it
2               DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

falls within either of two provisions. Under the first provi-
sion, known as the elements clause, an offense qualifies if
it “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened
use of physical force against the person or property of an-
other.” §924(c)(3)(A). Under the second provision, known
as the residual clause, an offense qualifies if it, “by its na-
ture, involves a substantial risk that physical force against
the person or property of another may be used in the course
of committing the offense.” §924(c)(3)(B). In United States
v. Davis, 588 U. S. 445 (2019), this Court held that the re-
sidual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Id., at 470.
   This Court applies a “categorical approach” to determine
whether an offense falls within the elements clause. United
States v. Taylor, 596 U. S. 845, 850 (2022). Under that ap-
proach, we do not examine the defendant’s actual conduct.
Instead, we ask whether the offense in question “always”
involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force.
Ibid. If the offense can be committed without the use, at-
tempted use, or threatened use of force, it is not a crime of
violence under the elements clause.
                              B
  Salvatore Delligatti is an associate of the Genovese crime
family, one of the New York Mafia’s so-called Five Families.
In 2014, a local gas station owner hired Delligatti to kill
Joseph Bonelli, a “neighborhood bully” and suspected police
informant. United States v. Pastore, 83 F. 4th 113, 117
(CA2 2023). Delligatti recruited several members of a
street gang to carry out the job and provided them with a
car and a loaded revolver. The gang members drove to
Bonelli’s house while he was out, intending to shoot him
when he returned. They abandoned this plan, however, af-
ter seeing too many potential witnesses. At Delligatti’s urg-
ing, the gang members returned the following day to try
again. But, by this time, the police had discovered the plot
and arrested the gang members on their way to carry out

                     Opinion of the Court

the hit.
  The Government charged Delligatti with several of-
fenses, including one count of using or carrying a firearm
during or in relation to a “crime of violence” under §924(c).
The indictment charged as a predicate crime of violence
attempted murder under the violent-crimes-in-aid-of-
racketeering (VICAR) statute, 18 U. S. C. §1959(a)(5).
VICAR attempted murder requires proof that the defend-
ant committed an underlying state or federal offense that
constitutes attempted “murder.” Ibid. The Government al-
leged that Delligatti met this requirement by attempting
second-degree murder under New York law. A person com-
mits second-degree murder when, “[w]ith intent to cause
the death of another person, he causes the death of such
person or of a third person.” N. Y. Penal Law Ann.
§125.25(1) (West 2009).
  Before trial, Delligatti moved to dismiss his §924(c)
charge on the ground that the Government had not alleged
a valid predicate crime of violence. The District Court de-
nied the motion, holding that there “can be no serious argu-
ment” that VICAR attempted murder is not a crime of vio-
lence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a–41a. A jury convicted
Delligatti on all counts, and the District Court sentenced
him to 25 years’ imprisonment.
  On appeal to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, Delligatti argued that a VICAR offense predicated
on New York second-degree murder falls outside §924(c)’s
elements clause. Homicide under New York law can be
committed by act or omission, with the latter defined as a
failure to perform a legally imposed duty. N. Y. Penal Law
Ann. §§15.00(3), 15.10 (West 2009); People v. Steinberg, 79
N. Y. 2d 673, 680, 595 N. E. 2d 845, 847 (1992). Thus, for
example, a parent who intentionally causes his child’s
death by withholding food or medical care commits second-
degree murder under New York law. See People v. Best, 202
App. Div. 2d 1015, 1015–1016, 609 N. Y. S. 2d 478, 479
4                  DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                           Opinion of the Court

(1994). Delligatti argued that omission-based crimes like
these do not involve the “use of force.”
   While Delligatti’s appeal was pending, the Second Circuit
rejected his position in a different case. Relying on our de-
cision in Castleman, it held that the “ ‘knowing or inten-
tional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use
of physical force,’ ” even when the defendant causes harm
“by omission.” United States v. Scott, 990 F. 3d 94, 111, 114
(2021) (en banc) (quoting 572 U. S., at 169, and adding em-
phasis). Applying Scott, the Second Circuit held in Delli-
gatti’s case that New York attempted second-degree mur-
der—and, by extension, a VICAR offense predicated on it—
is a crime of violence because it necessarily involves at least
the attempted use of force. 83 F. 4th, at 121–122.1
   We granted certiorari to decide whether an individual
who knowingly or intentionally causes bodily injury or
death by failing to take action uses physical force within the
meaning of the elements clause. 602 U. S. ___ (2024).2
                              II
   The Second Circuit correctly held that causing bodily
harm by omission requires the use of force. As in Cas-
tleman, the “use” of “physical force” in §924(c) encompasses
the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury.
There is no exception to this principle when an offender
causes bodily injury by omission rather than affirmative
act. Delligatti’s §924(c) challenge therefore fails.
——————
  1 The Second Circuit assumed that the status of Delligatti’s VICAR of-

fense turns on whether the underlying state offense is a crime of violence.
83 F. 4th, at 119–120. However, at least one Court of Appeals has held
that a VICAR offense can be a crime of violence even if its underlying
predicate offense is not. United States v. Thomas, 87 F. 4th 267, 274–
275 (CA4 2023). We express no view on that issue.
  2 Before this Court, Delligatti does not dispute the Second Circuit’s

holding that New York attempted second-degree murder is a crime of
violence if the completed offense is a crime of violence. See Pet. for Cert.
28. We decide this case on that assumption.

                      Opinion of the Court

                            A
   Castleman establishes that under statutes like the one at
issue here it is impossible to deliberately cause physical
harm without the use of physical force. Although Cas-
tleman addressed a different statute, we conclude that its
holding extends to §924(c).
                                 1
   Section 922(g)(9), the statute at issue in Castleman, pro-
hibits anyone convicted of “a misdemeanor crime of domes-
tic violence” from owning a firearm. As under §924(c)’s ele-
ments clause, an offense qualifies under this provision if,
along with other criteria, it “has, as an element, the use . . .
of physical force.” §921(a)(33)(A). The question presented
in Castleman was whether an offense for “ ‘intentionally or
knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury’ ” met that description.
572 U. S., at 161. The District Court had held that it was
possible to commit the offense without the use of force, be-
cause the offense encompassed deceiving someone “ ‘into
drinking a poisoned beverage.’ ” Id., at 170. We disagreed.
Our reasoning proceeded in two steps.
   First, we found it “impossible to cause bodily injury with-
out applying force” in the sense relevant here. Ibid. (em-
phasis added). Section 922(g)(9), we held, encompasses the
kind and “degree of force that supports a common-law bat-
tery conviction.” Id., at 168. That “concept of ‘force’ ” in-
cludes causing bodily harm indirectly, such as “ ‘by admin-
istering a poison or by infecting with a disease, or even by
resort to some intangible substance,’ such as a laser beam.”
Id., at 170 (quoting 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law
§16.2(b) (2d ed. 2003)).
   Second, we held that “the knowing or intentional applica-
tion of force is a ‘use’ of force” under the provision in ques-
tion. 572 U. S., at 170 (emphasis added). A person uses
force in that sense when he makes force his “instrument,”
whether directly or indirectly. Id., at 170–171 (internal
6                 DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                          Opinion of the Court

quotation marks omitted). So, for example, when a person
“sprinkles poison in a victim’s drink,” he uses force by “em-
ploying poison knowingly as a device to cause physical
harm,” even though “the act of sprinkling” does not itself
involve force. Id., at 171 (alteration and internal quotation
marks omitted). Thus, whenever someone knowingly
causes physical harm, he uses force within the meaning of
§922(g)(9).
                              2
   The logic of Castleman extends to §924(c).            Both
§922(g)(9) and §924(c) cover offenses involving the “use” of
“physical force.” To be sure, these two provisions arguably
use the term “physical force” to require different levels of
force—battery-level force for §922(g)(9) and violent force for
§924(c).3 But, because both battery-level force and violent
force may be applied indirectly, that difference is immate-
rial here.
   In Castleman, Justice Scalia wrote an opinion concurring
in the judgment observing that deliberately causing injury
necessarily involves the use of both battery-level and vio-
lent force. The Castleman majority held that because of
§922(g)(9)’s particular focus on misdemeanor crimes of do-
mestic violence, the phrase “use of physical force” in that
statute requires only battery-level force, which can be sat-
isfied by “ ‘even the slightest offensive touching.’ ” Id., at
160–168. The majority thereby distinguished Johnson v.
United States, 559 U. S. 133 (2010), where this Court had
held that the same phrase in the elements clause of the
Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) required a higher

——————
  3 We have never addressed the meaning of “physical force” in §924(c)’s

elements clause. The parties, however, agree that the term refers to “vi-
olent force” as defined by Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 140
(2010), rather than the battery-level force at issue in Castleman. See
Brief for Petitioner 19; Brief for United States 10. We assume without
deciding that interpretation.

                           Opinion of the Court

showing of “violent force—that is, the force capable of caus-
ing physical pain or injury to another person.” Id., at 140;
see 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Justice Scalia disagreed,
concluding that §922(g)(9) requires violent force. Cas-
tleman, 572 U. S., at 175 (opinion concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). But, he made clear that this point
of disagreement did not affect the outcome of that case. He
explained that intentionally or knowingly causing bodily in-
jury “categorically involves the use of ‘force capable of caus-
ing physical pain or injury to another person.’ ” Ibid. (quot-
ing Johnson, 559 U. S., at 140). And, “for the reasons given
by the Court,” that is so even when the defendant “cause[s]
bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent means.”
572 U. S., at 175, n. 1 (opinion of Scalia, J.).4
   Justice Scalia’s view of violent force eventually garnered
a majority. In Stokeling v. United States, 586 U. S. 73
(2019), we held that violent force encompasses “the ‘force’
required for common-law robbery,” which is “the quintes-
sential ACCA-predicate crime.” Id., at 80. Common-law
robbery requires only the force needed to overcome the vic-
tim’s slightest physical resistance, even if it results in “min-
imal pain or injury.” Id., at 78, 83–84. Thus, although “ ‘the
merest touching’ ” is not violent force, any force that actu-
ally causes injury or death is. Id., at 83 (quoting Johnson,
559 U. S., at 139). We therefore concluded in Stokeling that
Justice Scalia’s “understanding of ‘physical force’ ” in Cas-
tleman was “consistent with our holding.” 586 U. S., at 85.
——————
   4 In the course of explaining why he thought that §922(g)(9) required

the use of violent force, Justice Scalia objected to the majority’s reliance
on advocacy groups that broadly defined “domestic violence” to include,
among other things, acts that “humiliate,” “isolate,” “frighten,” or
“blame” someone, and acts “of omission.” Castleman, 572 U. S., at 181
(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). In this context, the
phrase “acts of omission” plainly is not limited to causing injury or death
by deliberate inaction. Justice Scalia’s rejection of that definition thus
sheds no light on the question presented in this case. Contra, post, at 12
(GORSUCH, J., dissenting).
8               DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

   By pegging “physical force” to robbery, Stokeling makes
clear that even the indirect causation of bodily harm re-
quires the use of violent force. This principle was well es-
tablished when Congress enacted §924(c)’s elements clause
in 1986. 100 Stat. 456–457. As one contemporaneous trea-
tise put it, “[j]ust as battery may be committed by the ad-
ministration of poison, so the force used to obtain property
from a person against his will may be applied internally.”

(LaFave & Scott); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton’s Criminal Law
§479, p. 67 (14th ed. 1981) (Wharton).
   Delligatti resists extending Castleman’s logic to §924(c).
He argues there cannot be an “automatic connection” be-
tween injury and the violent force §924(c) requires because
even a small degree of force might injure an “eggshell” vic-
tim. Brief for Petitioner 37–38. But, as we held in Stokel-
ing, the minimal force needed to overcome the resistance of
“a feeble or weak-willed victim” still qualifies as sufficiently
“violent” to fall within the statute’s ambit. 586 U. S., at 83.
Delligatti also concedes that it is possible to use violent
force “indirectly,” Brief for Petitioner 7, as when a person
tricks another into eating food that has aged to the point of
becoming toxic, Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Thus, the “knowing or
intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves
the use of physical force” under §924(c) just as it does under
§922(g)(9). Castleman, 572 U. S., at 169.

                      Opinion of the Court

                                B
   Castleman’s logic forecloses Delligatti’s challenge. Delib-
erately causing injury necessarily involves the use of force
in the sense relevant here. Under New York law, second-
degree murder requires proof that the defendant intention-
ally “cause[d] the death of another person.” N. Y. Penal
Law Ann. §125.25(1). And, it should go without saying, in-
tentionally causing death counts as deliberately causing in-
jury. Thus, second-degree murder in New York—and, by
extension, Delligatti’s VICAR offense premised on it—is a
crime of violence under §924(c)’s elements clause.
   Delligatti disagrees. He insists that New York second-
degree murder falls outside Castleman’s rule because a per-
son can commit the offense through omission of a legal duty.
Steinberg, 79 N. Y. 2d, at 680, 595 N. E. 2d, at 847; supra,
at 3. In such cases, Delligatti contends, the law may deem
the offender the cause of the victim’s death through “legal
fiction,” but that fiction is not enough to make the person
the “actual cause.” Reply Brief 7. That is incorrect. We
have explained that the test for “actual causality” is
whether the victim’s death “would not have occurred in the
absence of—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” Bur-
rage v. United States, 571 U. S. 204, 211 (2014) (internal
quotation marks omitted). When a young child starves to
death after his parents refuse to give him food, that harm
would not have occurred but for the parents’ choice. Both
in the eyes of the law and as a practical matter, the parents’
conduct is no less a cause of the child’s death than if the
parents had poisoned him.
   Unable to escape Castleman’s reach, Delligatti argues in
the alternative that its rule is unsound as applied to omis-
sions. An offender who causes harm by omission, the theory
goes, does not make “use” of physical force “against the per-
son . . . of another.” §924(c)(3)(A). Again, we disagree.
   It is perfectly natural to say that a person makes “use” of
something by deliberate inaction. A car owner, for example,
10                 DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                          Opinion of the Court

can “use” the rain to wash his vehicle simply by leaving it
parked on the street. And, a fugitive can “use” the cover of
darkness to hide by lying still at night. In the same way, a
mother who purposely kills her child by declining to inter-
vene when the child finds bleach and starts drinking it
makes “use” of the bleach’s poisonous properties to accom-
plish her unlawful end. And, a husband who deliberately
abandons his wife to die in the cold “use[s] th[e] forces” of
“the elements” to cause her death. Territory v. Manton, 7
Mont. 162, 168, 14 P. 637, 638–639 (1887). Delligatti’s pro-
posed action-inaction distinction has no basis in ordinary
meaning.
  Similarly, we reject the argument that the phrase
“against another” excludes crimes of omission. At most,
that phrase requires that another person be “the conscious
object” of the force the offender uses. Borden v. United
States, 593 U. S. 420, 430 (2021) (plurality opinion). Put
differently, the language “against another” specifies the re-
quired object of the force (another person, rather than, say,
an animal), and possibly also the mens rea with which the
object must be targeted (knowingly or intentionally, rather
than negligently or recklessly). Id., at 430–434.5 Whenever
an offender deliberately causes bodily harm by omission, he
necessarily makes another person the conscious object of
physical force. In the bleach example, the mother’s refusal

——————
  5 In Borden, this Court split evenly on the meaning of “against another”

in ACCA’s elements clause. The four-Justice plurality held that the
phrase identifies the object of the force and limits the elements clause to
knowing or intentional wrongdoing. 593 U. S., at 430–434. The four-
Justice dissent held that the phrase only identifies the object. Id., at
454–461 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). The author of this opinion supplied
the fifth vote for the holding that the elements clause requires at least
knowing conduct, but did so for reasons unrelated to the meaning of
“against another.” Id., at 446 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). We
express no view on whether the phrase “against another” imports a mens
rea requirement, which is not necessary to resolve this case.

                      Opinion of the Court

to take away the bleach is not an accident, but rather a de-
liberate effort to make the child suffer the bleach’s poison-
ous effects. The mother thus uses force against her child.
It would be passing strange to say the mother used force to
cause the child’s death, but did not use force against any-
one.
   Context also confirms that crimes of omission fall within
the elements clause. The elements clause is a definition of
the term “crime of violence.” §924(c)(3). When choosing
among interpretations of a statutory definition, the “ordi-
nary meaning” of the “defined term” is an important con-
textual clue. Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844, 861
(2014). Thus, we prefer interpretations of the elements
clause that encompass prototypical “crimes of violence” over
those that do not. See Stokeling, 586 U. S., at 81–82;
Voisine v. United States, 579 U. S. 686, 696 (2016); Cas-
tleman, 572 U. S., at 167.
   Intentional murder is the prototypical “crime of violence,”
and it has long been understood to incorporate liability for
both act and omission. At the time of the elements clause’s
enactment, it was widely accepted that one could commit
murder by refusing to perform a legal duty, like feeding
one’s child. See, e.g., Lackey v. State, 246 Ga. 331, 331–332,
336, 271 S. E. 2d 478, 480–481, 483 (1980); State v. Nichol-
son, 585 P. 2d 60, 61–63 (Utah 1978) (per curiam); People v.
Burden, 72 Cal. App. 3d 603, 616–619, 140 Cal. Rptr. 282,
289–291 (1977); Biddle v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 14, 20–
21, 141 S. E. 2d 710, 714–715 (1965); State v. Shephard, 255
Iowa 1218, 1232–1235, 124 N. W. 2d 712, 720–722 (1963); 1
LaFave & Scott §3.3, at 282–283. As the Government notes,
this view had deep roots in the common law. See Cruzan v.
Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 297 (1990)
(Scalia, J., concurring) (collecting authorities); Common-
wealth v. Hall, 322 Mass. 523, 527–528, 78 N. E. 2d 644,
647 (1948) (same); 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown §8,
p. 79 (1716); Brief for United States 23–26.
12              DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

    Moreover, murder was not the only violent crime that
States recognized could arise from omission. Knowingly
causing nonlethal injury to one’s child by neglect, for exam-
ple, could amount to common-law battery. See, e.g., People
v. Bernard, 149 Ill. App. 3d 684, 693–695, 500 N. E. 2d
1074, 1079–1080 (1986); State v. Walden, 306 N. C. 466,
476, 293 S. E. 2d 780, 786–787 (1982); 1 LaFave & Scott
§3.3(e), at 294. In 1986, at least 33 States had statutes gen-
erally defining criminally culpable acts to include omission
of a legal duty. See Brief for United States 27–28, n. 3.
Leading criminal-law treatises similarly equated act and
omission. 1 LaFave & Scott §3.3, at 282–283; 1 Wharton
§25, at 116–120 (1978); see also ALI, Model Penal Code
§1.13(7), p. 209 (1985) (“acted” “includes, where relevant,
‘omitted to act’ ”).
    Thus, we cannot adopt Delligatti’s interpretation without
excluding traditional and widely accepted definitions of
murder and other prototypical violent crimes from the ele-
ments clause’s reach. If the elements clause is to have a
reasonable relationship to the term it defines, it must en-
compass cases where the offender makes use of physical
force by deliberate inaction. To the extent any doubt re-
mains that Congress meant for the elements clause to cover
crimes of omission, the ordinary meaning of “crime of vio-
lence” resolves it.
    Delligatti insists that his position—that murder is not a
crime of violence—is not as outlandish as it sounds. Con-
gress, he tells us, expected crimes like his to fall within the
now-defunct residual clause. See §924(c)(3)(B) (covering of-
fenses that involve “a substantial risk that physical force
. . . may be used”). But, to say that killing someone involves
a “risk” of force is a gross understatement in ordinary
speech, rendering the residual clause at best an awkward
fit. The elements clause is thus the natural home for mur-
der and other prototypical violent crimes, and the unrea-
sonableness of excluding such crimes from the elements

clause is an “additional reason to read the statute as we do.”
Castleman, 572 U. S., at 167.
                               C
   The dissent’s arguments fare no better than Delligatti’s.
The dissent asserts that the use of physical force requires
“a violent or extreme physical act” rather than “mere touch-
ing or pre-existing natural forces.” Post, at 4 (opinion of
GORSUCH, J.). In other words, disagreeing with Justice
Scalia, the dissent maintains that many ways of causing
bodily harm indirectly, such as deceiving the victim or slip-
ping poison into his drink, do not involve the use of violent
force. Post, at 4–5, n. 1; see Castleman, 572 U. S., at 175,
n. 1 (opinion of Scalia, J.). This view runs headlong into
Stokeling’s holding that violent force encompasses “the
‘force’ required for common-law robbery.” 586 U. S., at 80.
Common-law robbery is a crime that may be committed in-
directly, supra, at 8, such as by slipping a sedative into the
victim’s coffee, Dreas, 153 Cal. App. 3d, at 627, 200 Cal.
Rptr., at 589. Thus, no violent or extreme physical act is
needed to use force within the meaning of the elements
clause. Not even Delligatti disagrees with that basic prop-
osition. See supra, at 8.
   The dissent suggests that, in any event, criminal statutes
do not cover omissions absent express language to that ef-
fect. Post, at 6–7. No such clear-statement rule exists.
Many crimes “may be committed either by affirmative ac-
tion or by failure to act” even though they are not “specifi-
cally so defined.” 1 LaFave & Scott §3.3, at 282; see supra,
at 11–12. New York’s second-degree murder statute is a
prime example. It prohibits intentionally “caus[ing] the
death of another person” without explicitly mentioning
omissions. N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §125.25(1). But, because
one can cause death by omission, the statute covers omis-
sions. Supra, at 3. So too here, because one can make “use
of physical force” against another by omission,
14              DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

§924(c)(3)(A), the elements clause covers omissions.
   Nor do any of our precedents establish that, in the context
of the elements clause, it is impossible to “use” force by
omission. Contra, post, at 9–10. In Bailey v. United States,
516 U. S. 137 (1995), this Court explained that the word
“use” means “ ‘[t]o convert to one’s service,’ ‘to employ,’ ‘to
avail oneself of,’ and ‘to carry out a purpose or action by
means of.’ ” Id., at 145. Thus, the “mere possession of a
firearm” during a crime does not amount to a “use” of the
firearm under §924(c) if the wrongdoer does not employ the
firearm to accomplish his criminal end. Id., at 143; see also
Voisine, 579 U. S., at 692–693, and n. 3 (reiterating Bailey’s
interpretation of “use”); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9
(2004) (same). In contrast, a mother who lets her child
drink bleach because she wants him to die uses the force of
the bleach within the meaning of the elements clause be-
cause she accomplishes her purpose by means of the
bleach’s harmful effects. And, by targeting a particular in-
dividual, the mother has taken a “specific actio[n] against
[a] specific perso[n],” not merely “pose[d] an abstract risk to
community peace and order.” Taylor, 596 U. S., at 856. As
a matter of both text and precedent, deliberately causing
injury or death by omission is a use of physical force.
   Finally, the dissent takes issue with our reliance on the
ordinary meaning of “crime of violence,” branding it an im-
permissible “resort to unexpressed legislative intentions.”
Post, at 14. To the contrary, we engage in the standard task
of reading a statutory definition in light of the conventional
meaning of the term it defines. “Since on this side of the
looking-glass an entirely artificial definition is rare, the
meaning of the definition is almost always closely related
to the ordinary meaning of the word being defined.” A.
Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 228 (2012). Thus, when
the meaning of the elements clause “is not clear,” the ordi-
nary meaning of the term “crime of violence” is one of “the
most important” factors we can consider. Ibid.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
                         [March 21, 2025]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE JACKSON joins,
dissenting.
   Imagine a lifeguard perched on his chair at the beach who
spots a swimmer struggling against the waves. Instead of
leaping into action, the lifeguard chooses to settle back in
his chair, twirl his whistle, and watch the swimmer slip
away. The lifeguard may know that his inaction will cause
death. Perhaps the swimmer is the lifeguard’s enemy and
the lifeguard even wishes to see him die. Either way, the
lifeguard is a bad man. In many States, he may be guilty
of a serious crime for failing to fulfill his legal duty to help
the swimmer. But does the lifeguard’s offense also qualify
under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(3)(A) as a “crime of violence” in-
volving the “use . . . of physical force against the person . . .
of another”? The Court thinks so. I do not. Section
924(c)(3)(A) may reach many crimes, but it does not reach
crimes of omission.
                             I
                             A
  As I see it, the Court reaches the wrong destination be-
cause it takes a wrong turn at the start. Our cases are re-
plete with reminders that, when faced with a question of
statutory interpretation, the text is where we must begin
(and often end). Today, however, the Court whistles past
2               DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

the terms Congress gave us in §924(c)(3)(A). Instead, it
chooses to begin (and largely end) its analysis of this case
with an examination of precedent and assumptions about
congressional purposes. Ante, at 5–13. I will get to those
matters later. But first, let’s do what the Court does not
and look to the text.
    Section 924(c)(1) imposes a sentencing enhancement on
individuals who “us[e],” “carr[y],” or “posses[s]” firearms
“during and in relation to” a “crime of violence.” See ante,
at 1–2. Section 924(c)(3)(A) then proceeds to define the
phrase “crime of violence” as “an offense that is a felony and
. . . has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened
use of physical force against the person or property of an-
other.”
    Today, the Court reworks that definition at the govern-
ment’s request. Now, the Court says, a “crime of violence”
includes “the knowing or intentional causation of bodily in-
jury . . . by omission.” Ante, at 4. Under that approach, the
government admits, even our lifeguard, whose offense
stems from inaction, is guilty of a “crime of violence.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. 51. The only trouble is, nothing like the rule the
government proposes and the Court adopts appears any-
where in §924(c).
    To appreciate how unlikely the Court’s new rule is, just
walk through the statute’s key definitional terms, begin-
ning with the word “use.” When Congress adopted the cur-
rent version of §924(c) in 1984, the word “use” meant, as it
does today, “to employ,” “to convert to one’s service,” or “to
avail one’s self of.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1381 (def. 1) (5th
ed. 1979); see also Webster’s New Universal Unabridged
Dictionary 2012 (def. 1) (2d ed. 1983) (similar). As this
Court has long recognized, “[t]hese various definitions of
‘use’ imply action.” Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,
145 (1995); see also Voisine v. United States, 579 U. S. 686,
692–693, and n. 3 (2016) (collecting cases). And because
“use” has an “active meaning,” one does not “use” something
                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            3

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

through mere “inacti[on],” “inert[ia],” or “nonactiv[ity].”
Bailey, 516 U. S., at 148–149.
   What must a person actively employ to commit a crime of
violence?     The statute tells us:          “physical force.”
§924(c)(3)(A). That is, “[f]orce applied to the body; actual
violence.” Black’s Law Dictionary, at 1032. This Court ex-
plained as much in Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133
(2010). There, the Court addressed the meaning of the
phrase “physical force” in the definition of the term “violent
felony” in §924(e). “[P]hysical force,” the Court held, does
not reach “emotional” or “intellectual” force. Id., at 138.
Nor does it carry its “specialized meaning in the field of
physics: a cause of the acceleration of mass.” Id., at 138–
139. So letting a pre-existing force of nature run its course
does not suffice. Instead, an individual must employ
“[f]orce consisting in a physical act.” Id., at 139.
   The “physical act” must also be a violent one. Again, con-
sider Johnson. Because §924(e) uses the phrase “physical
force” to define what qualifies as a “violent felony,” the
Court in Johnson rejected the government’s effort to equate
the “physical act” required by the statute with the kind of
“mer[e] touching” sufficient to establish the common-law
crime of battery. Id., at 139. Resort to common-law battery
principles in this statutory scheme, the Court reasoned,
would produce “a comical misfit.” Id., at 145. Instead, the
Court ruled, the requisite “physical act” must be “violent,”
which is to say “extreme” and “severe.” Id., at 140. And if
that much follows when the phrase “physical force” is used
to define a “violent felony” in §924(e), surely the same must
hold true when the same phrase is used in the same section
of the U. S. Code to define a “felony” “crime of violence.”
§924(c); see Azar v. Allina Health Services, 587 U. S. 566,
574 (2019).
   Finally, the statute requires the use of force “against the
person or property of another.” Again addressing §924(e),
4                 DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                        GORSUCH, J., dissenting

a plurality of this Court has recognized that similar lan-
guage modifies the “volitional conduct (i.e., the use of force)”
discussed in the statute, and in doing so identifies the “con-
scious object” of a defendant’s “use of physical force.” Bor-
den v. United States, 593 U. S. 420, 431 (2021). All of which
suggests that the statute before us captures only active vi-
olent force when it is knowingly or intentionally applied
against the person or property of another. See id., at 431–
432.
   Putting these pieces together reveals the implausibility
of the Court’s new rule. To commit a “crime of violence,” an
individual must (1) actively (not just through inertia) em-
ploy (2) a violent or extreme physical act (not a mere touch-
ing or pre-existing natural forces) (3) knowingly or inten-
tionally to harm another person or his property. An
individual who, as the Court puts it, “causes bodily injury
by omission” does not begin to meet these criteria. Ante, at
4. Someone like our lifeguard may knowingly or intention-
ally cause another’s death by refusing to fulfill his legal
duty to act. Maliciously, he may choose to allow natural
forces to take their toll. But by remaining in his chair, he
does not actively employ even the merest touching, let alone
violent physical force. Of course, crimes of omission like our
lifeguard’s are serious ones that can invite serious punish-
ments under various state and federal laws.                 But
§924(c)(3)(A) was not written to reach every felony found in
our Nation’s many criminal codes. And the statute’s terms
simply cannot be stretched to cover crimes of “inact[ion],”
“inert[ia],” or “nonacti[vity].” Bailey, 516 U. S., at 149.1
——————
   1 Admittedly, trying to distinguish between acts and omissions can

sometime prove a tricky business. See, e.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of
Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. 449, 469 (2017) (GORSUCH, J., concur-
ring in part); 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law §3.2,
p. 273 (1986) (LaFave & Scott). But as I read this statute, that is a dis-
tinction Congress tasked us with drawing here. Nor is that the only line
this statute requires us to respect, for even when it comes to active

                              B
   Not only does the Court fail to grapple with the statutory
text, it breezes past the next best evidence of statutory
meaning: context. As it turns out, several pieces of contex-
tual evidence, all unmentioned by the Court, weigh against
the notion that a §924(c)(3)(A) “crime of violence” can in-
clude a crime of omission.
   First, consider how informed readers understood the
phrase in 1981. When Congress first considered defining
“crime of violence” to require the “use of physical force
against the person or property of another,” legislators rec-
ognized that those terms would not reach omissions.
S. Rep. No. 97–307, p. 591 (1981). A Senate report ex-
plained that the “operator of a dam [who] refuse[d] to open
the floodgates during a flood, thereby placing the residents
of an upstream area in jeopardy of their lives” would not
commit a “crime of violence” since “he did not . . . use phys-
ical force.” Ibid. Of course, “legislative history is not the
law” and should not be confused for it. Epic Systems Corp.
v. Lewis, 584 U. S. 497, 523 (2018). But the report supplies
at least some evidence that ordinary speakers at the time
of §924(c)(3)(A)’s enactment understood the phrase “use . . .
of physical force” to exclude crimes of omission. See A.
Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of
Legal Texts 388 (2012) (Scalia & Garner) (recognizing that
courts may use legislative history “for the purpose of estab-
lishing linguistic usage”).
   Second, analyzing “how particular combinations of words
are used in a vast database of English prose” can shed light
on how ordinary people understand statutory terms. See
——————
crimes §924(c)(3)(A) reaches only a subset of them. So imagine, for ex-
ample, our lifeguard, aware of deadly currents in the area, tricks a beach-
goer into the water with a promise about its safety. The lifeguard’s deceit
might be an act rather than an omission, but his crime does not involve
even a mere touching, let alone the use of violent physical force this stat-
ute demands.
6               DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 592 U. S. 395, 412 (2021) (ALITO,
J., concurring in judgment). Just such a database—the
Corpus of Contemporary American English—contains
“forty-seven non-specialist instances of ‘use of physical
force.’ ” United States v. Scott, 990 F. 3d 94, 129, n. 8 (CA2
2021) (en banc) (Menashi, J., concurring in part and concur-
ring in judgment). Of those references, “all refer to physical
contact; none plausibly refer to ‘deriv[ing] service from’ a
preexisting physical force.” Ibid. Thus the phrase “proto-
typically refers to assertive physical contact—‘punches,
kicks, slaps[,] and body slams.’ ” Id., at 129.
   Third, any other interpretation introduces redundancy
into the statutory scheme. Section 924(c)(3) details two sep-
arate ways in which an offense may qualify as a “crime of
violence.” The first, the focus of our attention, is found in
§924(c)(3)(A), or what is sometimes called the elements
clause. That provision addresses those felony offenses that
have “as an element the use . . . of physical force against the
person or property of another.” The second, found in
§924(c)(3)(B), or what is sometimes called the residual
clause, speaks to felony offenses that “by [their] nature, in-
volv[e] a substantial risk [of] physical force.” To the extent
§924(c) might address omission offenses, the residual
clause is their natural home. It requires no active employ-
ment of physical force, only a risk some such force might be
deployed. Expanding the elements clause to reach omission
offenses, as the Court does today, goes a long way toward
rendering the residual clause pointless. Perhaps the Court
considers that outcome a virtue, given that we have held
the residual clause unconstitutionally vague and thus un-
enforceable. United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. 445, 470
(2019). But conscripting one subsection to do the work no
longer performed by another makes a hash of the separate
and discrete provisions that Congress enacted.
   Finally, a look to the broader federal criminal code rein-
                      Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                       7

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

forces what the statutory text suggests. Congress has ex-
hibited no difficulty addressing omission crimes elsewhere,
mentioning them explicitly in dozens of provisions up and
down the U. S. Code. E.g., 18 U. S. C. §13(a) (“act or omis-
sion” is punishable); §542 (similar); §1166(b) (similar); 28
U. S. C. §1346(b)(1) (similar). The fact that Congress
“knows exactly” how to reach omission offenses “when it
wishes” to do so, yet declined to mention them in 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(3)(A), stands as one more piece of evidence yet that
the statute covers only offenses involving the active use of
force. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U. S. 685, 704
(2022).2
                              C
   Where does (or should) all this leave us? To determine
whether a state offense qualifies as a crime of violence un-
der the elements clause, a court must assess whether the
offense “has as an element the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force” against another.
§924(c)(3)(A). That assessment “does not require—in fact,
it precludes—an inquiry into how any particular defendant
may commit the crime.” United States v. Taylor, 596 U. S.
845, 850 (2022). Were it otherwise and a sentencing judge
could find facts about the defendant’s underlying conduct,
serious Sixth Amendment questions might follow. See Er-
linger v. United States, 602 U. S. 821, 833 (2024).
   Now apply the elements clause’s test to the New York
statute at issue before us. That law makes it a crime inten-
tionally “to cause the death of another.” N. Y. Penal Law
Ann. §125.25(1) (West 2009); see also ante, at 4, and n. 2.

  2 In recognizing that Congress’s choice of words in other statutes might

inform the best reading of this one, I hew to familiar interpretive princi-
ples. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S. 586, 595 (2010) (majority opin-
ion of THOMAS, J.) (same reasoning). I do not, as the Court charges, in-
vent a “clear-statement rule” for crimes of omission. Ante, at 13.
8               DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

Doubtless, New York’s offense can be (and usually is) com-
mitted by affirmative actions involving the use of violent
physical force. But, the parties agree, New York’s offense
can also be committed by someone, like our lifeguard, who
intentionally causes death by failing to fulfill a legal duty
requiring him to act. Brief for Petitioner 18; Brief for
United States 8. In cases like that, prosecutors can prevail
simply by showing that a defendant did nothing when he
had a legal duty to do something. And because a defendant
can be convicted of the crime without proof that he used,
attempted to use, or threatened to use physical force
against anyone or anything at all, New York’s offense can-
not qualify as a crime of violence under §924(c)(3)(A).
                               II
  The Court chafes at this conclusion. It emphasizes that
Mr. Delligatti committed no mere crime of omission but in-
stead plotted to use active force against his victim. Ante, at
2–4. On that much, there is no room for dispute. But nei-
ther is there room to dispute that §924(c)(3)(A) focuses on
the elements of New York’s offense, not the particulars of
Mr. Delligatti’s crime. Some have criticized this feature of
the elements clause, and their voices “could hardly be
louder.” United States v. Harris, 87 F. 4th 195, 212, and
n. 25 (CA3 2023) (Jordan, J., concurring in denial of rehear-
ing en banc) (collecting criticisms). But no amount of wish-
ful thinking can change the nature of the inquiry that
§924(c)(3)(A) demands. See Taylor, 596 U. S., at 850.
  Ultimately, the Court acknowledges as much. For New
York’s offense to qualify as a “crime of violence,” the Court
concedes, it must find some way to explain how committing
that offense by omission requires the government to prove,
as an element, the “use . . . of physical force.” Ante, at 4, 8.
To get there, the Court appeals to precedent, ante, at 5–10,
and implicit congressional purposes, ante, at 10–11. But,
unsurprisingly, our precedents do not require us to ignore
                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)              9

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

the statute’s terms. And no amount of conjecture about im-
plicit congressional purposes can substitute for statutory
text.
   Start with the Court’s argument from precedent. The
Court asks us to believe that its hands are tied by United
States v. Castleman, 572 U. S. 157 (2014), and Stokeling v.
United States, 586 U. S. 73 (2019). Those two cases, the
Court insists, require us to conclude that knowingly or in-
tentionally causing bodily injury by omission always “re-
quires the use of force.” Ante, at 4. So, as the Court tells it,
even if the statute’s terms might suggest a different result,
respect for stare decisis compels the conclusion that New
York’s statute satisfies the elements clause. Ibid.
   Notice, though, what’s missing from the Court’s account
of precedent. While training its attention on Castleman
and Stokeling, the Court neglects so many other relevant
cases, relegating them to little more than an afterthought.
Ante, at 13–14. Where is Bailey, and its holding that the
term “use” in §924(c)(1) carries an “active meaning,” imply-
ing “action and implementation,” not mere “inacti[on],” “in-
ert[ia],” or “nonactivit[y]”? 516 U. S., at 145–149. Where is
our precedent holding that the same word in the same law
normally carries the same meaning—indicating that the
term “use” in §924(c)(3)(A) should be read the same way?
See Azar, 587 U. S., at 574. Where are our decisions in
Leocal and Voisine, interpreting “use” in other analogous
contexts to mean “active employment,” Leocal v. Ashcroft,
543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004), or “volitional conduct,” Voisine, 579
U. S., at 693? Where is Johnson’s conclusion that the term
“physical force” in §924(e) excludes “its specialized meaning
in . . . physics,” requires more than “the merest touching,”
and cannot be equated with the common law of battery?
559 U. S., at 138–139. And where is Taylor’s admission
that a “crime of violence” under §924(c) “[p]lainly . . . re-
quires the government to prove that the defendant took spe-
cific actions against specific persons or their property”? 596
10              DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

U. S., at 856. Viewing our precedents as a whole leaves lit-
tle question about how this case should come out. But, ra-
ther than engage with so many inconvenient cases, the
Court largely ignores them.
   Even examined in isolation, the two decisions the Court
plucks out of the stack cannot begin to do the work the
Court seeks to impress upon them. Take Castleman first.
It involved §922(g), which prohibits anyone convicted of a
“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” from owning a
firearm. By statute, Congress has defined the phrase “mis-
demeanor crime[s] of domestic violence” to reach certain of-
fenses that have “as an element, the . . . use of physical
force.” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The question for the Court was
whether a state domestic-assault statute making it a crime
to “intentionally or knowingly caus[e] bodily injury” satis-
fied that definition. 572 U. S., at 161. The Court held it
did. Because §922(g)(9) focuses on misdemeanor crimes of
violence, the Court reasoned, it requires no more “physical
force” than that required to establish a battery at common
law—so “even the slightest offensive touching” will do.
Ante, at 6 (quoting Castleman, 572 U. S., at 160–168). And,
the Court held, the state offense at issue met that standard
because it required proof of “force in the common-law
sense.” Id., at 170.
   Nothing in Castleman compels the conclusion that omis-
sion crimes involve “the use, attempted use, or threatened
use of physical force” sufficient to implicate §924(c)(3)(A).
Cf. ante, at 5. In fact, Castleman did not even discuss
crimes of omission. And when the Court spoke of what it
means to “use physical force,” the Court spoke in active
terms, stressing that the “knowing or intentional applica-
tion of force is a ‘use’ of force.” 572 U. S., at 170 (emphasis
added). To be sure, the Court observed that a defendant
may use physical force “indirectly, rather than directly.”
Id., at 170–171. So, the Court explained, when a defendant
“pull[s] the trigger on a gun,” the defendant uses physical
                   Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)             11

                      GORSUCH, J., dissenting

force even though the “bullet, not the trigger, . . . strikes the
victim.” Ibid. But from that, it does not follow that a de-
fendant “uses physical force” when he does nothing. Cf.
ante, at 4–6. Someone like our lifeguard stands worlds
away from a shooter who indirectly “uses” a firearm’s explo-
sive force when he pulls the trigger.
   To the extent Castleman has anything to say about our
case, it does more to hurt than to help the Court’s cause. To
reach its holding that common-law battery informs the de-
gree of physical force required by §922(g)(9), Castleman had
to distinguish Johnson, where the Court held that the de-
gree of force associated with common-law battery does not
qualify as the kind of “physical force” necessary to satisfy
§924(e). 559 U. S., at 140; see Part I–A, supra. To distin-
guish Johnson, Castleman stressed that §922(g)(9) ad-
dresses “misdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence,” while
§924(e) focuses on “violent felon[ies].” 572 U. S., at 163–164
(emphasis added). That difference, the Court reasoned, in-
dicates the two statutes demand different degrees of force.
Id., at 164. Here, of course, we face a statute like §924(e),
one addressing felony crimes of violence, not mere misde-
meanors. And if, as Johnson held and Castleman recog-
nized, a mere touching is insufficient to satisfy §924(e)’s
“physical force” requirement, it is hard to imagine how com-
plete inaction might fit the bill under §924(c)(3)(A).
   With nothing in the Castleman majority opinion to help
it, the Court eventually turns to Justice Scalia’s solo con-
currence. Ante, at 6–7. There, he rejected the majority’s
suggestion that a slight touching qualifies as the “use of
physical force” even under §922(g). 572 U. S., at 173–175
(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
The common-law battery standard, he said, plays no role in
a statute that does not reference it. Id., at 176. Instead,
the author of Johnson explained that he read the phrase
“physical force” in both §922(g) and §924(e) to mean what
Johnson said it means: “violent force—that is, force capable
12             DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

of causing physical pain or injury.” 572 U. S., at 174 (quot-
ing Johnson, 559 U. S., at 140) (emphasis deleted). Even
so, Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment because the
state statute at issue in Castleman required proof that the
defendant “cause[d] bodily injury,” and, in his view, “it is
impossible to cause bodily injury” without employing the
kind of violent force Johnson discussed. 572 U. S., at 174.
   That syllogism is of no use to the Court here. Justice
Scalia may have claimed that a defendant whose actions
cause bodily injury necessarily uses violent physical force.
Ibid. But he did not claim that a defendant whose failure
to act causes bodily injury also necessarily uses violent
physical force. Quite the opposite. “[N]onphysical conduct”
like “acts of omission,” Justice Scalia said, cannot “possibly
be relevant to the meaning of a statute requiring ‘physical
force.’ ” Id., at 181 (emphasis deleted; some internal quota-
tion marks omitted). By rejecting the notion that omissions
resulting in bodily injury can give rise to liability under
statutes like the one before us, Justice Scalia stuck to his
view in Johnson that the phrase “use . . . of physical force”
captures only “ ‘a category of violent, active crimes.’ ” 559
U. S., at 140 (quoting Leocal, 543 U. S., at 11; emphasis
added). And it is a view directly at odds with the Court’s
decision today.
   Finding Castleman a dry hole, the Court prospects
Stokeling. Ante, at 7–8. But the Court does so only briefly,
and understandably so. Stokeling held that the phrase
“physical force” in §924(e) “includes the amount of force nec-
essary to overcome a [robbery] victim’s resistance.” 586
U. S., at 87. That amount of force, the Court explained,
does not encompass “the merest touching,” id., at 83, or
simply “snatching of property from another,” id., at 86, but
requires more “physical contact,” id., at 83. How any of that
helps the Court today mystifies. Our case does not present
a question about robbery or purse snatching, and nothing
in Stokeling begins to address the question whether a crime
                      Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                    13

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

of omission entails the “use . . . of physical force.” More
than that, Stokeling’s statements about the degree of force
required to satisfy §924(e) indicate that something beyond
mere inaction is required.3
                               III
   Unable to ground its decision in precedent, the Court re-
treats, at the tail end of its opinion, to an argument about
statutory purpose. Ante, at 10–11. The argument runs this
way. The Court observes that some notable crimes at com-
mon law, including murder and battery, required prosecu-
tors to prove only that the defendant, with a particular
mens rea, caused a particular result (e.g., death or bodily
injury), whether by affirmative action or by failing to fulfill
a legal duty that required him to act. Offenses like that are
sometimes called “cause and result” crimes. See 1 LaFave


——————
   3 Later in its opinion, the Court returns to Stokeling and suggests it

means that any force actively but “indirectly” applied to another—such
as robbing an individual after “slipping a sedative into [his] coffee”—
qualifies as the use of violent physical force if it results in some bodily
injury. Ante, at 13. But Stokeling said nothing of the kind. It did not
discuss “indirect” applications of force, sedatives—or coffee. Instead,
that decision addressed a state robbery statute demanding proof, as an
element, that the offender’s “physical force” overcame “resistance by the
victim.” 586 U. S., at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted). And that
offense, the Court held, falls within the “category of violent, active
crimes” embraced by §924(e). Id., at 83. Nor could Stokeling have sen-
sibly said what the Court now supposes. The truth is that some acts
involve the use of violent physical force and others do not, regardless
whether those acts directly or indirectly cause bodily injury. So, as we
have seen, pulling the trigger of a gun involves the indirect application
of violent physical force. Supra, at 11. But that hardly means pulling
the trigger of a nerf gun, using the force of the coiled spring to expel a
projectile, does too—even if striking someone with it causes a bodily in-
jury. In any event, whatever Stokeling did (or did not) say about crimes
involving the active but indirect application of force, it said precisely
nothing about crimes of omission where the defendant does nothing at
all.
14             DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

& Scott §3.3, at 283, 293–294. Many contemporary stat-
utes, the New York murder statute before us among them,
follow this common-law pattern. And, on the Court’s the-
ory, if §924(c)(3)(A) failed to reach significant cause-and-
result crimes like murder and battery simply because they
can be committed by omission as well as by act, the statute
would not adequately serve its purpose of addressing
“crimes of violence.” Ante, at 11. I am not blind to the ap-
peal of the argument, but I find it unpersuasive for a couple
reasons.
                              A
   For one thing, there can be little doubt about what the
argument is: a resort to unexpressed legislative intentions.
Congress, the Court insists, could not possibly have used
the phrase “crime of violence” in §924(c)(3)(A) without in-
tending to capture “prototypical” cause-and-result crimes,
like murder and battery, long recognized at common law.
See ante, at 12.
   We have no business entertaining an argument like that.
In §924(c)(3)(A), Congress did not ask us to plumb the leg-
islative mind or to do whatever it takes to ensure the stat-
ute reaches certain cause-and-result crimes familiar to the
common law. Instead, Congress told us exactly what qual-
ifies as a “crime of violence” for purposes of this law: an
offense that has “as an element” the “use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force.” §924(c)(3)(A). And, as
this Court has often explained, when Congress takes the
trouble to supply an express definition, we are obliged to
treat it as “virtually conclusive,” even—and perhaps espe-
cially—if it “varies” from what we might otherwise under-
stand (or wish) the definition to be. See Department of Ag-
riculture Rural Development Rural Housing Service v.
Kirtz, 601 U. S. 42, 59 (2024); Scalia & Garner 228 (“It is
very rare that a defined meaning can be replaced with an-
other permissible meaning of the word . . . ”).

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

   The Court offers no persuasive answer to any of this. To
be sure, the Court protests that it merely seeks to give voice
to the “conventional meaning” of the phrase “crime of vio-
lence.” Ante, at 14. But the Court’s focus on that phrase in
isolation, followed by an insistence that it must capture
common-law cause-and-result crimes like murder and bat-
tery—all without any serious attention to the express defi-
nition Congress gave us or so much contextual evidence
about its meaning—leaves little room for doubt that pur-
pose, not text, is in the driver’s seat today.
   In saying that much, I do not mean to suggest courts may
never look to the common law to inform statutory text.
Sometimes, courts properly consider the common law when
interpreting a term of art Congress has adapted from that
“old soil.” See, e.g., Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. 729,
733 (2013). And, yes, we may sometimes resort to the com-
mon law when a statute leaves a gap (say, by failing to sup-
ply a burden of proof or the requisite mens rea). See, e.g.,
Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 262 (1952).
   The trouble is, we have nothing like that here. Before us
is an express statutory definition that bears no resemblance
to traditional common-law terms and leaves no gap to fill.
The Court does not claim otherwise. Nor could it, for we
have been down this road before. In Johnson, the govern-
ment asked this Court to draw from common-law liability
principles to inform parallel statutory language in §924(e).
The Court refused that request because it threatened to
generate only a “comical misfit.” 559 U. S., at 145; see also
Castleman, 572 U. S., at 175 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (“expan-
sive common-law” principles cannot displace the “statutory
text” of §924(e)).
   The same holds true here. By looking to the common law
today, the Court produces a serious misfit. At common law,
an omission could give rise to liability for a cause-and-result
crime only if the defendant had a well-defined legal duty to
act (think of a doctor’s duty to his patient, or a father’s duty
16              DELLIGATTI v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

to his child). See 1 LaFave & Scott §3.3, at 283. Yet the
Court’s reading of §924(c)(3)(A) renders the presence of a
legal duty irrelevant—as the Court sees it, knowingly or in-
tentionally causing bodily injury by failing to act is always
a “crime of violence.” Ante, at 4. In the name of revising
this statute to better track common-law cause-and-result
crimes, then, the Court (ironically) expands the frontiers of
criminal liability in ways utterly unknown to the common
law.
  Along the way, the Court hands us another misfit, too,
this one having to do with our own precedents. In Johnson,
the government asked the Court to read the phrase “physi-
cal force” in a statute addressing “violent felon[ies]” to reach
mere touchings consistent with the common law of battery.
See 559 U. S., at 140. Here, the government goes a step
further, asking us to read the phrase “physical force” in a
statute addressing “felony” “crimes of violence” to embrace
common-law cause-and-result crimes (including battery)
where not even a mere touching is required. How the Court
might reject the first request and indulge the second poses
quite the puzzle. If there is some way to reconcile today’s
decision with Johnson, the Court never explains what it
might be.
                              B
  Not only do we have no business guessing about unex-
pressed legislative intentions. Even were we to play that
game, the Court’s intuition that Congress must have wanted
§924(c)(3)(A) to reach “prototypical” cause-and-result crimes
might well be wrong.
  Consider a little more closely the concern the Court asks
us to ascribe to Congress. The Court cannot really suppose
that Congress wanted us to ensure that cause-and-result
crimes committed by omission qualify as “crimes of vio-
lence” under §924(c)(3)(A). After all, omission offenses
would trigger a sentencing enhancement under §924(c)(1)
                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            17

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

only in the most unusual circumstances. Just ask yourself:
How would our spiteful lifeguard “us[e],” “carr[y],” or “pos-
ses[s]” a firearm during and in relation to his crime of inac-
tion? §924(c)(1)(A).
   Really, the Court’s argument must rest on a different as-
sumption. It must rest on a view that Congress implicitly
wanted §924(c)(1)’s sentencing enhancements to apply to
cause-and-effect crimes, like Mr. Delligatti’s, where an in-
dividual uses, carries, or possesses a gun to commit a vio-
lent act that causes bodily injury. Ante, at 10–11. To en-
sure that §924(c)(1) does its intended job of reaching those
“prototypical” crimes of violence, the Court goes big. It asks
us to accept the (implausible) notion that cause-and-result
crimes resulting in bodily injury always, even when com-
mitted by omission, require the government to prove as an
element “the use . . . of physical force.” §924(c)(3)(A); ante,
at 10.
   But even if Congress implicitly wanted §924(c)(1)’s sen-
tencing enhancements to reach cause-and-result crimes
that are committed by act and cause bodily harm, there is
no reason to suppose Congress wanted us to mangle
§924(c)(3)(A) to get the job done. Recall that §924(c)(1)’s
sentencing enhancements apply to a “crime of violence” as
that phrase is defined either in the elements clause before
us (§924(c)(3)(A)) or in the residual clause (§924(c)(3)(B)).
See Part I–C, supra. By its terms, the latter clause “sweeps
more broadly.” Davis, 588 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation
marks omitted). It does not require an examination of the
elements the government must prove to secure a conviction,
let alone demand that those elements require proof of the
use of physical force. Instead, the residual clause reaches
offenses that, in “ordinary” cases, pose a “risk of physical
injury.” Id., at 452 (quoting §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). And Con-
gress might well have thought the residual clause the more
natural home for cause-and-result crimes like murder and

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

battery, for even if those offenses do not require the govern-
ment to prove as an element the use of physical force, as
committed those offenses typically involve physical force
(and certainly the risk of it).
  Equally, Congress might have had another idea in mind.
Maybe Congress did not mean for §924(c)(1) to reach all
murder and battery offenses. Maybe Congress wanted
§924(c)(1) to reach only those murder and battery offenses
that require the government to prove, as an element, the
use of physical force—or that, by their nature, involve a
substantial risk of such force. After all, States write their
criminal laws in different ways. And, doubtless, some
states draft some murder and battery statutes to focus on
the degree of force a defendant uses, not just the result he
brings about. Maybe Congress honed in on offenses like
that, not all murder and battery crimes, because it thought
those offenses especially deserving of additional punish-
ment. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1111(a) (murder involving the
torture of a child).
  That possibility seems all the more likely because
§924(c)(1)’s enhancements are not the be-all and end-all of
federal sentencing. Even when §924(c)(1)’s enhancements
do not apply, sentencing courts enjoy ample tools to ensure
a defendant’s punishment fits his crime. And that’s no-
where truer than when it comes to those who commit seri-
ous crimes like murder and battery. In this respect, Mr.
Delligatti’s case is illustrative. The district court sentenced
him to 25 years in prison—20 years for his offenses related
to attempted murder, plus 5 additional years under §924(c).
See Judgment in No. 15–491 (SDNY, Aug. 20, 2018), ECF
Doc. 729, p. 3. But even without a §924(c) enhancement,
the advisory guidelines suggested, and the judge was free
to impose, a sentence of up to 28 years. See Sentencing
Submission for United States, ECF Doc. 712, at 10–14; ac-
cord, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. The judge, too, was free to
depart or vary from the recommended guidelines range to

impose an even harsher sentence had she deemed it appro-
priate. See 18 U. S. C. §3553(b).
  Nor would recognizing that §924(c)(3)(A) fails to reach
Mr. Delligatti’s offense guarantee him some windfall. Do-
ing so would leave the district court free, on remand, to im-
pose exactly the same sentence it did the first time around,
or maybe even a harsher one yet. See Dean v. United
States, 581 U. S. 62, 69 (2017). Nothing about Mr. Delli-
gatti’s case is unique either. With or without a §924(c)(1)
enhancement, those convicted of serious offenses in our fed-
eral criminal justice system routinely face serious sen-
tences and judges amply equipped with the means to issue
them.
                              *
  In the end, the Court’s decision today comes up short on
every count. It neglects §924(c)(3)(A)’s definitional terms
and their ordinary meaning. It ignores important contex-
tual clues. It leans heavily on only two, ultimately unhelp-
ful, precedents without addressing others. And it resorts to
conjecture about implicit congressional purposes that is un-
convincing on its own terms. To my mind, none of the
Court’s arguments can overcome the hard fact that crimes
of omission do not involve the “use . . . of physical force
against another.” Individuals like our lifeguard who com-
mit offenses by omission may face punishment under many
other criminal laws, but §924(c)(3)(A) does not reach them.
Even if a reasonable doubt remained about that common-
sense conclusion (I confess I harbor none), the rule of lenity
would require us to reach the same result anyway. See
Bittner v. United States, 598 U. S. 85, 101 (2023). For all
these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
