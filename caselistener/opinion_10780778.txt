CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

  No. 23–217.      Argued November 5, 2024—Decided January 15, 2025
In 1938, Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), guar-
  anteeing a federal minimum wage for covered workers, 29 U. S. C.
  §206(a)(1), and requiring overtime pay for those working more than 40
  hours per week, §207(a)(1). Congress exempted many types of employ-
  ees from the FLSA’s overtime-pay requirement, including outside
  salesmen who primarily work away from their employer’s place of busi-
  ness. §213(a)(1). The law places the burden on the employer to show
  that an exemption applies.
     Petitioner EMD distributes food products in the Washington, D. C.,
  area and employs sales representatives who manage inventory and
  take orders at grocery stores. Several sales representatives sued EMD
  alleging that the company violated the FLSA by failing to pay them
  overtime. EMD argued that the sales representatives were outside
  salesmen and therefore exempt from the FLSA’s overtime-pay require-
  ment. After a bench trial, the District Court found EMD liable for
  overtime because EMD did not prove by clear and convincing evidence
  that its sales representatives were outside salesmen. On appeal, EMD
  argued that the District Court should have used the less stringent pre-
  ponderance-of-the-evidence standard instead of the clear-and-convinc-
  ing-evidence standard. Applying Circuit precedent, the Fourth Circuit
  disagreed and affirmed the District Court’s judgment.
Held: The preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applies when an em-
 ployer seeks to demonstrate that an employee is exempt from the min-
 imum-wage and overtime-pay provisions of the FLSA. Pp. 4–8.
    (a) When Congress enacted the FLSA in 1938, the preponderance-
 of-the-evidence standard was the default in American civil litigation,
 and it remains so today. In civil litigation, the Court has deviated from
 this default standard in three main circumstances. First, if a statute
2                    E.M.D. SALES, INC. v. CARRERA

                                  Syllabus

    requires a heightened standard of proof, courts must apply it. See, e.g.,
    §§218c(b)(1), 464(c). Second, the Constitution can mandate a height-
    ened standard of proof. See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
    U. S. 254; Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418. Third, in certain rare
    situations involving coercive Government action, such as taking away
    a person’s citizenship, a heightened standard may apply. See, e.g.,
    Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 129. But in most civil cases, including
    employment-discrimination cases under Title VII, the Court has con-
    sistently applied the preponderance standard. See, e.g., Price Water-
    house v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228. Pp. 4–6.
       (b) The FLSA does not specify a standard of proof for exemptions,
    and when a civil statute is silent, courts typically apply the preponder-
    ance standard. See, e.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279. This case
    does not involve constitutional rights that would require a heightened
    standard, nor does it involve the Government taking unusual or coer-
    cive action against an individual. FLSA cases are similar to Title VII
    employment-discrimination cases, where the Court has applied the
    preponderance standard. P. 6.
       (c) The employees’ policy-laden arguments for a heightened stand-
    ard are unconvincing. Their argument that the FLSA protects the pub-
    lic interest in a fair economy does not necessitate a heightened stand-
    ard. Other workplace protections, like those under Title VII, also serve
    important public interests but are subject to the preponderance stand-
    ard. The employees argue that rights under the FLSA are nonwai-
    vable and therefore different from other rights subject to the prepon-
    derance standard. But waivability of a right does not determine the
    standard of proof. Pp. 7–8.
       Whether the employees would fail to qualify as outside salesmen
    even under a preponderance standard is left for the Court of Appeals
    on remand. P. 8.
75 F. 4th 345, reversed and remanded.

    KAVANAUGH, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. GOR-
SUCH, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which THOMAS, J., joined.

     E.M.D. SALES, INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS v.
       FAUSTINO SANCHEZ CARRERA, ET AL.
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
                              [January 15, 2025]

  JUSTICE KAVANAUGH delivered the opinion of the Court.
  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires employers
to pay their employees a minimum wage and overtime
compensation. But the Act also exempts many categories
of employees from the minimum-wage and overtime-
compensation requirements. The dispute here concerns the
standard of proof that an employer must satisfy to show
that an employee is exempt. The usual standard of proof in
civil litigation is preponderance of the evidence. A more
demanding standard, such as clear and convincing
evidence, applies only when a statute or the Constitution
requires a heightened standard or in certain other rare
cases, such as “when the government seeks to take unusual
coercive action—action more dramatic than entering an
award of money damages or other conventional relief—
against an individual.” Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490
U. S. 228, 253 (1989) (plurality opinion). None of those
exceptions applies to this case.           Therefore, the
preponderance-of-the-evidence standard governs when an
employer attempts to demonstrate that an employee is
exempt.
2              E.M.D. SALES, INC. v. CARRERA

                     Opinion of the Court

                               I
                               A
  In 1938, Congress passed and President Franklin
Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act. 52 Stat.
1060. The Act guarantees covered workers a federal
minimum wage. See 29 U. S. C. §206(a)(1). The Act also
generally requires overtime pay when a covered employee
works more than 40 hours per week. See §207(a)(1).
  But Congress recognized that a minimum wage and
overtime pay would be impractical or inappropriate for
some jobs. So the Act exempts many categories of
employees from the minimum-wage requirement and
exempts many more from the overtime-pay requirement.
See §§213(a)–(b). Exempt employees can range from
baseball players to seamen to maple-syrup processors to
software engineers to firefighters, and so on.          See
§§213(a)(12), (17), (19), (b)(15), (20). The law places the
burden on the employer to show that an exemption applies.
See Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188, 196–
197 (1974).
  The exemption relevant here encompasses anyone
employed “in the capacity of outside salesman.” §213(a)(1).
An “outside salesman” primarily makes sales and regularly
works away from the employer’s place of business. See
Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. 142,
148 (2012); 29 CFR §541.500(a) (2023).
                              B
  EMD distributes international food products in the
Washington, D. C., metropolitan area. EMD employs sales
representatives who manage inventory and take orders at
grocery stores that stock EMD products.
  Several EMD sales representatives sued the company in
the U. S. District Court for the District of Maryland. They
alleged that EMD violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by
failing to pay them overtime. EMD did not deny that the
                 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            3

                     Opinion of the Court

employees worked more than 40 hours per week without
receiving overtime pay.       But EMD argued that the
employees fell within the Act’s outside-salesman
exemption.
  Following a bench trial, the District Court concluded that
EMD failed to prove “by clear and convincing evidence” that
the employees qualified as outside salesmen.             Civ.
No. 17–3066 (D Md., Mar. 19, 2021), App. to Pet. for Cert.
49a. The court found that the employees primarily
executed the terms of sales already made rather than
making new sales themselves. The court therefore ordered
EMD to pay overtime wages and liquidated damages.
  On appeal, EMD contended that the District Court
should have applied the less stringent preponderance-of-
the-evidence standard rather than the clear-and-
convincing-evidence standard. The U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the judgment
of the District Court. 75 F. 4th 345 (2023). The Court of
Appeals followed Circuit precedent requiring employers to
prove the applicability of Fair Labor Standards Act
exemptions by clear and convincing evidence. Id., at 351–
352. Although the three-judge panel suggested that the full
court might want to reconsider that precedent en banc, the
court later denied en banc review. Id., at 353.
  The Fourth Circuit stands alone in requiring employers
to prove the applicability of Fair Labor Standards Act
exemptions by clear and convincing evidence. Every other
Court of Appeals to address the issue has held that the
preponderance standard applies. See Faludi v. U. S. Shale
Solutions, L.L.C., 950 F. 3d 269, 273 (CA5 2020); Renfro v.
Indiana Mich. Power Co., 497 F. 3d 573, 576 (CA6 2007); Yi
v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc., 480 F. 3d 505, 506–508
(CA7 2007); Coast Van Lines, Inc. v. Armstrong, 167 F. 2d
705, 707 (CA9 1948); Lederman v. Frontier Fire Protection,
Inc., 685 F. 3d 1151, 1158 (CA10 2012); Dybach v. Florida
Dept. of Corrections, 942 F. 2d 1562, 1566, n. 5 (CA11 1991).
4               E.M.D. SALES, INC. v. CARRERA

                      Opinion of the Court

This Court granted certiorari to resolve that conflict. 602
U. S. ___ (2024).
                              II
                              A
   In 1938, when Congress enacted the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the established default standard of proof in
American civil litigation was the preponderance-of-the-
evidence standard. The Court’s cases pre-dating the Act
recognized as much. See United States v. Regan, 232 U. S.
37, 48 (1914); Lilienthal’s Tobacco v. United States, 97 U. S.
237, 266 (1878). As did prominent treatises. See 4 J.
Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law §2498,
pp. 3545–3546 (1905); 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence §29,
p. 28 (8th ed. 1867).
   Since then, the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard
has remained the default standard of proof in American
civil litigation.     That default makes sense:            The
preponderance standard allows both parties in the mine-
run civil case to “share the risk of error in roughly equal
fashion.” Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,
390 (1983) (quotation marks omitted).
   In civil litigation, this Court has deviated from the
preponderance standard in three main circumstances.
   First, courts must apply a heightened standard of proof if
a statute establishes one. For example, various provisions
of the U. S. Code, including some involving labor and
employment, designate clear and convincing evidence as
the applicable standard of proof. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.
§218c(b)(1) (whistleblower-retaliation claims under the
Fair Labor Standards Act); §464(c) (validity of union-
established trusteeships); §722(a)(3)(A)(ii) (ineligibility for
vocational rehabilitation services). The same can be true
when Congress uses a term with a settled common-law
meaning that itself required a heightened standard of proof.
See, e.g., Microsoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U. S. 91, 102
                 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

(2011).
   Second, courts likewise must apply a heightened
standard of proof when the Constitution requires one. For
example, the Court has mandated a clear-and-convincing-
evidence standard in certain First Amendment cases. See,
e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285–
286 (1964); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 342
(1974). The Court has also held that the Due Process
Clause necessitates a heightened standard in some cases.
In Addington v. Texas, for example, the Court ruled that
involuntary civil commitment constitutes such a
“significant deprivation of liberty” by the government that
“due process requires the state to justify confinement by
proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the
evidence.” 441 U. S. 418, 425–427 (1979). And in Santosky
v. Kramer, the Court held the same with respect to the
government’s termination of parental rights: “Before a
State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of
parents in their natural child, due process requires that the
State support its allegations by at least clear and
convincing evidence.” 455 U. S. 745, 747–748 (1982).
   Third, under this Court’s precedents, a heightened
standard of proof may be appropriate in certain other
“uncommon” cases. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S.
228, 253 (1989) (plurality opinion). These cases “ordinarily”
arise “when the government seeks to take unusual coercive
action—action more dramatic than entering an award of
money damages or other conventional relief—against an
individual.” Ibid. For example, the Court has held that the
government must satisfy a clear-and-convincing-evidence
standard in order to take away a person’s citizenship. See
Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 129, 137–138 (1958)
(expatriation); Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S.
118, 122–123 (1943) (denaturalization).
   Importantly, the Court has not otherwise used a
heightened standard in civil matters. See Halo Electronics,
6              E.M.D. SALES, INC. v. CARRERA

                      Opinion of the Court

Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U. S. 93, 107 (2016)
(treble damages under the Patent Act); Grogan v. Garner,
498 U. S. 279, 286–287 (1991) (bankruptcy discharges);
Herman & MacLean, 459 U. S., at 389–390 (securities
fraud); Regan, 232 U. S., at 48–49 (civil-penalty suit under
the Alien Immigration Act). Most relevant here, the Court
has applied a preponderance standard in Title VII
employment-discrimination cases. See Price Waterhouse,
490 U. S., at 253–254 (plurality opinion); id., at 260 (White,
J., concurring in judgment); id., at 261 (O’Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment).
                               B
   We conclude that the default preponderance standard
governs when an employer seeks to prove that an employee
is exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   First, as the employees acknowledge, the Fair Labor
Standards Act does not specify a standard of proof for the
Act’s exemptions. Faced with silence, courts usually apply
the default preponderance standard. Statutory silence is
generally “inconsistent with the view that Congress
intended to require a special, heightened standard of proof.”
Grogan, 498 U. S., at 286.
   Second, as the employees recognize, this case does not
implicate any constitutional rights that might require a
heightened standard.
   Third, this is not a case where the government otherwise
seeks to take “unusual coercive action” against an
individual. Price Waterhouse, 490 U. S., at 253 (plurality
opinion). Cases under the Fair Labor Standards Act are
more akin to the Title VII cases where the Court has held
that a preponderance standard applies. If clear and
convincing evidence is not required in Title VII cases, it is
hard to see why it would be required in Fair Labor
Standards Act cases.

                      Opinion of the Court

                              III
  We are not persuaded by the employees’ policy-laden
arguments for a heightened standard when an employer
seeks to show that an employee is exempt. The employees
contend that the Act focuses not on the individual’s interest
in damages, but rather on the public’s interest in a well-
functioning economy where workers are guaranteed a fair
wage. But that premise, even if accepted, does not demand
a heightened standard.         After all, other workplace
protections that vindicate important public interests
remain subject to the preponderance standard. Eradicating
discrimination from the workplace is undoubtedly
important. Yet as explained above, this Court has held that
a preponderance standard is appropriate for Title VII cases.
See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 253–254
(1989) (plurality opinion).
  In addition, the public interest in Fair Labor Standards
Act cases does not fall entirely on the side of employees.
Most legislation reflects a balance of competing interests.
So it is here. Rather than choose sides in a policy debate,
this Court must apply the statute as written and as
informed by the longstanding default rule regarding the
standard of proof.
  Next, the employees contend that the minimum-wage
and overtime-pay rights conferred by the Fair Labor
Standards Act are not waivable and are therefore distinct
from other rights subject to a preponderance standard. But
the waivability (or lack thereof ) of a right does not dictate
the applicable standard of proof. Consider the criminal
process. Even though the prosecution must meet a high
standard of proof—beyond a reasonable doubt—criminal
defendants may waive their right to trial by pleading guilty.
At the same time, some rights that are not waivable are
subject to the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. For
example, certain rights conferred by the National Labor
Relations Act are not waivable. See National Licorice Co.
8              E.M.D. SALES, INC. v. CARRERA

                     Opinion of the Court

v. NLRB, 309 U. S. 350, 360–361 (1940); McLaren Macomb,
372 N. L. R. B. No. 58, pp. 5–6 (2023). Yet employers may
prove affirmative defenses to those rights by a
preponderance. See NLRB v. Transportation Management
Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 400, 403 (1983).
   As those cases illustrate, the waivability of a right and
the standard of proof are two distinct inquiries. Therefore,
although at least some Fair Labor Standards Act rights are
not waivable, it does not follow that a heightened standard
of proof must apply when an employer attempts to show
that an employee is exempt.
   Finally, the employees assert that a heightened standard
should govern in Fair Labor Standards Act cases because
the employer controls much of the evidence relevant to
establishing a violation and because plaintiffs in those
cases may have low incomes. But in Title VII cases too,
employers control “most of the cards,” and plaintiffs may be
low-income. Murray v. UBS Securities, LLC, 601 U. S. 23,
36 (2024) (quotation marks omitted).               Yet the
preponderance standard applies in those cases. So too here.
                        *    *     *
  We hold that the preponderance-of-the-evidence
standard applies when an employer seeks to show that an
employee is exempt from the minimum-wage and overtime-
pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The
employees argue that we should still affirm because they
would not qualify as outside salesmen even under a
preponderance standard. But our usual practice is to leave
matters of that sort for remand. We see no persuasive
reason to stray from that usual practice here. We therefore
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

                                            It is so ordered.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
                       [January 15, 2025]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,
concurring.
   Sometimes, the Constitution or Congress provides a par-
ticular standard of proof. See ante, at 4–5. If not, courts
must find one. As in other contexts, they do so by examin-
ing the legal backdrop against which Congress has legis-
lated. See, e.g., Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 17
(2006); cf. Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501
U. S. 104, 108 (1991) (“Congress is understood to legislate
against a background of common-law adjudicatory princi-
ples”). In civil cases, those background legal principles typ-
ically require proof by a preponderance of the evidence. See
ante, at 4. Occasionally, though, the default “common-law
rule” provides instead for a “heightened standard of proof.”
Microsoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U. S. 91, 116 (2011)
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Either way, courts
apply the default standard unless Congress alters it or the
Constitution forbids it. See, e.g., Octane Fitness, LLC v.
ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U. S. 545, 557–558 (2014).
To do otherwise would be to “choose sides in a policy de-
bate,” ante, at 7, rather than to declare the law as our judi-
cial duty requires. Our decision today is consistent with
this understanding, and I am pleased to join it.
