CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

   No. 24–5438.      Argued October 14, 2025—Decided January 9, 2026


Petitioner Michael S. Bowe is serving a 24-year sentence in federal cus-
  tody after pleading guilty in 2008 to three offenses: (1) conspiracy to
  commit Hobbs Act robbery; (2) attempted Hobbs Act robbery; and (3)
  using a firearm in relation to a “crime of violence” as defined in
  18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Bowe’s §924(c) conviction carried a manda-
  tory 10-year sentence to be served consecutively to his sentence for the
  robbery offenses. To have been properly convicted under §924(c), at
  least one of Bowe’s other offenses must qualify as a “crime of violence”
  under one of two definitional clauses in §924(c): the “elements clause,”
  §924(c)(3)(A), or the “residual clause,” §924(c)(3)(B). But decisions is-
  sued years after Bowe’s conviction call into question whether either
  clause can support his §924(c) conviction. See United States v. Davis,
  588 U. S. 445, 470 (residual clause void for vagueness); United States
  v. Taylor, 596 U. S. 845, 860 (attempted Hobbs Act robbery is not a
  crime of violence under the elements clause).
    This case concerns Bowe’s efforts to obtain postconviction relief from
  the mandatory consecutive 10-year sentence imposed under §924(c). A
  comprehensive statutory scheme governs when and how state and fed-
  eral prisoners can seek postconviction relief in federal court. See 28
  U. S. C. §2254 (state prisoners); §2255 (federal prisoners). Particu-
  larly relevant here, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-
  alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), second or subsequent efforts at obtaining
  postconviction relief require the prisoner first to seek certification from
  a court of appeals that the filing meets threshold conditions before a
  prisoner can proceed in a district court. See §2244 (authorization re-
  quests by state prisoners); §2255(h) (successive-motion requests by
  federal prisoners).      While §§2244 and 2255(h) have distinct
2                        BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                                   Syllabus

    requirements, §2255(h) cross-references some of the procedures in
    §2244 for how a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals” “certifie[s]”
    a second or successive filing.
       Bowe first sought §2255 relief in 2016, arguing that §924(c)’s resid-
    ual clause was unconstitutional. The District Court denied the motion,
    reasoning that—regardless of the residual clause’s constitutionality—
    Bowe’s §924(c) conviction was proper because attempted Hobbs Act
    robbery qualified as a “crime of violence” under the elements clause.
    In 2019, after Davis, Bowe sought permission from the Eleventh Cir-
    cuit under §2255(h) to file a second or successive motion. A three-judge
    panel found that Bowe had not met §2255(h)’s threshold conditions.
    Although the panel acknowledged that Davis announced a new, retro-
    active constitutional rule (one of the two statutory gateways for suc-
    cessive motions under §2255(h)(2)), it held that Bowe could not make
    a prima facie showing that his §924(c) conviction was unconstitutional
    because then-binding Circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs
    Act robbery as a “crime of violence” under the elements clause. After
    Taylor was decided in 2022, Bowe once again sought authorization un-
    der §2255(h), arguing that Davis and Taylor leave none of his convic-
    tions as a valid predicate “crime of violence” under §924(c). A panel
    dismissed the part of Bowe’s request resting on Davis, reasoning that
    the claim had been “presented in a prior application” and that the
    panel lacked jurisdiction over such old claims under §2244(b)(1). The
    panel also denied the part of Bowe’s request that rested on Taylor, con-
    cluding that Taylor did not announce a new constitutional rule within
    the meaning of §2255(h)(2). Bowe returned to the Eleventh Circuit
    several times, seeking authorization to pursue postconviction relief,
    initial hearing en banc, and reversal of Circuit precedent applying
    §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to federal prisoners’ successive §2255 mo-
    tions. He also requested certification of the question whether
    §2244(b)(1) applies to federal prisoners. See §1254(2). Bowe’s requests
    were denied. Bowe eventually filed this petition for certiorari, pointing
    out a circuit split: Six Circuits apply §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to fed-
    eral prisoners, while three do not. The Court granted review.
Held:
    1. The Court has jurisdiction because §2244(b)(3)(E) does not bar
 this Court’s review of a federal prisoner’s request to file a second or
 successive §2255 motion. Pp. 5–19.
       (a) Section 2244(b)(3)(E) provides that the denial of authorization
 “to file a second or successive application” shall not be the subject of a
 certiorari petition. That provision does not apply to federal prisoners.
 It is housed within §2244, which imposes several strict requirements
 that apply only to state prisoners. It also speaks only to a “second or
 successive application,” §2244(b)(3)(E), but unlike state prisoners who
                     Cite as: 607 U. S. ___ (2026)                      3

                               Syllabus

file such “applications,” federal prisoners file “motions,” see §2255(e).
Pp. 5–8.
     (b) The Government contends that §2255(h)’s cross-reference to
§2244—providing that a successive motion must be “certified as pro-
vided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to
contain” the content requirements in §2255(h)—also imports §2244’s
certiorari bar. But §2255(h)’s cross-reference, coupled with its context,
does not provide the clear indication needed to strip this Court of ju-
risdiction. Given the broad grant of certiorari jurisdiction to the Court,
see §1254(1), Congress must speak clearly if it seeks to impose excep-
tions to that jurisdiction. In Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, a
case also brought by a federal prisoner, the Court held that
§2244(b)(3)(E) posed no bar to its review, explaining that the Govern-
ment’s reading would close the Court’s doors to a class of habeas peti-
tioners “without any clear indication” that Congress intended such a
result. Id., at 381. The same “clear indication” necessary in Castro to
strip the Court of jurisdiction is required here: The §2244(b)(3)(E) is-
sue arises in the same context and the Government argues that the
very same provision bars the Court’s review in this case. This clear
indication is not a “magic words” requirement; it simply asks whether
text and structure unambiguously show that Congress intended to pre-
vent the Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction. A provision that
can reasonably be read more than one way in context is not sufficiently
clear.
   Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference does not provide the clear indica-
tion of intent required to strip the Court of jurisdiction. The language
of the cross-reference is both narrow and specific. It says that a second
or successive §2255 motion “must be certified as provided in section
2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain” one of
two threshold content requirements. It incorporates only the provi-
sions in §2244 that “provid[e]” for how a “panel of the appropriate court
of appeals” “certifie[s]” a second or successive filing and directs that
those procedures be used to evaluate whether the filing “contain[s]”
the content requirements listed in §2255(h). Section 2244(b)(3)(E) is
not one of those provisions, and it has nothing to do with the content
requirements in §2255(h).
   For these reasons and others, whether §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar
falls within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference is at most ambigu-
ous. Ambiguous language cannot provide the required clear indica-
tion, and the Government’s remaining arguments do not supply the
necessary clarity that the text lacks. The Government also suggests
that it would make little sense to bar certiorari review of authorization
decisions concerning state prisoners but not federal ones. That
4                       BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                                   Syllabus

    argument carries little weight when the governing standard requires
    Congress to speak clearly. Moreover, Congress treated state and fed-
    eral prisoners differently across AEDPA, with state prisoners often
    facing far higher hurdles to relief. Allowing further review in this
    Court is thus consistent with both AEDPA’s purposes and practical
    considerations. Pp. 8–19.
       2. Section 2244(b)(1) does not apply to second or successive motions
    filed under §2255(h) by federal prisoners challenging their convictions
    or sentences. Pp. 19–25.
          (a) The text of §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar states that “[a] claim
    presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under
    section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dis-
    missed.” State prisoners alone file habeas corpus applications under
    §2254. That specific reference to §2254 was deliberate: Elsewhere in
    this very section, Congress expressly distinguishes §2254 “applica-
    tions” from §2255 “motions.” §2266(a); see also §§2253(c)(1)(A)–(B)
    (distinguishing state habeas proceedings from proceedings under
    §2255). When interpreting statutes, the Court presumes that “differ-
    ences in language like this convey differences in meaning.” Henson v.
    Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U. S. 79, 86. By its plain terms,
    §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies only to state prisoners. P. 20.
          (b) Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 does not make
    §2244(b)(1) applicable to federal prisoners’ successive §2255 motions.
    Amicus contends that §2255(h) incorporates §2244, including
    §2244(b)(3)(C), which requires a panel to determine that “the applica-
    tion makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the requirements
    of this subsection.” From here, one of the “requirements of . . . subsec-
    tion” (b) is §2244(b)(1). Accordingly, amicus argues, following this
    chain of cross-references leads to the conclusion that §2244(b)(1) must
    apply to federal prisoners. But that position is erroneous under the
    same reasoning that explains why the Court has jurisdiction. Section
    2255(h)’s cross-reference incorporates the procedures in §2244 only as
    they relate to how a panel certifies a second or successive filing. At
    bottom, the best textual reading of both §2255(h) and §2244(b) is that,
    when a federal prisoner moves for authorization, a panel can authorize
    the filing if the filing makes a prima facie showing that it satisfies one
    of the two grounds in §2255(h), the “two—and only two—conditions in
    which a second or successive §2255 motion may proceed.” Jones v.
    Hendrix, 599 U. S. 465, 477.
       The argument that Congress meant for AEDPA to treat second or
    successive filings by federal and state prisoners the same fails.
    AEDPA is replete with examples of Congress treating state and federal
    prisoners differently—including in the context of limitations on second
    or successive filings. Any concern associated with Congress allowing

                                Syllabus

  old-claim litigation for federal prisoners is overstated given that all
  claims, even the repeat ones, must meet the “strictly limited” threshold
  requirements of §2255(h), Jones, 599 U. S., at 476, and should they
  survive that review, they must still conform with the demanding stat-
  ute of limitations contained in §2255(f ), Dodd v. United States, 545
  U. S. 353, 359. Very few claims will satisfy either, let alone both. The
  Court leaves it to the Eleventh Circuit to determine in the first in-
  stance whether Bowe should receive authorization to file a second or
  successive motion under the correct standard. Pp. 20–25.

 MICHAEL BOWE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                               [January 9, 2026]

   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Congress has created a comprehensive scheme to address
when and how state and federal prisoners can seek postcon-
viction relief in federal courts. A state prisoner can file an
application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C.
§2254. A federal prisoner, by contrast, can file a motion to
vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence under §2255. Each
provision contains its own procedural and substantive re-
quirements that an individual must satisfy.
   This case concerns the more complicated situation when
a prisoner returns to federal court after a prior attempt for
relief has failed. In this situation, Congress has enlisted
the courts of appeals to play a gatekeeping role in the con-
sideration of second or successive filings brought by federal
and state prisoners. Under this system, before a prisoner
can bring such a filing in a district court, a court of appeals
must certify that the filing meets certain threshold condi-
tions. Section 2244 governs authorization requests made
by state prisoners, and §2255(h), in turn, governs requests
made by federal prisoners. The two have distinct require-
ments, but through a limited cross-reference in §2255(h) to
§2244 for how a filing is “certified” by a “panel,” Congress
2                  BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                       Opinion of the Court

has borrowed certain of the procedures that apply to state
prisoners and applies them to federal prisoners too.
   This case presents two questions regarding which aspects
of §2244 fall within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference.
The first is whether §2244(b)(3)(E), which prohibits the “de-
nial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second
or successive application” from being the “subject of a peti-
tion for . . . a writ of certiorari,” bars this Court’s review of
authorization decisions concerning the motions of federal
prisoners. If it does, this Court would lack jurisdiction to
hear this case. The Court holds that it does not. In the
narrow cross-reference to the procedures in §2244, Con-
gress has not clearly indicated that it intended to incorpo-
rate §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar.
   The second question is whether §2244(b)(1), which directs
courts to dismiss a claim “presented in a second or succes-
sive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was
presented in a prior application,” applies to motions filed by
federal prisoners. It does not: Section 2244(b)(1), by its ex-
press terms, applies only to state prisoners’ habeas applica-
tions under §2254, not to federal prisoners’ motions under
§2255.
                               I
   Petitioner Michael S. Bowe is in federal custody. In 2008,
he pleaded guilty to three offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit
Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U. S. C. §1951(a); (2) attempt to com-
mit Hobbs Act robbery, ibid.; and (3) the use, carrying,
brandishing, or discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime
of violence, §924(c)(1)(A). Bowe received a 24-year sen-
tence; 10 of those years were imposed because of the §924(c)
conviction, which carried a mandatory 10-year sentence
consecutive to the sentence for the predicate robbery of-
fenses. See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Bowe did not appeal.
   In the decade since, this Court has issued several deci-
sions that have called Bowe’s §924(c) conviction into
                  Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)            3

                      Opinion of the Court

question. To appreciate the implications of those decisions,
it is important first to understand how §924(c) operates.
   Section 924(c) applies if, as relevant here, an individual
commits a qualifying “crime of violence” with a firearm. A
“crime of violence,” in turn, is defined in two ways. Under
the “elements clause,” it is a “felony” that “has as an ele-
ment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against the person or property of another.”
§924(c)(3)(A). Under the “residual clause,” it is a felony
“that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical
force against the person or property of another may be used
in the course of committing the offense.” §924(c)(3)(B). For
Bowe to have been properly convicted under §924(c)—and
thus to have received the accompanying 10-year consecu-
tive sentence—his conviction for either conspiracy or at-
tempt to commit Hobbs Act robbery must qualify as a crime
of violence under either the elements or residual clause.
   Today, it is likely that neither clause would permissibly
support Bowe’s §924(c) conviction. In United States v. Da-
vis, 588 U. S. 445 (2019), this Court held that the residual
clause is unconstitutionally vague. Id., at 470. In United
States v. Taylor, 596 U. S. 845 (2022), the Court held that
attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of
violence under the elements clause. Id., at 860. Eleventh
Circuit precedent is also clear that conspiracy to commit
Hobbs Act robbery does not satisfy the elements clause. See
Brown v. United States, 942 F. 3d 1069, 1075 (2019) (per cu-
riam). If sentenced today, therefore, Bowe likely would not
be subject to the 10-year mandatory consecutive sentence
that he is now serving.
   Nevertheless, the timing of this Court’s decisions, cou-
pled with the timing of Bowe’s efforts to take advantage of
them, have produced procedural complications that have so
far prevented relief, leading to this appeal.
   Bowe, acting pro se, initially sought postconviction relief
under §2255 in 2016, before the Court decided Davis,
4                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

arguing that the residual clause is unconstitutionally
vague. A District Court rejected Bowe’s claim, in part, be-
cause regardless of the residual clause’s constitutionality,
attempted Hobbs Act robbery qualified as a crime of vio-
lence under §924(c)’s elements clause. App. 43.
   After Davis was decided in 2019, Bowe sought permission
from the Eleventh Circuit to file a second or successive mo-
tion. See §2255(h). A three-judge panel declined to author-
ize Bowe’s motion. Although the panel acknowledged that
Davis had announced a new, retroactive rule of constitu-
tional law, which is one of two grounds on which a second
or successive motion can proceed, see §2255(h)(2), it held
that Bowe could not “make a prima facie showing that his
§924(c) conviction and sentence [were] unconstitutional”
because under then-prevailing Eleventh Circuit precedent,
“attempted Hobbs Act robbery” still qualified as a crime of
violence under the elements clause, App. 52–54.
   Then, after Taylor was decided in 2022, Bowe once again
sought permission from the Eleventh Circuit to file a second
or successive motion. This time, Bowe argued that under
Davis and Taylor, none of his convictions qualified as a
predicate “crime of violence.” A three-judge panel dis-
missed the part of Bowe’s request that rested on Davis, rea-
soning that because the claim was “presented in a prior ap-
plication” to file a second or successive motion, the panel
lacked jurisdiction over it under §2244(b)(1). App. 59–60.
The panel also denied the part of Bowe’s request that rested
on Taylor, concluding that Taylor did not announce a new
constitutional rule as needed to secure relief under
§2255(h)(2). App. 59–60.
   Bowe did not stop there. A few months later, he again
sought authorization to file a second or successive motion,
again relying on Davis and Taylor. This time, Bowe also
moved for initial hearing en banc. As relevant, he asked
the Eleventh Circuit to overturn its precedent holding that
§2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies to federal prisoners’
                     Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                    5

                          Opinion of the Court

successive §2255 motions. In Bowe’s view, that bar applies
only to state prisoners, not federal prisoners like him. A
three-judge panel dismissed Bowe’s request for authoriza-
tion, citing §2244(b)(1), and the Eleventh Circuit denied
Bowe’s motion for initial hearing en banc.
   Bowe then moved for an original writ of habeas corpus in
this Court. It was denied. In re Bowe, 601 U. S. ___ (2024).
Bowe returned to the Eleventh Circuit, seeking authoriza-
tion, initial hearing en banc, and certification of the ques-
tion whether §2244(b)(1) applies to federal prisoners. See
§1254(2) (allowing courts of appeals to certify questions of
law to the Supreme Court). As before, a three-judge panel
dismissed Bowe’s request for authorization, relying on
§2244(b)(1). The panel also declined to certify the question
Bowe requested, and the full Eleventh Circuit denied his
motion for initial hearing en banc.
   Finally, Bowe filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The
Eleventh Circuit is one of six Circuits that apply
§2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar to federal prisoners. Three Cir-
cuits do not.1 The Court granted certiorari to resolve the
issue. See 604 U. S. 1096 (2025).
                               II
   As a threshold matter, the Government argues that the
Court cannot resolve the Circuit split concerning
§2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar because the Court lacks jurisdic-
tion to hear the case under §2244(b)(3)(E). That provision
states that the “denial of an authorization by a court of ap-
peals to file a second or successive application . . . shall not
be the subject of a petition for . . . a writ of certiorari.” See

Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. 163, 171
(2009) (“Before turning to the merits, we first must address
our jurisdiction”). If Bowe were in state custody, then the
Government would be correct. See Stewart v. Martinez-Vil-
lareal, 523 U. S. 637, 641 (1998). He is not. Section
2244(b)(3)(E) does not prevent the Court’s review because
the certiorari bar does not clearly apply to motions filed by
federal prisoners like Bowe.
                               A
   In the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA), “Congress established a ‘gatekeeping’
mechanism for the consideration of ‘second or successive’ ”
filings “in the federal courts.” Id., at 641 (quoting Felker v.
Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 657 (1996)). The associated proce-
dural and substantive requirements are “stringent.” Bur-
ton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 152 (2007) (per curiam).
   State prisoners looking to file a second or successive ap-
plication must comply with §2244(b), which provides in rel-
evant part:
      “(3)(A) Before a second or successive application per-
    mitted by this section is filed in the district court, the
    applicant shall move in the appropriate court of ap-
    peals for an order authorizing the district court to con-
    sider the application.
      “(B) A motion in the court of appeals for an order au-
    thorizing the district court to consider a second or suc-
    cessive application shall be determined by a three-
    judge panel of the court of appeals.
      “(C) The court of appeals may authorize the filing of
    a second or successive application only if it determines
    that the application makes a prima facie showing that
    the application satisfies the requirements of this sub-
    section.

                      Opinion of the Court

       “(D) The court of appeals shall grant or deny the au-
    thorization to file a second or successive application not
    later than 30 days after the filing of the motion.
       “(E) The grant or denial of an authorization by a
    court of appeals to file a second or successive applica-
    tion shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject
    of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.
       “(4) A district court shall dismiss any claim pre-
    sented in a second or successive application that the
    court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the
    applicant shows that the claim satisfies the require-
    ments of this section.”
  By comparison, a federal prisoner seeking to file a second
or successive motion must satisfy §2255(h). Jones v. Hen-
drix, 599 U. S. 465, 477–478 (2023). That provision states
in full:
       “A second or successive motion must be certified as
    provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate
    court of appeals to contain—
    “(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and
    viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be suf-
    ficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
    that no reasonable factfinder would have found the mo-
    vant guilty of the offense; or
    “(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive
    to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,
    that was previously unavailable.”
  Unlike the provisions governing authorization decisions
for state prisoners, §2255(h) does not mention this Court’s
certiorari jurisdiction, let alone purport to limit it. Nor does
§2244(b)(3)(E) readily apply to federal prisoners on its face:
Section 2244, overall, imposes several strict requirements
that apply only to state prisoners with the aim of
8                     BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                          Opinion of the Court

facilitating finality,2 and the certiorari bar in particular
speaks to “second or successive applications,” which federal
prisoners do not file, see §2255(e) (federal prisoners must
file “motions” for habeas relief, not applications). Whether
the Court has jurisdiction therefore turns on the scope of
§2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244.
   In the Government’s view, the cross-reference captures
all of §§2244(b)(3) and (b)(4), including the certiorari bar in
§2244(b)(3)(E). Although the Government is correct that
the cross-reference incorporates some of the provisions it
identifies, the Government is wrong that it also incorpo-
rates the certiorari bar. That is because the cross-
reference, coupled with its context, does not provide the
clear indication needed to strip this Court of jurisdiction.

                               1
  This Court has certiorari jurisdiction over any “[c]as[e] in
the courts of appeals . . . upon the petition of any party to
any civil or criminal case, before or after rendition of judg-
ment or decree.” §1254(1). Given that broad grant of juris-
diction, Congress must speak clearly if it seeks to impose
exceptions to that jurisdiction.
  In Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375 (2003), Castro
(a federal prisoner) filed a motion for postconviction relief
in Federal District Court. He had previously filed a motion,
pro se, attacking his conviction, but he had not specifically
labeled it as a §2255 motion. The District Court construed
Castro’s previous filing as his first §2255 motion and the
second filing before it as a second §2255 motion. Because

                           Opinion of the Court

Castro did not receive authorization from the Court of Ap-
peals before filing the second motion, the court dismissed it.
The court, however, granted Castro a certificate of appeal-
ability as to its determination that the motion was his sec-
ond one. See §2253(c). The Court of Appeals later affirmed
the dismissal.
   This Court granted certiorari to address the recharacter-
ization of Castro’s first filing. The Court also asked the par-
ties whether §2244(b)(3)(E) barred its review. Like here,
the Government argued that it did. In the Government’s
view, the Court of Appeals had denied Castro authorization
when it affirmed the District Court’s dismissal, making
that “denial” the “subject” of his “petition for . . . certiorari”
for the purposes of §2244(b)(3)(E). The Court accepted that
characterization of the proceedings below for the sake of ar-
gument, yet disagreed that §2244(b)(3)(E) posed a bar to its
review. Castro, 540 U. S., at 380. That was because the
“subject” of Castro’s petition was not the denial of authori-
zation, but rather “the lower courts’ refusal to recognize
that [the] §2255 motion [was] his first, not his second.”
Ibid.3
   As relevant here, the Court stressed a fatal flaw with the
Government’s argument. As it explained, “reading the stat-
ute as the Government suggest[ed]” to bar jurisdiction in
that case “would close our doors to a class of habeas peti-
tioners seeking review without any clear indication that
——————
  3 The Government stresses, and the dissent echoes, that the Castro

Court “took as a given” that §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal prisoners
by concluding that it had jurisdiction because the subject of the certiorari
petition fell outside of the provision’s scope, not because the provision
applied to state prisoners alone. Brief for United States 18, 30–31. As
the Government elsewhere acknowledges, however, the Court did not ad-
dress the threshold question whether §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal
prisoners. Id., at 31 (observing that Castro “did not even comment on
the issue”). Thus, at most, the Court assumed for the sake of its analysis
that §2244(b)(3)(E) applied. That assumption is not a holding to which
the Court is now bound.
10                     BOWE v. UNITED STATES

such was Congress’ intent.” Id., at 381; cf. Hertz Corp. v.
Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 83–84 (2010) (declining to read “si-
lence or ambiguous language as modifying or limiting [the
Court’s] pre-existing [certiorari] jurisdiction”). That conclu-
sion was also “difficult to reconcile with the basic principle
that ‘we read limitations on our jurisdiction to review nar-
rowly.’ ” Castro, 540 U. S., at 381 (quoting Utah v. Evans,
536 U. S. 452, 463 (2002)).4
  Because a “clear indication” was necessary in Castro to
strip the Court of jurisdiction, a “clear indication” is re-
quired here: The issue arises in the same context and the
Government argues that the very same provision bars the
Court’s review in this case. This clear indication, im-
portantly, is not a so-called “magic words” requirement. It
simply asks whether the text and structure support the un-
ambiguous understanding that Congress intended to pre-
vent this Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction. If a
provision can reasonably be read multiple ways given its
content and context, it is not sufficiently clear.
  The dissent contends that this clear-indication require-
ment comes from “thin air.” Post, at 11–16 (opinion of
GORSUCH, J.). As just explained, however, it comes from
——————
   4 The dissent’s rendition of Castro is mistaken. It suggests that the

clear-indication requirement was tied to the “troublesome resul[t]” that,
under the Government’s interpretation, a prisoner could not appeal a
panel decision characterizing a filing as his first, not his second, even
though the Court had previously allowed the Government to appeal a
decision reaching the opposite result. See Castro, 540 U. S., at 380; Stew-
art v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637, 641–642 (1998); see also post, at
6–7, 14–15 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). That was one troubling result of the
Government’s position, but Castro also listed two more troubling results:
the “clos[ing of] our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review
without any clear indication that such was Congress’ intent,” and the
difficulty in “reconcil[ing]” that outcome “with the basic principle that we
‘read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly.’ ” 540 U. S., at
380–381. The latter two concerns arise here, and thus Castro requires a
clear indication before we will “close our doors” to this distinct class of
prisoners seeking habeas relief.

                           Opinion of the Court

Castro itself. It also draws support from this Court’s histor-
ical practice of declining to read ambiguous statutes to limit
its certiorari jurisdiction, which even the dissent acknowl-
edges. See post, at 15–16.
   The dissent also argues that this clear-indication require-
ment must be mistaken because it is not derived from prin-
ciples of constitutional avoidance. Constitutional avoid-
ance, however, is not the only possible source of a rule like
Castro’s. This Court also has required Congress to speak
clearly in other contexts when Congress wishes to do some-
thing that the Constitution allows. For example, the Court
will interpret a “procedural requirement as jurisdictional
only if Congress ‘clearly states’ that it is.” Boechler v. Com-
missioner, 596 U. S. 199, 203 (2022). In that context, “Con-
gress need not ‘incant magic words,’ but the ‘traditional
tools of statutory construction must plainly show that Con-
gress imbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional conse-
quences.’ ” Ibid. (citation omitted). Requiring this showing
is driven by the harsh consequences of finding a procedural
requirement jurisdictional, even though Congress, of
course, maintains the power to impose such consequences.
See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514–516 (2006);
Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 434–435 (2011). A
similar logic drives the clarity required here, when reading
§2255(h) as the Government and the dissent do would “close
our doors to a class of habeas petitioners.” Castro, 540
U. S., at 381.5

——————
  5 No one contends that Boechler controls this case. But see post, at 13–

14. The Boechler line of cases simply demonstrates that this Court re-
quires clarity in some contexts even absent constitutional concerns, un-
dermining any suggestion that constitutional avoidance is the only per-
missible source of Castro’s rule or other interpretative rules like it. Nor
does this line of cases stand alone. See, e.g., Morrison v. National Aus-
tralia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. 247, 255 (2010) (describing the presumption
against extraterritoriality, which requires a “clear indication of an extra-
territorial application” for a statute to reach beyond domestic affairs, as

                               2
   Section 2255(h)’s cross-reference does not provide the
clear indication required to bar this Court’s review. The
language of the cross-reference is both narrow and specific.
It says that a second or successive §2255 motion “must be
certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the ap-
propriate court of appeals to contain” one of two threshold
content requirements. (The text of the cross-reference does
not end at “ ‘certified as provided in section 2244,’ ” as the
dissent would have it. See post, at 5, 8, 10–11.) The cross-
reference thus appears to incorporate only the provisions in
§2244 that “provid[e]” for how a “panel of the appropriate
court of appeals” “certifie[s]” a second or successive filing
and directs that those procedures be used to evaluate
whether the filing “contain[s]” the content requirements
listed in §2255(h). Section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not one of those
provisions, and it has nothing to do with the content re-
quirements in §2255(h).
   First, the cross-reference speaks to how a “panel” of the
court of appeals certifies a filing. But this Court is not “a
panel of the appropriate court of appeals,” §2255(h), so the
cross-reference does not speak to this Court’s jurisdiction.
   Second, this Court’s review (or lack thereof ) is not part of
how a panel certifies a second or successive filing. Section
2244(b)(3)(A) identifies that the filing must be certified in
the court of appeals before an individual can proceed in the
district court. Section 2244(b)(3)(B) requires that a three-
judge panel make the certification decision. Section
2244(b)(3)(C) tells the panel that the filing must make a
prima facie showing that it satisfies the relevant gatekeep-
ing requirements. Finally, §2244(b)(3)(D) instructs the
panel to decide whether to certify a filing within 30 days of
receiving the request. These provisions all describe the

gress’s power to legislate”).

                           Opinion of the Court

procedures that a panel must follow in certifying a second
or successive filing, and are therefore incorporated by
§2255(h)’s cross-reference.
   In stark contrast, the certiorari bar in §2244(b)(3)(E) says
nothing about how the §2255 motion must be certified. It
instead speaks to what happens after a panel has acted on
a certification request: specifically, whether an individual
can appeal the panel’s certification decision. If the certio-
rari bar did not exist, no aspect of how the panel certifies a
filing would change.6 Put simply, “the certiorari bar ad-
dresses an entirely different act (filing a certiorari petition,
not certifying a successive motion) by an entirely different
actor (the prisoner, not the panel) in an entirely different
court (this Court, not the court of appeals).” Brief for Peti-
tioner 33. If Congress intended §2255(h) to incorporate this
postcertification orange alongside all the panel-certification
apples in §2244(b)(3), it did not say so clearly.
   Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,
barring appeals of certification decisions has an effect on
the panel’s decision by making it conclusive. Brief for
United States 47; post, at 9–10. That effect, however, has
little to do with how the “motion [is] certified . . . by a
panel.” §2255(h). Section 2255(h)’s reference to how the
“motion must be certified” under §2244 thus does not incor-
porate §2244(b)(3)(E)’s postcertification bar in the clear
manner that Castro requires.
   Contrary to the dissent’s framing, Hohn v. United States,
524 U. S. 236 (1998), does not support a different conclu-
sion. That case concerned whether the Court had jurisdic-
tion over a decision by a three-judge panel to deny a pris-
oner a certificate of appealability under §2253(c), and held
that the Court does have such jurisdiction. Id., at 253.
——————
  6 The dissent asks “[w]hat would be the point” of subparagraph (B)

without the certiorari bar in subparagraph (E). Post, at 9. The point of
(B) is still apparent. It identifies who makes the authorization determi-
nation in the first instance: a “three-judge panel of the court of appeals.”
14                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

Section 2253(c) applies to federal and state prisoners and
dictates that, before an individual can appeal from a district
court’s denial of a habeas petition, he must secure permis-
sion from “a circuit justice or judge.”
   Court-appointed amicus in Hohn argued that the decision
denying permission was not a “case” in the Court of Appeals
for the purposes of this Court’s jurisdiction under §1254(1).
The Court rejected that construction, however, in part be-
cause it would have rendered §2244(b)(3)(E) (which the
Court suggested was a requirement for “state prisoners fil-
ing second or successive habeas applications under §2254”)
as superfluous. See 524 U. S., at 249. That was because all
the reasons amicus gave for why a decision denying a cer-
tificate of appealability did not constitute a “case” for the
purposes of §1254(1) would equally have applied to a deci-
sion denying authorization to bring a second or successive
filing. Ibid. The Court nowhere held that §2244(b)(3)(E)
applied to federal prisoners. (That is not surprising because
the case did not present that question.) Nor does the
Court’s holding today render §2244(b)(3)(E) superfluous: As
all agree, it bars this Court’s review of panel authorization
decisions concerning motions to file second or successive ap-
plications by state prisoners.
   The dissent also relies on Hohn to argue that it already
stands for the proposition that §2244(B)(3)(E) imposes “a
‘clear limit’ on our jurisdiction” in this case. Post, at 7, 11–
12; see also post, at 15. Not so. No one disputes that the
certiorari bar clearly deprives the Court of jurisdiction over
classes of cases to which it applies. See Hohn, 524 U. S., at
250. What is not clear is whether, through the cross-refer-
ence in §2255(h), Congress intended for that bar to extend
to federal prisoners—a point Hohn simply did not address.
                            B
  For these reasons, whether §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar
falls within the scope of §2255(h)’s cross-reference is at

                      Opinion of the Court

most ambiguous. Ambiguous language, however, cannot
provide the required clear indication, and the Government’s
and the dissent’s remaining arguments do not supply the
necessary clarity that the text lacks.
   To begin, the Government contends that there is textual
support in §2244(b)(3)(E) for the understanding that the
certiorari bar applies to federal prisoners through the cross-
reference. On this score, the Government points to how
§§2244(b)(3)(A)–(E) each use the term “second or successive
application” instead of referring to §2254 specifically or
state prisoners more generally. This stands in contrast to
nearly all the other provisions in §2244. In the Govern-
ment’s view, this textual variation means that Congress in-
tended for §2255(h)’s cross-reference to incorporate any pro-
vision in §2244 that uses the term “second or successive
application” and the breadth of the cross-reference there-
fore must be understood on those terms.
   If that were so, §2255(h)’s cross-reference would also in-
corporate §2244(b)(4). That provision directs district courts
to review and “dismiss any claim presented in a second or
successive application that the court of appeals has author-
ized . . . unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies
the requirements of ” §2244. Put differently, once a second
or successive application is certified, §2244(b)(4) tells a dis-
trict court to doublecheck that the application satisfies
§2244, including its gatekeeping requirements. Section
2244(b)(4), however, plainly falls outside the scope of
§2255(h)’s cross-reference because §2244(b)(4) has nothing
to do with how a filing is “certified as provided in section
2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals.”
§2255(h). Thus, accepting the Government’s argument that
§2255(h)’s cross-reference should be understood to incorpo-
rate any provision in §2244 that uses “second or successive
application” would essentially require interpreting
§2255(h) to mean a federal prisoner’s second or successive
motion “must conform to all provisions in section 2244 that
16                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

are not expressly limited to state prisoners.” That, of
course, is not what §2255(h) says.
   The Government also points to part of §2244(b)(3)(E) that
does speak to a “panel” of “a court of appeals.” Specifically,
§2244(b)(3)(E) says that an authorization decision “shall
not be the subject of a petition for rehearing,” thereby bar-
ring panel rehearing. According to the Government, be-
cause §2244(b)(3)(E) speaks to the panel in some regard,
§2255(h) must have intended to incorporate that provision
in its entirety. The Government is wrong, however, that
the certiorari bar is incorporated in this way. Whether
§2244(b)(3)(E)’s panel-rehearing bar applies to federal pris-
oners says little, and certainly nothing clear, about whether
Congress intended §2244(b)(3)(E)’s separate certiorari bar
to extend to authorization decisions concerning federal pris-
oners. Using the former to incorporate the latter is the kind
of jurisdiction stripping by implication that cannot suffice.
Cf. Felker, 518 U. S., at 660 (“Repeals [of jurisdiction] by
implication are not favored”).
   Next, the Government and the dissent argue that allow-
ing appeals from a panel’s certification decision to this
Court is inconsistent with §2244(b)(3)(D). Post, at 20; Brief
for United States 27–28. That provision, which all agree is
covered by §2255(h)’s cross-reference, imposes a 30-day
clock on a panel’s certification decision after a litigant seeks
authorization (though most Courts of Appeals view that re-
quirement as advisory, see In re Williams, 898 F. 3d 1098,
1102, n. 5 (CA11 2018) (Wilson, J., specially concurring)
(collecting cases); see also infra, at 23–24, and n. 8). When
an individual seeks certiorari, on the other hand, he has 90
days from the date of decision to file a petition in this Court.
This Court’s Rule 13.1. The Government suggests that the
30-day limit for panel review indicates that Congress
wanted the certification decision to occur quickly, and that
allowing prisoners to seek certiorari for an additional 90
                      Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                      17

                           Opinion of the Court

days after the panel review concludes would thwart that in-
tention.
   The Government’s argument is misguided. Nothing
about      the    Court’s    decision   today    undermines
§2244(b)(3)(D)’s timeline for the panel’s authorization deci-
sion. Nor is this inference so compelling as to provide the
needed clarity to cut off the Court’s jurisdiction: It is en-
tirely plausible that Congress intended to require panels to
move quickly, while still preserving the prisoner’s ability to
seek further review in the rare case that warrants this
Court’s attention. See §2266 (placing time limits on the in-
itial review of capital cases in the lower courts but placing
no limits on this Court’s review). Panels will still have the
tools needed, moreover, to facilitate that quick review un-
der the Court’s interpretation of §2255(h)’s cross-reference.
See infra, at 23–24, and n. 8.7
   From here, the Government resorts to another structural
argument. The certiorari bar is found in §2244(b)(3)’s fifth
subparagraph. Everyone agrees that §2255(h)’s cross-
reference incorporates the preceding four subparagraphs.
The Government maintains that it would be odd that Con-
gress intended to incorporate four of those subparagraphs
and not all five. Brief for United States 17, 23. If Congress
had intended for all five to travel together, however, it did
not say so explicitly. That would have been easy to do: Con-
gress simply could have referenced §2244(b)(3) specifically,
rather than broadly referencing §2244 with a narrow cross-
reference only specifying how a second or successive filing
is “certified” by a “panel.” Congress did not. The language
——————
  7 Nor does the Court’s decision today risk unduly opening the flood-

gates to frivolous appeals from authorization decisions concerning fed-
eral prisoners. Such appeals will be governed by the ordinary rules that
prevent abuses of the Court’s certiorari docket in every other circum-
stance. See, e.g., this Court’s Rules 39.8, 42.2. If Congress thought it
best to strip the Court of jurisdiction to keep these appeals away from
the Court’s docket nonetheless, it failed to convey that intent sufficiently.

                      Opinion of the Court

it used instead supports the understanding that the provi-
sions the cross-reference incorporates turn on their sub-
stance, not where they sit in a list. As explained, supra, at
12–14, the certiorari bar does not clearly fall within the
scope of the cross-reference on its own terms.
   Finally, the Government invokes a practical concern.
The Government suggests that it would make little sense to
bar certiorari review of authorization decisions concerning
state prisoners but not federal ones. That argument carries
little weight when the governing standard requires Con-
gress to speak clearly. It also misses the mark. Congress
treated state and federal prisoners differently across
AEDPA, with state prisoners often facing far higher hur-
dles to relief. To name a few examples: The statutory re-
quirements for second or successive filings for federal and
state prisoners are “not identical.” Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545
U. S. 524, 529, n. 3 (2005); compare §§2244(b)(1)–(2) with
§§2255(h)(1)–(2). Indeed, the requirements for federal pris-
oners are more lenient, as explained in detail below. See
infra, at 21–22. Further, for state prisoners alone, Con-
gress requires exhaustion, §§2254(b)–(c), and then, once in
federal court, mandates deference to both the state court’s
application of federal law and its factual determinations,
§2254(d).
   This differential treatment exists for good reason. Con-
gress enacted AEDPA “to further the principles of comity,
finality, and federalism.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,
436 (2000). The Act “recognizes a foundational principle of
our federal system: State courts are adequate forums for
the vindication of federal rights.” Burt v. Titlow, 571 U. S.
12, 19 (2013). Out of respect for state courts and their abil-
ity “to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong, AEDPA
erect[ed] a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for
[state] prisoners.” Ibid. Federal courts “will not lightly con-
clude that a State’s criminal justice system has experienced
the ‘extreme malfunctio[n]’ for which federal habeas relief
                  Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)            19

                      Opinion of the Court

is the remedy.” Id., at 20; see also Greene v. Fisher, 565
U. S. 34, 38 (2011) (observing that “the purpose of AEDPA
is to ensure that federal habeas” review of state-court pro-
ceedings does not function as a “means of error correction”).
   Comity and federalism, however, fall away when a fed-
eral court reviews a federal judgment. By the time a federal
prisoner looks to file a second or successive motion, moreo-
ver, he will have had fewer bites at the apple, and fewer
courts reviewing his case, than most state prisoners in the
same position. See §2254(b)(1)(A); In re Graham, 61 F. 4th
433, 441 (CA4 2023). Although the Federal Government
has an interest in finality too, Mayle v. Felix, 545 U. S. 644,
662 (2005), “ ‘[n]o legislation pursues its purposes at all
costs,’ ” Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. 449,
460 (2012). Allowing further review in this Court is thus
consistent with both AEDPA’s purposes and practical con-
siderations.
   At bottom, the Government’s arguments suggest that
§2255(h)’s cross-reference might include §2244(b)(3)(E)’s
certiorari bar. They do not, however, provide the necessary
“clear indication” that Congress intended to “close our doors
to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review.” Castro, 540
U. S., at 381. Absent such clear indication, federal prison-
ers are not prohibited from seeking certiorari from a panel’s
denial of authorization to file a second or successive motion.
                              III
  Turning now to the merits upon which the Court granted
certiorari, Bowe and the Government agree that the Elev-
enth Circuit erred by applying §2244(b)(1) to Bowe’s re-
quest for authorization to file a second or successive motion
to vacate under §2255(h). The Court appointed Kasdin M.
Mitchell as amicus curiae to argue in support of the Elev-
enth Circuit’s position. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). She has ably
discharged her responsibilities. The Court nevertheless
agrees with the parties and holds that §2244(b)(1) does not
20                BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     Opinion of the Court

apply to motions filed by federal prisoners under §2255(h).
The contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.
                              A
   Begin with the text. Section 2244(b)(1) states that “[a]
claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus ap-
plication under section 2254 that was presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed.” State prisoners alone file
habeas corpus applications under §2254. See §2254(a) (not-
ing that §2254 is limited to “a person in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court”); see also Magwood v. Pat-
terson, 561 U. S. 320, 333 (2010) (“The requirement of cus-
tody pursuant to a state court-judgment distinguishes §2254
from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from con-
stitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows chal-
lenges to the judgments of federal courts”).
   This specific reference to §2254 was deliberate: Else-
where in this very section, §2244 acknowledges §2255. See
§2244(a) (referencing §2255); see also §§2253(c)(1)(A)–(B)
(distinguishing a “final order” in a “habeas corpus proceed-
ing in which the detention complained of arises out of pro-
cess issued by a State court” from one “in a proceeding un-
der section 2255”); §2266(a) (distinguishing an “application
under section 2254” from a “motion under section 2255”). A
cardinal rule of statutory interpretation teaches that “when
we’re engaged in the business of interpreting statutes[,] we
presume differences in language like this convey differ-
ences in meaning.” Henson v. Santander Consumer USA
Inc., 582 U. S. 79, 86 (2017). Thus, by its plain terms,
§2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar applies only to state prisoners.
   Nor does §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 otherwise
make §2244(b)(1) applicable to second or successive motions
filed by federal prisoners. Amicus, as well as the dissent,
however, argues that it does. As they see it, §2255(h) incor-
porates §2244, including §2244(b)(3)(C).              Section
2244(b)(3)(C), in turn, requires a panel to determine that
                  Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)            21

                      Opinion of the Court

“the application makes a prima facie showing that [it] sat-
isfies the requirements of this subsection.” From here, one
of the “requirements of . . . subsection” (b) is §2244(b)(1).
Following this chain of cross-references where it leads, ami-
cus and the dissent say, §2244(b)(1) must apply to federal
prisoners.
   The reasoning why this Court has jurisdiction also shows
the error in this position. See supra, at 12–14. Section
2255(h)’s cross-reference incorporates the procedures in
§2244 only as they relate to how a panel certifies a second
or successive filing. It then tells the panel to use those pro-
cedures to evaluate whether the federal prisoner’s second
or successive motion “contain[s]” either newly discovered
evidence, §2255(h)(1), or a new rule of constitutional law,
§2255(h)(2). Nothing in §2255(h) suggests that it incorpo-
rates §2244 for any other purposes. Thus, by its terms,
§2255(h)’s cross-reference does not incorporate the content
requirements contained in §2244, like §2244(b)(1)’s old-
claim bar.
   Amicus and the dissent’s broad reading of §2244(b)(3)(C)
would also put §2255 on a collision course with §2244. Sec-
tion 2244(b) imposes two limitations on the content of a sec-
ond or successive habeas application: §2244(b)(1), which
bars old claims; and §2244(b)(2), which prescribes “two
grounds” in which a claim “not previously raised” can pro-
ceed in a “second or successive application.” Burton, 549
U. S., at 153. Section 2244(b)(3)(C), on which amicus relies,
requires individuals to satisfy all the “requirements of this
subsection,” including both §§2244(b)(1) and (b)(2). The up-
shot of amicus’s argument would therefore be that §2255(h)
incorporates not only §2244(b)(1)’s old-claim bar, but also
§2244(b)(2)’s substantive gatekeeping requirements for
new claims. Section 2255(h), however, contains its own
substantive requirements that are irreconcilable with those
in §2244(b).
22                BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                      Opinion of the Court

   In particular, §2255(h)(1) permits a second or successive
§2255 motion if the petitioner identifies “newly discovered
evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence
as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and con-
vincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have
found the movant guilty of the offense.”               Section
2244(b)(2)(B) also concerns claims based on new facts, but
it is more limited than §2255’s in two ways. First, it con-
fines the new-facts exception to scenarios in which the new
facts “could not have been discovered previously through
the exercise of due diligence.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(i). Second, it
requires that the movant show “by clear and convincing ev-
idence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-
finder would have found the applicant guilty of the under-
lying offense.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).
   If Congress had incorporated §2244(b)(2)(B)’s more strin-
gent exception into §2255(h), then §2255(h)(1)’s more leni-
ent exception would become a dead letter. Because “ ‘Con-
gress presumably does not enact useless laws,’ ” Garland v.
Cargill, 602 U. S. 406, 427 (2024), it makes no sense to read
§2255(h)’s cross-reference in this way.
   Recognizing the problem with this position, amicus and
the dissent attempt to limit the scope of “requirements of
this subsection” in §2244(B)(3)(C) to capture only those con-
tent requirements in §§2244(b)(1) and (b)(2) that do not con-
flict with §2255(h). In their view, Congress intended for the
substantive gatekeeping requirements in §2244(b) to apply
to federal prisoners by default, unless they deviated from
those requirements in §2255(h). To amicus, the new-facts
exception illustrates this approach. This argument, how-
ever, is undercut by the fact that in §2244(b)(2)(A) and
§2255(h)(2), Congress repeated verbatim the standard for
when a second or successive filing can proceed based on a
new, retroactive rule of constitutional law. If §2244(b)(2)(A)
already provided the default rule, there would have been no
need for Congress to repeat it in §2255(h)(2), rendering its
                     Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                    23

                          Opinion of the Court

inclusion mere surplusage. Hohn, 524 U. S., at 249 (declin-
ing “to adopt a construction making another statutory pro-
vision superfluous”).
  At bottom, the best textual reading of both §2255(h) and
§2244(b) is that, when a federal prisoner moves for author-
ization, a panel can authorize the filing if it satisfies one of
the two grounds in §2255(h), the “two—and only two—con-
ditions in which a second or successive §2255 motion may
proceed.” Jones, 599 U. S., at 477.
                               B
   Amicus’s remaining nontextual arguments do not change
this conclusion. She contends that §2244(b)(1) is a neces-
sary tool, indeed “central,” for panels to meet
§2244(b)(3)(D)’s 30-day deadline, and that Congress there-
fore must have intended for it to apply in all cases in which
authorization is needed. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus
Curiae 12, 23–26. That logical leap lacks sufficient founda-
tion.
   For one, it is not clear why searching through case files
to see if the litigant has raised a claim before is any easier
than determining whether the litigant has identified new
evidence or a new rule of constitutional law that is retroac-
tive. As the parties explain, it seems just as likely that the
panel’s obligation to assess only whether a filing has made
a prima facie showing that it satisfies §2255(h)’s content re-
quirements, and not to undertake a more searching inquiry
on the merits, is what facilitates the 30-day deadline. See
Reply Brief for Petitioner 9–10; Reply Brief for United
States 9; see also Tyler v. Cain, 533 U. S. 656, 664, 661, n. 3
(2001). Amicus certainly provides no evidence to suggest
that her hypothesis is the more plausible one.8 Regardless,
——————
  8 For support, amicus relies on the fact that the three Circuits that do

not apply §2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners do not consider the 30-day
deadline binding, suggesting that the failure to apply §2244(b)(1)’s old-
claim bar is the reason for their failure to comply with the 30-day
24                     BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                           Opinion of the Court

amicus’s “speculation as to Congress’ intent” in enacting
the old-claim bar and 30-day deadline “cannot replace the
actual text” Congress enacted. Magwood, 561 U. S., at 334.
   Amicus further argues that Congress meant for AEDPA
to treat second or successive filings by federal and state
prisoners the same. As already explained, however,
AEDPA is replete with examples of Congress treating state
and federal prisoners differently—including in the context
of limitations on second or successive filings. Supra, at 18–
19.9
   Some courts, including the Eleventh Circuit below, have
relied on this policy justification and others like it in apply-
ing §2244(b)(1) to bar second or successive motions filed by
federal prisoners under §2255(h). See, e.g., In re Baptiste,
828 F. 3d 1337, 1339 (2016) (“[I]t would be odd indeed if
Congress had intended to allow federal prisoners to refile
precisely the same non-meritorious motions over and over
again while denying that right to state prisoners”). Those
courts erred: “[P]urposive argument simply cannot over-
come the force of the plain text.” Mohamad, 566 U. S., at
460. Any concern associated with Congress allowing old-
claim repeat litigation for federal prisoners, moreover, is
overstated: All claims, even the repeat ones, must meet the
——————
deadline in all cases. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 24–25.
Amicus overlooks, however, that three out of the six Circuits that apply
§2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners also do not treat that deadline as bind-
ing. Compare In re Williams, 898 F. 3d 1098, 1102, n. 5 (CA11 2018)
(Wilson, J., specially concurring) (noting that the Second, Third, and Sev-
enth Circuits do not treat the 30-day deadline as binding, and that the
Eighth Circuit has not yet “opined on the issue”), with supra, at 5, n. 1
(collecting those Circuits on the side of the Circuit split applying
§2244(b)(1) to federal prisoners).
   9 This is not the only way in which Congress has treated old claims filed

by federal and state prisoners differently. Section 2244(c) bars state pris-
oners from raising a claim or challenging facts in the federal postconvic-
tion setting that were adjudicated by this Court on direct review. This
bar does not apply to federal prisoners, even though this Court can also
exercise jurisdiction over appeals on direct review of federal convictions.

                          Opinion of the Court

“strictly limited” threshold requirements of §2255(h),
Jones, 599 U. S., at 476, and should they survive that re-
view, they must still conform with the demanding statute
of limitations contained in §2255(f ), Dodd v. United States,
545 U. S. 353, 359 (2005). Very few claims will satisfy ei-
ther, let alone both. Ultimately, there is “no reason to
doubt” that “Congress said what it meant and meant what
it said” in §2244(b)(1) and §2255(h). Loughrin v. United
States, 573 U. S. 351, 360 (2014).10
                        *    *     *
  For these reasons, §2244(b)(1) does not apply to second or
successive motions filed by federal prisoners challenging
their convictions or sentences under §2255(h). The Court
leaves it to the Eleventh Circuit to determine in the first
instance whether Bowe should receive authorization to file
a second or successive motion under the correct standard.
The judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                                                       It is so ordered.




——————
   10 Although the common law did not apply traditional res judicata prin-

ciples to habeas petitions, courts developed different equitable doctrines
to address abuses of the writ. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 479–
489 (1991). Congress can displace those doctrines, but in the absence of
evidence of that intent, federal courts can continue to use those common-
law tools. Cf. Banister v. Davis, 590 U. S. 504, 515 (2020) (concluding
that AEDPA did not displace the historical practice of applying Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) in habeas). Section 2244(b) codified a “mod-
ified res judicata rule” for second or successive petitions. Felker v. Tur-
pin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996). As the Government argues here, AEDPA
may not have displaced other practices that courts can still use to ad-
dress repetitive filings made by federal prisoners in the absence of
§2244(b)(1). See Brief for United States 48–50.

  MICHAEL BOWE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                        [January 9, 2026]

   JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring.
   I agree with the Court that, under our precedents, Con-
gress was required to say more if it wanted 28 U. S. C.
§2244(b)(3)(E) to strip our jurisdiction over federal prison-
ers’ requests for review of panel-certification decisions. See
ante, at 10. I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion
that §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims in second or succes-
sive applications applies only to state prisoners. See ante,
at 20–21. I write separately to offer my view of what Con-
gress likely sought to accomplish with §2244(b)(3)(E): insu-
lating a three-judge panel’s properly made (even if errone-
ous) gatekeeping determination from further review. The
provision’s language, our decision in Castro v. United
States, 540 U. S. 375, 381 (2003), and the broader statute’s
detailed gatekeeping scheme all support this interpreta-
tion. Because the three-judge panel here did not deny
Bowe’s petition pursuant to the statutorily prescribed pro-
cedures, I think it did not make the sort of determination
Congress intended to insulate.
                               I
   Section 2244(b)(3)(E) provides that “[t]he grant or denial
of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or
successive application shall not be appealable and shall not
be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of cer-
tiorari.” This provision thus prevents our Court from
2                      BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                         JACKSON, J., concurring

reviewing a certiorari petition whose “subject” is the “grant”
or “denial” of a request for “authorization . . . to file a second
or successive application.” That proscription does not cover
Bowe’s petition.
   In its decision below, the Court of Appeals did not grant
or deny Bowe authorization to proceed on his successive
claim. Rather, it “dismissed” his proposed claim “for lack of
jurisdiction.” In re Bowe, Civ. No. 24–11704 (CA11, June
27, 2024), App. 79. True, “the label attached to an order”
does not erase its “practical effect.” Abbott v. Perez, 585
U. S. 579, 594 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also post, at 17, n. 4 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). But, in
this case, the distinction between a denial and a dismissal
is practical, not semantic.
   As I read §2244(b)(3)(E), a “grant or denial” occurs when
a three-judge panel goes through the screening procedures
Congress has prescribed and applies the appropriate crite-
ria for second or successive claims.1 Here, the three-judge
panel never actually applied the relevant criteria to Bowe’s
motion—that is, the criteria for federal prisoners under
§§2255(h)(1) and (h)(2). Instead, the panel reflexively dis-
missed Bowe’s authorization request, holding that
§2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims deprived it of jurisdic-
tion, even though §2244(b)(1) applies only to state prison-
ers, for the reasons the Court explains. Ante, at 23.
   As a result, a three-judge panel never undertook the re-
quired process for evaluating—i.e., for granting or deny-
ing—Bowe’s authorization request.             Put differently,
——————
  1 Today’s dispute encompasses a disagreement about which set of stat-

utory criteria applies to federal prisoners: §2244(b)(1) or §2255(h). Ac-
cording to JUSTICE GORSUCH, “[e]veryone agrees” that §2244(b)(3)(E)
“precludes us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction to review an appel-
late panel’s decision granting or denying certification to state prisoners.”
Post, at 3 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added). I agree with that as-
sertion, but, as I will explain, only insofar as it refers to appellate-panel
decisions that actually apply the statutory criteria and specified proce-
dures for granting or denying state prisoners’ authorization requests.

because the panel dismissed Bowe’s petition, there was no
“grant or denial” of his “authorization” request that could
be challenged in a petition for certiorari, as §2244(b)(3)(E)
requires.
   This reading of §2244(b)(3)(E) finds support in Castro.
That case, like this one, came to us in a distinct posture.
Castro, a federal prisoner, filed a motion in the District
Court to vacate his sentence under §2255. See 540 U. S., at
378. Because Castro did not understand his motion to be
second or successive, he did not first seek authorization
from a three-judge panel in the Court of Appeals. See id.,
at 378–379; see also 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(3)(A) (“Before a
second or successive application . . . is filed in the district
court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of
appeals for an order authorizing the district court to con-
sider the application”). Taking a different view than Cas-
tro, the District Court “dismissed the motion for failure to
comply with” the statutory restrictions on second or succes-
sive claims. 540 U. S., at 379. On appeal, the Eleventh Cir-
cuit agreed with the District Court’s analysis and affirmed
without evaluating Castro’s motion on the merits. Castro
subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, seeking
to challenge the Eleventh Circuit’s second or successive de-
termination. But the Government contended that we
lacked jurisdiction under §2244(b)(3)(E). See id., at 379–
380.
   We ultimately held that §2244(b)(3)(E) did not bar our re-
view of Castro’s petition. In so holding, we emphasized that
Castro had not “asked the Court of Appeals to grant, and it
nowhere denied, any ‘authorization . . . to file a second or
successive application.’ ”         Id., at 380 (quoting
§2244(b)(3)(E)). Instead, the case came to the Eleventh Cir-
cuit on appeal, after the District Court had already made
its own determination about the viability of Castro’s mo-
tion. In that posture, we explained, the Eleventh Circuit
had not made a “statutorily relevant ‘denial’ of a request”
4                      BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                          JACKSON, J., concurring

for authorization—even though the court’s conclusion “had
the effect of denying ‘authorization’ ” to Castro. Id., at 380.
Against that procedural background, the “ ‘subject’ ” of Cas-
tro’s certiorari petition was “not the Court of Appeals’ ‘de-
nial of an authorization,’ ” so we retained our jurisdiction
despite §2244(b)(3)(E). Ibid.
  So too here. To be sure, unlike Castro, Bowe’s case has
moved through the initial procedure for second or succes-
sive motions—that is, Bowe comes to us after first request-
ing authorization from a three-judge panel in the Court of
Appeals. But, just like Castro, the three-judge panel never
made a “statutorily relevant” denial of Bowe’s authorization
request. To do so, the panel would have had to go through
the applicable statutory criteria and determine whether
Bowe’s successive motion satisfied the conditions of
§§2255(h)(1) and (h)(2). Because the panel never made such
a determination, it neither granted nor denied Bowe’s au-
thorization request, as required to bar our review under
§2244(b)(3)(E).2


——————
   2 Because Castro’s analysis calls for a “statutorily relevant” denial, 540

U. S., at 380, it lays bare JUSTICE GORSUCH’s mistaken contention that
“[a] denial is a denial” for §2244(b)(3)(E) purposes, post, at 17, n. 4. Read-
ing the statute as I do also resolves the purported tension in the Court’s
opinion that JUSTICE GORSUCH elsewhere identifies: Why would the
Court “take the trouble to show” that Castro, a federal prisoner, “wasn’t
pursuing a second or successive attack subject to subparagraph (E)” if
that provision had “no bearing whatsoever on federal prisoners in the
first place?” Post, at 7. The answer, of course, is that the Court had no
need to resolve subparagraph (E)’s application to all federal prisoners
when the provision so clearly did not apply to Castro. In other words,
the Court left open the question whether subparagraph (E) prevented
our review of a certiorari petition whose “ ‘subject’ ” actually is a “statu-
torily relevant ‘denial’ of a request” for authorization to file a successive
claim under 28 U. S. C. §2255. 540 U. S., at 380. I agree with today’s
conclusion that subparagraph (E) does not prevent our review under
those circumstances. This separate writing observes only that Castro’s
logic likewise authorizes our review of Bowe’s petition.

   One might reasonably question why Congress would have
crafted §2244(b)(3)(E) to achieve such a technical distinc-
tion: barring further review of denials on the merits while
permitting further review of the panel’s use of the wrong
criteria or procedures. As JUSTICE GORSUCH points out, the
effect is the same; either way, the prisoner may not file his
second or successive motion. Post, at 17, n. 4. But in my
view, the distinction is not a technical (or meaningless) one.
Instead, it fits neatly within, and advances, the gatekeep-
ing scheme Congress established.
   For evidence, look no further than §2244(b)(3)’s other
subparagraphs, which set forth a multipart gatekeeping
process for second or successive claims. First, a prisoner
“move[s] in the appropriate court of appeals for an order
authorizing” a second or successive claim. §2244(b)(3)(A).
Second, “a three-judge panel” considers the request for au-
thorization. §2244(b)(3)(B). Third, the panel “determines”
whether the prisoner has made “a prima facie showing” of
satisfying the relevant statutory “requirements.”
§2244(b)(3)(C). Fourth, the panel issues its determination
in no more than “30 days.” §2244(b)(3)(D).
   With §2244(b)(3), Congress plainly erected a specific
screening process for second or successive petitions. And
with subparagraph (E), in particular, Congress afforded
that process finality—but only if the prescribed procedures
have been properly followed.
   By contrast, consider a panel that completely ignores the
statute’s specified gatekeeping requirements when making
the authorization determination. Maybe the panel consists
of five judges instead of three. Or maybe the panel auto-
matically and arbitrarily denies all requests for authoriza-
tion, refusing to evaluate whether the prisoner has satisfied
the relevant statutory criteria. It would be exceedingly
strange for us to conclude that Congress meant to insulate
a rogue panel’s actions from further review. Indeed, why
6                  BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     JACKSON, J., concurring

would Congress devise such a detailed gatekeeping scheme
while foreclosing review of its evasion?
   At bottom, then, §2244(b)(3)(E) rationally operates as a
finality provision, designed to give a three-judge panel the
last say when the panel properly performs its gatekeeping
function. But when the panel goes through the wrong pro-
cedures (as it did in Castro) or applies the wrong criteria (as
it did here), it has not made the requisite “grant or denial
of an authorization” that §2244(b)(3)(E) insulates from fur-
ther review.
   For that reason, in my view, even if Congress had spoken
more clearly about §2244(b)(3)(E)’s application to federal
prisoners, the panel’s mistaken dismissal—instead of de-
nial—of Bowe’s petition makes §2244(b)(3)(E) patently in-
applicable.

 MICHAEL BOWE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                        [January 9, 2026]

   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, and with whom JUSTICE BARRETT joins
as to Part I, dissenting.
   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996 (AEDPA), courts of appeals serve an important
gatekeeping function. When a state prisoner seeks to chal-
lenge his conviction or sentence in federal court for the first
time, he normally proceeds directly to district court under
28 U. S. C. §2254. But before a state prisoner may bring a
second or successive attack in district court, AEDPA re-
quires him to obtain a certificate from a panel of the rele-
vant federal court of appeals. And under §2244, an appel-
late panel may certify a case to proceed only subject to
certain demanding rules.
   Two are relevant here. First, an appellate panel may not
authorize do-over claims—claims the prisoner already “pre-
sented in a prior” federal challenge. §2244(b)(1). Second,
neither a state prisoner nor state authorities may file a pe-
tition for rehearing or seek “a writ of certiorari” to contest
an appellate panel’s decision granting or denying certifica-
tion. §2244(b)(3)(E).
   AEDPA contains parallel directions for federal prisoners.
When a federal prisoner seeks to challenge his conviction or
sentence collaterally for the first time, he usually proceeds
directly to district court under §2255. But before he can
pursue a second or successive challenge, it “must be
2                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the ap-
propriate court of appeals.” §2255(h). Through that cross-
reference, then, federal prisoners seeking to bring second or
successive collateral attacks are generally subject to the
same rules as their state counterparts.
   That brings us to Michael Bowe. After shooting two
guards while trying to rob an armored vehicle in 2008, he
pleaded guilty to three federal crimes. Since then, he has
pursued five nearly identical postconviction challenges. In
each, Mr. Bowe has asserted that one of the statutes under
which he was convicted, 18 U. S. C. §924(c), is unconstitu-
tional under our void-for-vagueness doctrine. And in all but
the first of his challenges, Mr. Bowe has centered his argu-
ment around the same case: United States v. Davis, 588
U. S. 445 (2019).
   When Mr. Bowe sought permission to bring his latest col-
lateral attack, the Eleventh Circuit demurred. Because he
had pursued his Davis claim three times before, the court
held that his latest filing represented an impermissible do-
over claim barred by §2244(b)(1). Now, Mr. Bowe asks us
to reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s decision. Yes, he concedes,
AEDPA bars state prisoners from pursuing do-over claims.
But, he insists, federal prisoners are different. They (and
they alone) are free to bring the same claim in district court
over and over again.
   Before we can take up that question, however, we must
answer another. Under §2244(b)(3)(E), Mr. Bowe acknowl-
edges, this Court lacks certiorari jurisdiction to review an
appellate panel’s decision denying a state prisoner leave to
file a second or successive collateral challenge. But here
again, Mr. Bowe argues federal prisoners are different. He
submits that they (and, once more, they alone) are free to
challenge adverse certification decisions on writ of certio-
rari.

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

  Because I do not believe that either of Mr. Bowe’s pleas
for federal-prisoner exceptionalism can be squared with
AEDPA’s text, I respectfully dissent.
                                 I
   I understand my colleagues’ eagerness to reach the mer-
its of this case. As they observe, the courts of appeals are
divided on the question whether federal prisoners like Mr.
Bowe may pursue do-over claims. Ante, at 5. Doubtless,
too, it is often this Court’s job to resolve circuit splits and
bring nationwide uniformity to the application of federal
law.
   But it is also one of our paramount responsibilities to re-
spect the limits on our jurisdiction. And, to my eyes,
AEDPA precludes us from exercising certiorari jurisdiction
here. Section 2244 instructs that “the grant or denial of an
authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or suc-
cessive” collateral attack “shall not be the subject of a peti-
tion . . . for a writ of certiorari.” §2244(b)(3)(E). Everyone
agrees this provision precludes us from exercising certiorari
jurisdiction to review an appellate panel’s decision granting
or denying certification to state prisoners. And because
§2255(h) tells us that the same rules apply to federal pris-
oners, exactly the same outcome follows for federal prison-
ers like Mr. Bowe.
   Importantly, though, that does not mean we lack for ways
to resolve the circuit split my colleagues worry over.
AEDPA may prevent us from exercising certiorari jurisdic-
tion under §1254(1). But AEDPA not only leaves untouched
our power to entertain original habeas petitions filed di-
rectly in this Court. Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660–
661 (1996). AEDPA also leaves untouched our power to ac-
cept certified “question[s] of law” from the federal courts of
appeals and provide them with “binding instructions” on
how to answer those questions under §1254(2), a provision
4                  BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

found right next door to the one governing our certiorari ju-
risdiction.
   Accustomed as we are to proceeding by way of certiorari
under §1254(1), it’s true that we have rarely accepted certi-
fied questions under §1254(2). But a rare procedure befits
rare circumstances. And this case involves a rare circum-
stance indeed—a circuit split that would otherwise stagger
on forever. Rather than ignore §2244’s express constraint
on our certiorari jurisdiction, then, we might have simply
signaled to the courts of appeals our willingness to accept
certification in this or a similar case. Cf. United States v.
Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 746–747 (1946) (accepting certification
in the uncommon situation of a “circuit court of appeals . . .
equally divided on” questions of law).
                               A
   To appreciate why we lack certiorari jurisdiction, it helps
to start with a bird’s eye view of how AEDPA addresses sec-
ond or successive collateral attacks.
   AEDPA seeks “to advance the finality of criminal convic-
tions.” Mayle v. Felix, 545 U. S. 644, 662 (2005). It does so,
in part, by imposing “stric[t] limit[s]” on the ability of fed-
eral and state prisoners to bring multiple postconviction at-
tacks in federal court. See Jones v. Hendrix, 599 U. S. 465,
476 (2023). So, for example, a federal prisoner’s second or
successive collateral attack “must be certified . . . to con-
tain” a showing of either new facts or new law. §2255(h).
The new-facts route requires the prisoner to show that he
possesses newly discovered evidence that, if proved, would
establish his innocence clearly and convincingly. See
§2255(h)(1). The new-law route requires him to argue that
his conviction or sentence is unlawful in light of a new rule
of constitutional law that this Court has made retroactively
                    Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                  5

                       GORSUCH, J., dissenting

applicable to cases on collateral review. See §2255(h)(2).
Similar rules apply to state prisoners under §2244(b)(2).1
  Even beyond those constraints, AEDPA imposes others.
A federal prisoner’s second or successive §2255 attack not
only must “contain” either new facts or new law; it also
“must be certified as provided in section 2244.” §2255(h).
Everyone agrees this cross-reference directs us to
§2244(b)(3). That paragraph provides these instructions:
        “(A) Before a second or successive application per-
     mitted by this section is filed in the district court, the
     applicant shall move in the appropriate court of ap-
     peals for an order authorizing the district court to con-
     sider the application.
        “(B) A motion in the court of appeals . . . shall be de-
     termined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.
        “(C) The court of appeals may authorize the filing of
     a second or successive application only if it determines
     that the application makes a prima facie showing that
     the application satisfies the requirements of this sub-
     section.
        “(D) The court of appeals shall grant or deny the au-
     thorization . . . not later than 30 days after the filing of
     the motion.
        “(E) The grant or denial of an authorization . . . shall
     not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a peti-
     tion for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.”
   With this overview in hand, our lack of certiorari juris-
diction quickly becomes clear. Section 2244(b)(3)(E) prohib-
its a state prisoner from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction
to challenge an order denying him leave to file a second or
successive collateral attack. Indeed, this Court has already
held as much. Felker, 518 U. S., at 658–659. And §2255(h)
——————
  1 Put aside for the moment AEDPA’s additional instructions about do-

over claims—they become relevant only when we come to the merits. See
Part II, infra.
6                  BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

tells us that a federal prisoner seeking to pursue a second
or successive collateral attack must obtain certification “as
provided in section 2244” for state prisoners. Accordingly,
the same bar on certiorari applies.
   That commonsense conclusion finds unanimous support
in the courts of appeals. Just as §2244(b)(3)(E) bars certio-
rari petitions, it also bars petitions for panel or en banc re-
hearing. Since AEDPA’s adoption in 1996, a great many
federal prisoners have sought rehearing on the theory that
this rule applies only to state prisoners, not them. Yet
every circuit to consider that approach has rejected it, rec-
ognizing instead that subparagraph (E) applies to federal
prisoners no less than their state counterparts, and thus
prohibits them from petitioning for panel or en banc rehear-
ing. See, e.g., In re Clark, 837 F. 3d 1080, 1082–1083 (CA10
2016) (collecting cases); In re Baptiste, 828 F. 3d 1337, 1340
(CA11 2016); Págan-San Miguel v. United States, 736 F. 3d
44, 46, n. 1 (CA1 2013) (per curiam); In re Sonshine, 132
F. 3d 1133, 1134 (CA6 1997).
   Our own precedent carries the same message. In Castro
v. United States, 540 U. S. 375 (2003), the government ar-
gued that subparagraph (E) precluded this Court from con-
sidering a federal prisoner’s challenge to an appellate panel
decision denying him leave to file a second or successive at-
tack. At the same time, the government contended, the
terms of subparagraph (E) leave it free to challenge many
appellate panel decisions granting a federal prisoner per-
mission to proceed. Id., at 380–381. The Court rejected
both submissions. First, after conducting a painstakingly
detailed analysis of the filing history of the particular pris-
oner before it, the Court concluded that his challenge was
not in fact second or successive. So subparagraph (E)—
which applies only to second or successive challenges—
simply was not implicated in the case at hand. See id., at
379–380. Second, the Court rejected the government’s
“anomal[ou]s” suggestion that subparagraph (E) might
                  Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)              7

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

allow it, but not a prisoner, to challenge an adverse appel-
late panel decision regarding a second or successive filing.
Id., at 380–381.
   Neither holding makes sense unless subparagraph (E)
applies to federal prisoners pursuing second or successive
collateral attacks. Why take the trouble to show this fed-
eral prisoner wasn’t pursuing a second or successive attack
subject to subparagraph (E)—and why bother rejecting the
government’s lopsided argument about how subpara-
graph (E) works—if subparagraph (E) has no bearing what-
soever on federal prisoners in the first place? While Castro
may not have announced a “holding” that subparagraph (E)
applies to federal prisoners pursuing second or successive
collateral attacks, ante, at 9, n. 3, all of its work was surely
grounded on that premise.
   Our decision in Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236
(1998), is equally telling. That case concerned 28 U. S. C.
§2253(c), which requires a federal prisoner to obtain a cer-
tificate of appealability (COA) before he may appeal a dis-
trict court’s adverse decision in a §2255 proceeding. The
jurisdictional question before the Court was whether a
court of appeals’ denial of a COA is a “case” within the
meaning of §1254(1) and thus reviewable on certiorari. 524
U. S., at 241. Concluding that it is, the Court leaned heav-
ily on a comparison between §2253(c) and §2244(b)(3)(E).
The latter provision, the Court said, imposes a “clear limit”
on our jurisdiction. Id., at 250. And, the Court reasoned,
the existence of that “clear limit,” coupled with the absence
of comparable language in §2253(c), suggested that federal
prisoners may seek certiorari to challenge an adverse COA
decision. See id., at 249–250. Much as in Castro, the Court
in Hohn may not have expressly reached a holding about
§2244(b)(3)(E)’s meaning. But its work only makes sense if
that provision “clear[ly]” precludes certiorari jurisdiction
for federal prisoners.
8                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

   Really, the idea that §2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal
prisoners and bars them from seeking certiorari has been
uncontroversial since AEDPA’s adoption three decades ago.
So much so that, until recently, even the author of today’s
majority opinion accepted it. In another case involving Mr.
Bowe (yes, the same Mr. Bowe), our colleague urged the
Court to consider accepting an original habeas petition to
resolve the very same do-over circuit split now before us.
In re Bowe, 601 U. S. ___ (2024) (SOTOMAYOR, J., statement
respecting denial of habeas corpus). Invoking that unusual
procedure, our colleague insisted, was necessary precisely
because “§2244(b)(3)(E)’s bar on petitioning for review”
would preclude Mr. Bowe from invoking our certiorari ju-
risdiction. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). That was right then,
and it is right still.
                               B
   How does Mr. Bowe respond? He does not dispute that
all the rules laid out in §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (E) apply to
state prisoners. As a result, he acknowledges, neither state
prisoners nor state officials may challenge an appellate
panel’s certification decision on certiorari. Accordingly,
there are only two ways to resolve circuit splits about §2244
in the state-prisoner context: original habeas writs and cer-
tification under §1254(2).
   Even when it comes to federal prisoners, Mr. Bowe cedes
much ground. He admits that §2255(h) subjects federal
prisoners to the same rules that apply to state prisoners in
§§2244(b)(3)(A), (B), (C), and (D). Brief for Petitioner 32.
He concedes, too, that every court of appeals to consider the
issue has held that subparagraph (E) also applies to federal
prisoners. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. Still, Mr. Bowe insists, he’s
discovered something all those courts (and this one) have
missed for the past 30 years: Subparagraph (E)—and it
alone—doesn’t apply to federal prisoners.

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

   His theory runs this way. Section 2255(h) instructs that
a federal prisoner’s second or successive attack “must be
certified as provided in section 2244.” That language, Mr.
Bowe submits, sweeps in only those parts of §2244 that ad-
dress how an appellate panel goes about certifying a second
or successive filing. And it does not sweep in subpara-
graph (E) because—unlike all of §2244(b)(3)’s other subpar-
agraphs—it does not “provide” for certification.
   It may be a wonderfully convenient theory for Mr. Bowe,
but no court has adopted it for good reason. Just look again
at the block quotation of statutory text above. Each and
every one of §2244(b)(3)’s subparagraphs “provide[s]” for
how a second or successive collateral attack “must be certi-
fied” by a “panel of the appropriate court of appeals.”
§2255(h). Subparagraph (A) routes the certification deci-
sion to a court of appeals. Subparagraph (B) directs that
the decision must be made by a three-judge panel. Subpar-
agraph (C) sets forth the standard the panel must use when
deciding whether to certify. Subparagraph (D) specifies the
timing for a decision. And subparagraph (E) provides that
panel certification is the exclusive avenue for certification
decisions (without foreclosing the panel from asking this
Court, via §1254(2), for “instructions” on “question[s] of
law” along the way). What begins with an application to a
three-judge panel under subparagraph (A) ends with its
disposition by that same panel under subparagraph (E).
   Notice, too, the hash Mr. Bowe’s interpretation makes of
the rest of the statute. Subparagraph (B) mandates that a
certification motion “shall be determined by a three-judge
panel of the court of appeals.” What would be the point of
that direction if, as Mr. Bowe suggests, a prisoner could pe-
tition a court of appeals (en banc) or this Court (on certio-
rari) to certify a second or successive collateral attack in-
stead? Plainly, subparagraph (E) works in tandem with
subparagraph (B) to ensure that the certification decision
10                    BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

comes from, and only from, a three-judge panel. Ignoring
(E) undermines (B).
   Ignoring (E) also makes a nonsense of subparagraph (D)’s
instruction requiring a panel to grant or deny certification
within 30 days. That mandate is perfectly sensible if, as
subparagraph (E) provides, the decision of a three-judge
panel is final. But it is wholly insensible if, as Mr. Bowe
supposes, any prisoner can seek panel rehearing, then en
banc rehearing, and certiorari too. The entire point of
AEDPA and its certification process was to “reduce delays,”
Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 276 (2005) (internal quota-
tion marks omitted), and “advance the finality of criminal
convictions,” Mayle, 545 U. S., at 662. Yet on Mr. Bowe’s
reading, the certification process alone would typically take
not 30 days but many multiples of that.2
                             C
  Mr. Bowe’s line of argument, understandably, causes my
colleagues some discomfort. Thankfully, they are unwilling
to say—as Mr. Bowe does—that every court of appeals to
have reached the issue has erred in holding that subpara-
graph (E) bars federal prisoners from seeking panel or en
banc rehearing. Ante, at 16. To avoid calling those sound
decisions into question, the majority pivots in a different
direction. On its theory, even if subparagraph (E) bars fed-
eral prisoners from pursuing petitions for panel and en
banc rehearing, the statute does not bar them from seeking
certiorari.
——————
  2 Mr. Bowe suggests this is no problem because subparagraph (E) al-

lows courts of appeals to order rehearing sua sponte. And having discov-
ered porosity in this otherwise solid subparagraph, Mr. Bowe wonders
why we need to worry about finality at all. But even if AEDPA tolerates
sua sponte rehearing, that is no threat to finality because sua sponte re-
hearing is rare, and judges do not call for it needlessly. The same is true
of certification under §1254(2), for that matter. These modest, rarely
employed, and judicially initiated procedures are hardly camels’ noses
poking under AEDPA’s tent.

   There is an obvious reason Mr. Bowe did not press that
eccentric theory before us: It cannot be squared with the
statutory text. Section 2255 instructs that a federal pris-
oner’s second or successive attack “must be certified as pro-
vided in section 2244.” And what subparagraph (E) “pro-
vide[s]” is a package deal. The statute bars rehearing
petitions and certiorari petitions in a single breath: It pro-
vides that a panel’s certification decision “shall not be the
subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.”
§2244(b)(3)(E). The notion that all of subparagraph (E)
might apply to federal prisoners minus the six words “or for
a writ of certiorari” is utterly implausible as a textual mat-
ter.
   One might think this problem would cause the majority
to hesitate. Instead, my colleagues plow on, conjuring up a
clear-statement rule to support their course. Yes, the ma-
jority admits, a fair reading of §2255(h)’s cross-reference to
§2244 “might include” §2244(b)(3)(E)’s certiorari bar. Ante,
at 19. But, my colleagues insist, Congress “must speak
clearly” when it wishes to withdraw our certiorari jurisdic-
tion, ante, at 8, and the language Congress employed here
is not “clear” enough to be worth following, ante, at 12–14.
   There’s no avoiding the odd contours of the majority’s
clear-statement rule. Apparently, Congress may restrict
and channel collateral review in the lower courts, as it has
done in subparagraphs (A) through (D). Congress may also
bar petitions for panel or en banc rehearing, as it has done
in subparagraph (E), cutting off the usual method by which
a court of appeals “reconcile[s] its internal difficulties.”
Wisniewski v. United States, 353 U. S. 901, 902 (1957)
(per curiam). Seemingly, Congress can do all that without
having to satisfy any clear-statement rule. The only work
the majority’s rule performs concerns certiorari petitions—
and the only effect that rule has is to pencil out subpara-
graph (E)’s six words “or for a writ of certiorari” in cases

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

involving federal prisoners. All while leaving those same
six words in force when it comes to state prisoners.
   That gerrymandered rule may suit Mr. Bowe’s present
needs and appeal to our vanity. But it is pointless. Even if
a clear statement were required here, Congress gave us one.
For all the reasons explored above, AEDPA’s certiorari bar
imposes, in Hohn’s words, a “clear limit” on our jurisdiction.
See Part I–A, supra. Nor, again, is there any need to pre-
tend otherwise just to address the circuit split Mr. Bowe
identifies, for we can just as easily reach it through certifi-
cation under §1254(2) as we can through certiorari under
§1254(1). Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit refused to invoke
§1254(2) only because it believed we would deny certifica-
tion—a belief we could easily dispel in this case simply by
saying it isn’t so. See App. 78–79.
   Worse still, the majority’s bespoke certiorari-for-federal-
prisoners-clear-statement rule lacks any grounding in law.
Just ask yourself: If not from thin air, where could such a
rule possibly come from?
   Perhaps the most obvious candidate would be the Consti-
tution. Sometimes, after all, when faced with two compet-
ing statutory interpretations this Court invokes the canon
of constitutional avoidance to choose the one that avoids,
rather than implicates, a constitutional problem. See, e.g.,
Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381–382 (2005). But the
majority does not rest its clear-statement rule on that doc-
trine. Nor could it. This Court has already expressly re-
jected the notion that §2244(b)(3)’s limitations violate the
Suspension Clause or the Exceptions Clause, the two con-
stitutional provisions most obviously relevant to cases like
this one. See Felker, 518 U. S., at 661–664.
   That should come as no surprise either. The writ of ha-
beas corpus traditionally addressed cases of executive de-
tention without trial. Accordingly, a federal prisoner was
ineligible for habeas corpus if he had been convicted by a
court of competent jurisdiction. See id., at 663; Brown v.
                  Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)           13

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

Davenport, 596 U. S. 118, 128–129 (2022). It was not until
the 20th century that this Court began allowing federal
prisoners to mount collateral attacks on jurisdictionally
sound convictions. Cf. Glasgow v. Moyer, 225 U. S. 420, 429
(1912) (“The principle of the cases is the simple one that if
a court has jurisdiction of the case the writ of habeas corpus
cannot be employed to re-try the issues, whether of law,
constitutional or other, or of fact”). Put simply, for much of
our Nation’s history, there was no collateral review of the
vast majority of convictions, much less a right to certiorari
in such cases.
   With constitutional avoidance off the table, the majority
advances an unbriefed theory to prop up its novel clear-
statement rule. Citing Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S.
199 (2022), the majority observes that this Court generally
reads statutorily prescribed procedural requirements as
forfeitable claim-processing rules rather than unwavering
jurisdictional mandates unless Congress “clearly” indicates
otherwise. Ante, at 11. And, the majority insists, it is doing
something similar here. See ibid. Hardly. No one disputes
that AEDPA’s certiorari bar at issue here is jurisdictional.
So Boechler not only does not “contro[l] this case,” ante, at
11, n. 5, it has nothing to say about this case at all.
   The majority’s invocation of Boechler is not just inapt, it
is unfortunate. Two years ago, in an obscure administra-
tive law case, this Court expressly refused to treat Boechler
as a permission slip for creating any manner of new inter-
pretive presumptions that may happen to suit our tastes
but that do not “approximat[e] rea[l]” statutory meaning.
Compare Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U. S.
369, 455, n. 1 (2024) (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (arguing that,
in light of cases like Boechler, we may as well accept other
interpretive fictions like Chevron), with 603 U. S., at 399
(majority opinion) (holding otherwise). Yet that is exactly
how the majority treats Boechler today.
14                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

   The picture does not improve from there. The Boechler
clear-statement rule operates only in a particular context
and exists only for particular reasons. Treating too many
rules as jurisdictional rather than as claim-processing
rules, this Court has said, would “result in the waste of ju-
dicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.” Hen-
derson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 434 (2011). Yet neither
of those rationales applies here. If anything, it is the ma-
jority’s new rule that promises to waste judicial resources
by undermining finality. And there is no colorable argu-
ment that Congress acts unfairly by preventing both pris-
oners and governments from appealing adverse certifica-
tion decisions. Far from respecting Boechler, then, the
majority more nearly defies it.
   With Boechler a dry hole, the majority finds itself forced
to prospect elsewhere for legal authority. Its next stop is
Castro. Ante, at 8–10. But the majority’s quote mining of
that decision only winds up highlighting just how unprece-
dented its course today really is.
   In Castro, remember, the government advocated for a lop-
sided construction of §2244(b)(3)(E). On the government’s
view, the statute permitted it to seek certiorari to challenge
a circuit decision granting certification, but precluded a fed-
eral prisoner from seeking certiorari to challenge a circuit
decision denying certification. 540 U. S., at 380. As we
have seen, the Court rejected that submission for two rea-
sons. First, the prisoner there did not seek to pursue a sec-
ond or successive attack subject to subparagraph (E). Sec-
ond, the government’s reading would have “close[d] our
doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review” while
leaving those same doors open to the government. Id., at
381. Expanding on the second rationale, the Court said it
would not endorse such an “anomal[ous]” reading of subpar-
agraph (E) “without any clear indication that such was Con-
gress’ intent.” Id., at 380–381. Doubtless, this commentary
reflected an intuition that Congress would not lightly treat
                      Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                     15

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

similarly situated litigants differently. But none of that
speaks to the situation before us, where the construction of
subparagraph (E) at issue is fair and square: no certiorari
review of certification decisions, no matter who won below.
   If anything, and as we have seen, Castro does more to
hurt than help the majority’s cause. See Part I–A, supra.
Throughout that decision, the Court took as given that sub-
paragraph (E) does bar federal prisoners from seeking cer-
tiorari to challenge adverse certification decisions regard-
ing their second or successive filings. Why (again) would
Castro take the trouble to explain that the challenge there
wasn’t a second or successive one if subparagraph (E)
doesn’t apply to federal prisoners anyway? And why would
Castro worry about the anomalous possibility that only the
government may seek certiorari when, in fact, federal pris-
oners can too?
   The majority offers no colorable answers to these ques-
tions because none can be had. Just like Hohn and our col-
league’s opinion two years ago in In re Bowe, Castro fully
appreciated that subparagraph (E) imposes a “clear limit”
on our certiorari jurisdiction, one applicable to federal and
state prisoners alike. Hohn, 524 U. S., at 250 (emphasis
added); see also In re Bowe, 601 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2)
(acknowledging that “§2244(b)(3)(E)’s bar on petitioning for
review” would preclude Mr. Bowe himself from seeking cer-
tiorari).3

——————
   3 Attempting to wring more yet from Castro, the majority points to its

citation of Utah v. Evans, 536 U. S. 452 (2002), for the “principle that we
read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly.” Ante, at 10 (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted). But Evans simply applied the anodyne
presumption that federal agency action is amenable to some form of ju-
dicial review. See 536 U. S., at 463 (citing Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592
(1988), and Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S.
667 (1986)). That presumption speaks not at all to the postconviction
setting, let alone second or successive collateral attacks like this one. In
this context, a litigant has already enjoyed extensive judicial review,
16                   BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                        GORSUCH, J., dissenting

  Unable to identify any plausible authority in existing law
for its clear-statement rule, the majority is ultimately left
to summon it from the ether. To be sure, my colleagues
begin by pointing to the (unremarkable) principle that this
Court does not read “statutory silence as implicitly modify-
ing or limiting . . . jurisdiction that another statute specifi-
cally grants.” Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 83 (2010);
Felker, 518 U. S., at 660–661. But from there, the majority
engages in pure invention, devising a broad new legal rule
that even express limitations on our certiorari jurisdiction
are unenforceable absent a clear statement. See ante, at 8.
  What a leap that is. This case is nothing like those in
which we have historically declined to infer limitations on
our certiorari jurisdiction based on statutory silence. All
agree that §2255(h) expressly incorporates portions of
§2244(b)(3). All agree that §2244(b)(3)(E) expressly bars
“petition[s] for . . . writ[s] of certiorari.” The only point of
disagreement concerns how those explicit provisions fit to-
gether. I believe they fit together in a way that deprives us
of jurisdiction. But even if I am wrong about that, this is
hardly a case of “silen[t] or ambiguous” text, Hertz, 559
U. S., at 83–84, nor one involving provisions that “mak[e]
no mention of our authority,” Felker, 518 U. S., at 661.
Truly, the majority’s clear-statement rule comes from no-
where at all.
  In the end, neither Mr. Bowe’s textual arguments nor the
majority’s atextual theory can obscure AEDPA’s message,
one every court of appeals (and this Court) has understood
since 1996. A litigant like Mr. Bowe may seek to pursue an
original habeas petition in this Court. A court of appeals
may certify questions to us. But §2244 bars state prisoners
(and governments) from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction
to challenge adverse certification decisions. Section 2255

including at least two opportunities to seek certiorari from us—first on
direct review, and again in a first postconviction challenge.

extends that bar to federal prisoners. And because that bar
applies here, we lack jurisdiction to decide this case. The
majority’s conclusion otherwise is as improbable as it is
novel.4
                              II
  Because the majority concludes that we have jurisdiction
to reach the merits, I offer my views too. The question here,
recall, concerns the Eleventh Circuit’s refusal to certify Mr.
Bowe’s latest collateral attack. Like most other circuits, the
Eleventh Circuit has held that §2244(b)(1) bars do-over
claims by both state and federal prisoners. And that provi-
sion, the court reasoned, barred Mr. Bowe’s present chal-
lenge because he has already pursued the same challenge
many times before.


——————
   4 In a final foray, Mr. Bowe and JUSTICE JACKSON contend that, even if

subparagraph (E)’s certiorari bar generally applies to federal prisoners,
it still does not apply in this particular case. Mr. Bowe’s version of the
argument goes like this. Subparagraph (E) bars certiorari petitions from
appellate orders that “grant or den[y]” certification to pursue a second or
successive attack. And, Mr. Bowe submits, that language doesn’t apply
to him because the Eleventh Circuit “dismissed” rather than “denied” his
certification request. See App. 79. This argument fails, though, because
“the label attached to an order is not dispositive”; its “ ‘practical effect’ ”
is. Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. 579, 594 (2018). And here, the practical
effect of the Eleventh Circuit’s “dismissal” order was to deny Mr. Bowe
permission to pursue his second or successive attack.
   JUSTICE JACKSON’s version of the argument proceeds differently. She
admits that a dismissal may have the practical effect of a denial. Ante,
at 2 (concurring opinion). But, she insists, that doesn’t hold true here
because, by applying §2244(b)(1)’s do-over bar, the Eleventh Circuit ap-
plied the wrong “statutory criteria” to Mr. Bowe. Ante, at 4. There is
just one problem. The statute bars review of any “grant or denial,” not
any “grant or denial made after applying the correct statutory criteria.”
JUSTICE JACKSON identifies nothing in the statute’s terms that might al-
low us to turn the Eleventh Circuit’s (supposed) merits error into a juris-
dictionally decisive event. A denial is a denial. Recognizing the flaws of
both versions of the argument, the majority rightly adopts neither.
18                 BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                     GORSUCH, J., dissenting

  In reversing the Eleventh Circuit, my colleagues do not
question that §2244(b)(1) prohibits state prisoners’ do-over
claims. Nor do my colleagues question that Mr. Bowe seeks
to pursue a do-over claim in this case. Instead, they hold
that federal prisoners like him are free to file in district
court as many do-over claims as they please. Once more, I
disagree because I see nothing in AEDPA’s text that sup-
ports that kind of special treatment for federal prisoners.
                               A
   Begin by walking through the relevant statutory provi-
sions. Section 2255 requires a federal prisoner to satisfy
two essential requirements before he can pursue a second
or successive challenge. First, his filing must “contain” ei-
ther new facts or new law sufficient to satisfy §2255(h)(1)
or (h)(2). Second, his filing “must be certified” by a court of
appeals under the rules outlined in §2244. And to win cer-
tification under §2244, everyone accepts, a federal prisoner
must satisfy at least §§2244(b)(3)(A), (B), (C), and (D). Ante,
at 12–13. (With jurisdiction now out of the picture, we can
set aside the dispute over (E).)
   From there the right answer lies only a few steps away.
Section 2244(b)(3)(C) states that “[t]he court of appeals may
authorize the filing of a second or successive application
only if it determines that the application makes a prima fa-
cie showing that the application satisfies the requirements
of this subsection.” (Emphasis added.) No one questions
that this provision applies to state and federal prisoners
equally. Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for United States 25–
26; ante, at 12–13. So by its terms, this provision means a
federal prisoner must make “a prima facie showing” in a
court of appeals that his second or successive filing satisfies
the requirements of “this subsection”—namely, subsec-
tion (b) of §2244.
   That tells us all we need to know. The very first provision
of subsection (b) prohibits do-over claims. In the words of
                      Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                      19

                         GORSUCH, J., dissenting

§2244(b)(1), any claim presented in a prior application
“shall be dismissed.” As a result, AEDPA no more tolerates
repetitive litigation by federal prisoners than it does by
state prisoners. And the Eleventh Circuit was right to deny
Mr. Bowe leave to file again the same claim he had already
pursued many times before.
   What the statutory language teaches on this point, con-
text confirms.      Next to subsection (b)(1) sits subsec-
tion (b)(2). There, Congress addressed second or successive
filings presenting new (as opposed to do-over) claims. As
laid out in the margin, subsection (b)(2)’s rules for state
prisoners’ new claims are similar to, but different from,
§2255(h)’s rules for federal prisoners’ new claims.5 And be-
cause §2255(h) applies particularly to federal prisoners, its
specific requirements displace §2244(b)(2)’s more generally
applicable ones. See Baltimore Nat. Bank v. State Tax
Comm’n of Md., 297 U. S. 209, 215 (1936). So when a court
of appeals asks whether a federal prisoner has made a
“prima facie showing” that his proposed filing “satisfies the
requirements of this subsection” under §2244(b)(3)(C), the
requirements of §§2255(h)(1)–(2) step into the shoes that
§2244(b)(2) would otherwise fill.        Tellingly, however,
§2255(h) contains no such federal-prisoner-specific lan-
guage when it comes to do-over claims. Instead, it leaves
§2244(b)(1)’s generally applicable language in place. All of
——————
   5 Section 2244(b)(2)(B)’s new-facts provision requires that

   “(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered
previously through the exercise of due diligence; and
   “(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the
evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and con-
vincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-
finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.”
   In contrast, §2255(h)(1)’s new-facts provision requires
   “newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the
evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and con-
vincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the mo-
vant guilty of the offense.”
20                    BOWE v. UNITED STATES

which suggests that §2244(b)(1) applies no less to federal
prisoners than to state prisoners—just as the text says.6
   Another contextual clue comes from the 30-day clock.
Just as with §2244(b)(3)(C), no one questions that
§2244(b)(3)(D) applies to both federal and state prisoners.
Under that provision, a federal court of appeals has just 30
days to issue a certification decision. Complying with that
tight deadline is possible if courts of appeals can dispose of
do-over claims without further inquiry. But complying is a
good deal harder if panels must ask whether each and every
proposed collateral attack involves new evidence of inno-
cence or a retroactively applicable rule of constitutional
law. In this case, for example, it took me five minutes to
appreciate that Mr. Bowe has already advanced, many
times before, the same claim he proposes to pursue here. I
do not know, nor would it be so easy to determine, whether
Mr. Bowe’s latest filing makes a compelling showing of new
facts or new law. Contra, ante, at 23 (majority erroneously
suggesting that determining whether a litigant “has raised
a claim before” is no easier than determining whether he
has identified compelling new facts or law).
   Statutory structure and history, too, have something to
say. Before AEDPA, separate provisions addressed do-over
claims by state prisoners and federal prisoners. Back then,
§2244 permitted (but did not require) a court to deny relief
to a state prisoner who “present[ed] no new ground not
heretofore presented and determined” in a prior

   6 The majority claims my understanding of how §2244(b)(2) and

§2255(h) interact renders §2255(h)(2) “mere surplusage.” Ante, at 22–
23. But that claim is easily falsified. If §2255(h)(2) really were “mere
surplusage,” then it could be struck out of the statute with no change.
So, then, imagine a version of §2255(h) without subsection (h)(2). That
imaginary provision would require every “second or successive motion . . .
to contain . . . newly discovered evidence” capable of satisfying subsec-
tion (h)(1)’s new-facts requirement. That is very different from the real
§2255(h), which allows a prisoner to show either new facts, §2255(h)(1),
or new law, §2255(h)(2).

application. 28 U. S. C. §2244(a) (1988 ed.); 62 Stat. 965–
966. Similarly, §2255 said that a court “shall not be re-
quired to entertain a second or successive motion for similar
relief ” by a federal prisoner. See 28 U. S. C. §2255 (1988
ed.). In AEDPA, Congress amended both provisions. Now,
§2255(h) channels second or successive §2255 motions
through the §2244 rules applicable to state prisoners. And
AEDPA added to §2244 a new mandatory (no longer per-
missive) bar against do-over claims, flatly directing that
they “shall be dismissed.” §2244(b)(1); 110 Stat. 1220–
1221.
   Exactly nothing in this history or AEDPA’s structure sug-
gests Congress sought to loosen do-over restrictions for an-
yone—let alone completely do away with those restrictions
for federal prisoners. To the contrary, the statute’s history
and structure suggest, as we have long observed, that
AEDPA imposed new and “strict[er] limit[s]” on postconvic-
tion relief. Jones, 599 U. S., at 476. All of which indicates,
once again, that Congress meant what it said in
§2244(b)(3)(C): The “requirements of this subsection” apply
to federal and state prisoners alike—and those require-
ments include subsection (b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims.
                              B
   Seeking some way to justify a rule prohibiting state pris-
oners from pursuing do-over claims—but also allowing fed-
eral prisoners to do just that—Mr. Bowe and the majority
offer a grab bag of unpersuasive theories.
   First, the majority observes that §2244(a) specifically ref-
erences “section 2255,” the provision governing federal pris-
oners’ collateral attacks, while §2244(b)(1) contains no such
reference. Because “we presume differences in language . . .
convey differences in meaning,” the majority submits, it
must follow that §2244(b)(1)’s bar on do-over claims “ap-
plies only to state prisoners.” Ante, at 20 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted).         But that cannot be right.
22                BOWE v. UNITED STATES

                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting

Section 2244 mentions “section 2255” only one time, in
§2244(a). If its absence elsewhere mattered, then none of
the rules in §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (D) would apply to fed-
eral prisoners. Yet not even the majority or Mr. Bowe
thinks that. To the contrary, both concede that the whole
point of §2255(h)’s cross-reference to §2244 is to ensure fed-
eral prisoners, just like their state counterparts, must fol-
low each of those provisions. Ante, at 12–13; Brief for Peti-
tioner 32.
   Second, and in a similar vein, Mr. Bowe stresses that sub-
section (b)(1) prohibits do-over claims “in a second or suc-
cessive habeas corpus application under section 2254.”
(Emphasis added.) Seeking to capitalize on the italicized
language, Mr. Bowe notes that §2254 governs postconvic-
tion “applications” by state prisoners, while federal prison-
ers proceed by way of §2255 “motions.” Given that differ-
ence in nomenclature, Mr. Bowe contends, subsection (b)(1)
must apply only to state prisoners because that provision
addresses “applications” and not “motions.” The majority
briefly nods in the same direction. See ante, at 20.
   This argument fails for much the same reason as its pre-
decessor. If the absence of the word “motion” in §2244 made
all the difference, then none of §§2244(b)(3)(A) through (D)’s
rules would apply to federal prisoners because each of those
provisions speaks only of “applications.” Yet, no one be-
lieves that. Instead, everyone appreciates, §2255 routes
federal prisoners’ “motions” through all those provisions. In
each, then, the word “applications” is best read as inter-
changeable with “motions,” just as most circuits have un-
derstood. Cf. Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U. S. 320, 324, n. 1
(2010) (“Although 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) refers to a habeas
‘application,’ we use the word ‘petition’ interchangeably”).
   Third, Mr. Bowe replies that there’s something else spe-
cial about subsection (b)(1).        Unlike §§2244(b)(3)(A)
through (D), he says, subsection (b)(1) doesn’t just speak of
“applications,” but “application[s] under section 2254.”

(Emphasis added.) And that more specific reference, Mr.
Bowe insists, means subsection (b)(1) cannot apply to fed-
eral prisoners proceeding under §2255. But this argument
doesn’t move the needle either. If (as it must be and as no
one seriously disputes) the term “application” in §2244 is
best read as embracing a federal §2255 “motion,” then the
phrase “application under section 2254” in §2244 should
likewise be understood to embrace a “motion under sec-
tion 2255.”7
   Fourth, the majority suggests that §2255(h)’s cross-refer-
ence to §2244 captures only the latter’s “procedures” gov-
erning “how a panel certifies a second or successive filing.”
Ante, at 21. And, the argument goes, §2244(b)(1)’s bar on
do-over claims is no mere “procedure” but instead a sub-
stantive rule about what a filing may “contai[n].” Ibid. This
theory fails too. Section 2255’s cross-reference does not
speak of a procedure/substance distinction.            Instead,
§2255(h) directs courts to “certif[y]” motions “as provided
in” §2244. Even the majority acknowledges that this lan-
guage makes §2244(b)(3)(C) applicable to federal prisoners.
Ante, at 12–13. And subparagraph (C) explicitly says “the
requirements      of    this   subsection”—which        include
§2244(b)(1)—must be satisfied before certification. It’s
more than a little telling that the majority finds itself forced

   7 That is not to say that subsection (b)(1)’s specific reference to §2254

applications, rather than to applications simpliciter, is superfluous. It
has considerable work to do—just not the work Mr. Bowe supposes. By
referencing §2254, the statute makes plain that the do-over bar applies
only to applications (or motions, as the case may be) by prisoners seeking
postconviction relief. That renders it inapplicable to habeas applications
from state prisoners in preconviction executive detention, because those
applications are filed under §2241 rather than §2254. And that distinc-
tion (unlike the one Mr. Bowe proposes between state and federal pris-
oners) makes sense. Convicted prisoners, by definition, have already re-
ceived a great deal of judicial process, so a do-over bar makes sense as to
them. Prisoners who haven’t been convicted, meanwhile, stand in very
different shoes, so Congress decided to exempt them.

both to rewrite §2255(h)’s terms and to ignore
§2244(b)(3)(C)’s directions.
   Finally, Mr. Bowe retreats to the position that federal
prisoners must be exempt from subsection (b)(1) because
AEDPA was designed to treat state prisoners more harshly
than federal prisoners. But, in fact, AEDPA often treats
the two groups the same, and not just when it comes to sec-
ond or successive filings. To take just one example, §2253(c)
requires a prisoner to secure a “certificate of appealability”
before appealing from a habeas or §2255 loss in federal dis-
trict court. State and federal prisoners alike thus must sat-
isfy that provision’s demands. See §2253(c); cf. §2266(a) (re-
quiring identical treatment for certain state- and federal-
prisoner filings). And it should shock no one that Congress
might proceed similarly here and exhibit an intolerance for
do-over claims no matter who seeks to pursue them.8

   The majority today commits two serious mistakes. First,
in its zeal to resolve a circuit split, the majority asserts ju-
risdiction where we have none. With statutory text and 30
years of case law in this Court and lower courts aligned

   8 The government offers two additional theories for Mr. Bowe on the

merits. But the majority pursues neither theory, and rightly so. For one,
the government appears to suggest that subsection (b)(1) never applies
during a court of appeals’ certification proceeding for any prisoner—state
or federal. Only after certification, on this view, may a district court
weed out do-over claims under subsection (b)(1). See Brief for United
States 44–45. But, among other defects, the government’s view would
imply that not only (b)(1) but also (b)(2) is inapplicable during certifica-
tion. And, of course, that would render the whole certification process
pointless.    For another, the government suggests that, even if
§2244(b)(1)’s do-over bar applies to federal prisoners, that rule does not
apply in this particular case because Mr. Bowe never actually filed a pre-
vious collateral attack containing a Davis claim; he only sought leave to
do so. Reply Brief 10–11. But we did not take this case to address that
case-specific argument, nor did Mr. Bowe himself clearly advance it be-
fore us.

against it, the majority bases its claim of jurisdiction on a
new and curiously contoured clear-statement rule that is as
needless as it is unprecedented. Second, and compounding
its jurisdictional overreach, the majority adopts an implau-
sible view on the merits. AEDPA didn’t suddenly free fed-
eral prisoners from pre-existing restrictions on do-over
claims. Just the opposite: It imposed additional “carefully
crafted limits” on collateral attacks by federal and state
prisoners alike. Jones, 599 U. S., at 482. And, quite unsur-
prisingly, one of those limits includes an unmistakable and
absolute bar on do-over claims. Because neither of the ma-
jority’s innovations are compatible with Congress’s direc-
tions in AEDPA, I respectfully dissent.
