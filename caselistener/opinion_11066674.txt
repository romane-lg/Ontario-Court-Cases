 THORNELL, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT
         OF CORRECTIONS v. JONES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
                  the ninth circuit
       No. 22–982. Argued April 17, 2024—Decided May 30, 2024
Respondent Danny Lee Jones was convicted of the premeditated frst-
 degree murders of Robert and Tisha Weaver and the attempted premed-
 itated murder of Robert's grandmother Katherine Gumina. Arizona
 law at the time required the trial court to “impose a sentence of death”
 if it found “one or more” statutorily enumerated “aggravating circum-
 stances” and “no mitigating circumstances suffciently substantial to call
 for leniency.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13–703(E). The trial court found
 three aggravating circumstances that applied to both Robert's and
 Tisha's murders: Jones committed multiple homicides, § 13–703(F)(8); he
 was motivated by “pecuniary” gain, § 13–703(F)(5); and the murders
 were “especially heinous, cruel or depraved,” § 13–703(F)(6). The trial
 court found an additional aggravating circumstance with respect to
Page Proof Pending Publication
 Tisha's murder: she was a young child, § 13–703(F)(9). The trial court
 also concluded that Jones had established four mitigating circumstances:
 long-term substance abuse, drug and alcohol impairment at the time of
 the murders, head trauma, and childhood abuse. 9 Record 2465. The
 court concluded that these mitigating circumstances were “not suff-
 ciently substantial to out weigh the aggravating circumstances,” so it
 sentenced Jones to death. Ibid. The Arizona Supreme Court affrmed
 after “review[ing] the entire record” and “independently weighing all of
 the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented.” State v. Jones,
 185 Ariz. 471, 492, 917 P. 2d 200, 221.
    Jones later sought state postconviction review on the theory that de-
 fense counsel was ineffective, but the Arizona courts rejected Jones's
 claims. Jones next fled a federal habeas petition in District Court and
 reasserted his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. The District
 Court held an evidentiary hearing but ultimately concluded that Jones
 could not show prejudice because the additional information he pre-
 sented “ `barely. . . alter[ed] the sentencing profle presented to the sen-
 tencing judge.' ” Jones v. Schriro, 450 F. Supp. 2d 1023, 1043 (quoting
 Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 700). The Ninth Circuit re-
 versed, but this Court vacated that judgment and remanded for the
 Ninth Circuit to determine whether, in light of Cullen v. Pinholster,
 563 U. S. 170, it had been proper to consider the new evidence presented
 at the federal evidentiary hearing. See Ryan v. Jones, 563 U. S. 932.

 On reconsideration, the Ninth Circuit again granted habeas relief. The
 panel held that it was permissible to consider the new evidence and
 concluded that there was a “reasonable probability” that “Jones would
 not have received a death sentence” if that evidence had been presented
 at sentencing. Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104, 1137. Ten judges dis-
 sented from the denial of en banc review. One dissent, joined by eight
 judges, asserted that the Ninth Circuit panel fouted Strickland by cred-
 iting “questionable, weak, and cumulative mitigation evidence” as
 “enough to overcome . . . weight[y] . . . aggravating circumstances.”
 Id., at 1155.
Held: The Ninth Circuit's interpretation and application of Strickland was
 in error. Pp. 163–172.
    (a) To succeed on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Jones
 must show that counsel provided a “defcient” performance that “preju-
 diced” him. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687. Jones can show prejudice
 only if “there is a reasonable probability that, absent [counsel's] errors,
 the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating
 and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Id., at 695. “A
 reasonable probability is a probability suffcient to undermine confdence
 in the outcome. That requires a substantial, not just conceivable, likeli-
 hood of a different result.” Pinholster, 563 U. S., at 189 (citation and
Page Proof Pending Publication
 internal quotation marks omitted). To determine whether a prisoner
 satisfes this standard, a court must “consider the totality of the evi-
 dence before the judge or jury”—both mitigating and aggravating.
 Strickland, 466 U. S., at 695.
    The Ninth Circuit departed from these well-established rules in at
 least three ways. First, it failed adequately to take into account the
 weighty aggravating circumstances. Second, it applied a strange Cir-
 cuit rule that prohibits a court in a Strickland case from assessing the
 relative strength of expert witness testimony. Third, it held that the
 District Court erred by attaching diminished persuasive value to Jones's
 mental health conditions. See 52 F. 4th, at 1129. Contrary to the
 Ninth Circuit's suggestion, Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, permits
 a sentencer to fnd mitigating evidence unpersuasive.
    Jones argues that a habeas petitioner is entitled to relief whenever he
 or she “presents substantial evidence of the kind that a reasonable sen-
 tencer might deem relevant to the defendant's moral culpability.” Brief
 for Respondent 14. This rule is squarely at odds with the established
 understanding of prejudice under Strickland, which requires a “reason-
 able probability” of a different result. Where aggravating factors
 greatly outweigh mitigating evidence, there may be no “reasonable
 probability” of a different result. Pp. 163–165.
    (b) Turning to the issue of prejudice in this case, the mitigating evi-
 dence Jones presented at the federal evidentiary hearing “would barely
156                      THORNELL v. JONES

                                 Syllabus

  have altered the sentencing profle presented to the sentencing judge,”
  and it is insuffcient to show prejudice. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 700.
  Pp. 165–170.
        (1) Jones presented evidence that, he claims, shows he suffers from
  various mental illnesses. But Arizona courts had already heard testi-
  mony that Jones “suffers from a major mental illness,” likely a “form of
  Bipolar Affective Disorder.” 4 Record 1070; 10 id., at 2567. And they
  declined to give this evidence much weight because Jones did not “estab-
  lish a causal connection between his alleged mental illness and his conduct
  on the night of the murders.” 185 Ariz., at 492, 917 P. 2d, at 221. Jones's
  new evidence did not fx that problem because Jones's experts provided no
  real link between Jones's disorders and the murders. Pp. 166–167.
        (2) Next, Jones introduced evidence that he suffers from cognitive
  impairment caused by physical trauma that he suffered during his moth-
  er's pregnancy, at birth, and later in life. But Arizona courts had al-
  ready heard extensive evidence about Jones's head trauma and cognitive
  impairment and did not fnd this evidence suffcient to warrant leniency.
  185 Ariz., at 492, 917 P. 2d, at 221. The little evidence Jones added at
  his evidentiary hearing at most corroborates the testimony that the Ari-
  zona courts already credited, and it would thus provide little beneft.
  Pp. 167–168.

        (3) In federal court, Jones also alleged sexual abuse by his grandfa-
  ther and physical abuse by his second stepfather. But this evidence
  would not help either. Again, the Arizona courts had heard about many
  other instances of childhood abuse but concluded they did not warrant
  leniency, primarily because the abuse appeared unconnected to the mur-
  ders. 185 Ariz., at 490–491, 917 P. 2d, at 219–220; 9 Record 2465. The
  new allegations are likewise not causally connected and, at any rate,
  are uncorroborated. Arizona courts would give such self-reported and
  uncorroborated evidence “little . . . mitigating weight.” State v. Sharp,
  193 Ariz. 414, 425, 973 P. 2d 1171, 1182. Pp. 168–169.
        (4) Finally, Jones produced evidence of substance abuse, but his
  history of substance abuse was “well-documented” at the time of sen-
  tencing, and the Arizona Supreme Court gave this fact “some mitigating
  weight,” 185 Ariz., at 491, 917 P. 2d, at 220. There is no reasonable
  chance Arizona courts would reach a different result on essentially the
  same evidence. Pp. 169–170.
     (c) The weakness of Jones's mitigating evidence contrasts sharply
  with the strength of the aggravating circumstances. These circum-
  stances—multiple homicides, cruelty, pecuniary motivation, and murder
  of a child—are given great weight in Arizona. The Arizona Supreme
  Court has repeatedly held that one or more of these aggravating circum-
  stances outweighed mitigation evidence—even evidence that was “not
                        Cite as: 602 U. S. 154 (2024)                      157

                                  Syllabus

  insubstantial.” State v. Hampton, 213 Ariz. 167, 185, 140 P. 3d 950, 968.
  Conversely, Jones and his amici identify no cases in which the Arizona
  Supreme Court has vacated the judgment of death in a case involving
  multiple murders—let alone all of the aggravating circumstances pres-
  ent here. The absence of such a case strongly suggests that Jones has
  no reasonable probability of escaping the death penalty. Pp. 170–171.
     (d) Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion, “the Strickland preju-
  dice analysis conducted by the Supreme Court” in other cases, 52 F. 4th,
  at 1131, does not support resentencing here. In those cases, defense
  counsel introduced little, if any, mitigating evidence at the original sen-
  tencing, and the aggravating circumstances were weaker. By contrast,
  Jones started with much more mitigation evidence, and the aggravating
  circumstances present here are weightier. Had the Ninth Circuit en-
  gaged in the analysis required by Strickland, it would have affrmed
  the decision of the District Court denying habeas relief. Pp. 171–172.

                          Opinion of the Court

  Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.
  In this case, we review a decision of the Ninth Circuit or-
dering the resentencing of a defendant who, in order to steal
a gun collection, committed three gruesome killings, includ-
ing the cold-blooded murder of a 7-year-old girl. The Ninth
Circuit held that the defendant's Sixth Amendment right
to the effective assistance of counsel was violated during
the sentencing phase of his capital trial. In reaching this
conclusion, the Ninth Circuit substantially departed from
the well-established standard articulated by this Court in
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Among
other things, the Ninth Circuit all but ignored the strong
aggravating circumstances in this case. As a result, we
must reverse the judgment below.

  Thirty-two years ago, Danny Lee Jones murdered Robert
Weaver, his 7-year-old daughter Tisha Weaver, and his
grandmother Katherine Gumina. Jones knew that Robert
owned a $2,000 gun collection, and after spending a day
drinking and talking with Robert, Jones decided he wanted
to steal the guns. He grabbed a baseball bat, beat Rob-
ert into unconsciousness, and headed indoors to fnd the
collection.
  Once inside, Jones encountered Gumina, who was watching
television, and Tisha, who was coloring in a workbook before
Knudsen of Montana, Michael T. Hilgers of Nebraska, Drew Wrigley of
North Dakota, Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma, Alan Wilson of South
Carolina, Jonathan Skrmetti of Tennessee, Ken Paxton of Texas, Sean
Reyes of Utah, Jason Miyares of Virginia, and Patrick Morrisey of
West Virginia.

heading to bed. Jones struck Gumina hard enough to crack
her skull, leaving her unconscious on the living room foor.
Tisha apparently watched Jones attack her great-
grandmother and ran to hide under her parents' bed. Marks
on the carpet show that Jones dragged the girl out from
under the bed before beating her hard enough “to create a
wound several inches wide, extending from her left ear to
her left cheek.” State v. Jones, 185 Ariz. 471, 489, 917 P. 2d
200, 218 (1996). Jones then asphyxiated Tisha with a pillow.
  Jones next began loading Robert's guns into Gumina's
car. At that point, Robert regained consciousness. “Blood
smears at the scene showed that [Robert] attempted to run
from” Jones, but Jones “struck [him] in the head several
more times. The last blow . . . was delivered while [Robert]
knelt helplessly on the foor of the garage.” 9 Appellant's
Excerpts of Record in No. 18–99005 (CA9), p. 2449 (Record).
Jones then skipped town with the guns, using them to pay
for a trip to Las Vegas.

  A short time later, Robert's wife came home from work
and discovered the gruesome scene. She called 911, but the
frst responders found that Robert and Tisha were already
dead. Gumina lived for 17 months before succumbing to her
injuries. Before Gumina died, Jones was charged with two
counts of premeditated frst-degree murder and one count of
attempted premeditated frst-degree murder, and a jury
found him guilty on all three charges.1
                                  B
  After Jones was convicted, the trial court proceeded to
sentencing. Under Arizona law at the time, the court was
required to “impose a sentence of death” if it found “one or
more” statutorily enumerated “aggravating circumstances”
and “no mitigating circumstances suffciently substantial to
call for leniency.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13–703(E) (1993).

   Arizona charged Jones before Gumina's death and elected not to amend
the indictment after she died.
160                 THORNELL v. JONES

                      Opinion of the Court

   The trial court found three aggravating circumstances that
applied to both Robert's and Tisha's murders. First, Jones
committed multiple homicides “during the commission of
the offense.” § 13–703(F)(8). Second, he was motivated by
“pecuniary” gain, namely, Robert's guns. § 13–703(F)(5).
And third, the murders were “especially heinous, cruel or
depraved.” § 13–703(F)(6). With respect to Tisha's mur-
der, the court found an additional aggravating circumstance:
She was a young child. § 13–703(F)(9).
   The trial court also heard mitigating evidence. The pre-
sentence report noted that Jones was abused as a child,
began using drugs and alcohol at age 13, suffered brain
trauma at ages 9 and 18, and had received “psychiatric treat-
ments” as a child. 4 Record 1086–1088. Jones's second
stepfather, Randy, described Jones's troubled personal life.
He testifed that Jones's father and frst stepfather were
physically abusive, that Jones's grandfather and uncle had
introduced him to drugs as a preteen, and that Jones had
Page Proof Pending Publication
suffered several head injuries that left him with “constan[t]”
headaches. 9 id., at 2522–2526.
   Jones's counsel also submitted a report by and solicited
testimony from Dr. Jack Potts, a court-appointed forensic
psychiatrist who was later described by counsel as essen-
tially “part of the defense team.” 7 id., at 1831. Dr. Potts
identifed several “mitigating factors” that he thought war-
ranted leniency. 4 id., at 1070–1071. First, he noted that
Jones “was reared in a chaotic and at times grossly hostile
environment where physical abuse was too prevalent.” Id.,
at 1069. “The years he had of a relatively `normal' child-
hood,” Dr. Potts opined, were “too late . . . to counter the
earlier abuse.” Id., at 1070. Second, Dr. Potts suggested
that Jones's “serious head trauma” potentially “contribut[ed]
to his behavior.” Id., at 1068, 1071. Third, he concluded
with a “reasonable degree of medical certainty” that Jones
“suffers from a major mental illness,” likely a “form of Bi-
polar Affective Disorder.” Id., at 1070; 10 id., at 2567.
Fourth, he thought Jones was “genetic[ally]” predisposed to
                  Cite as: 602 U. S. 154 (2024)           161

                     Opinion of the Court

“substance abuse” and speculated that Jones would not have
murdered had he been sober. 4 id., at 1070. Fifth, Dr.
Potts believed that Jones felt “remorse and responsibility”
and that he had the “potential for rehabilitation.” Id., at
1070–1071.
  From this evidence, the trial court concluded that Jones
had established four mitigating circumstances: (1) Jones suf-
fered from long-term substance abuse; (2) that problem may
be caused by genetic factors and head trauma; (3) he was
under the infuence of alcohol and drugs at the time of the
murders; and (4) he was abused as a child. 9 id., at 2465.
The court concluded that these circumstances were “not suf-
fciently substantial to out weigh the aggravating circum-
stances,” so it sentenced Jones to death. Ibid. The Ari-
zona Supreme Court affrmed after “review[ing] the entire
record” and “independently weighing all of the aggravating
and mitigating evidence presented.” Jones, 185 Ariz., at
492, 917 P. 2d, at 221.
Page Proof Pending PublicationC
   Jones sought state postconviction review on the theory
that defense counsel was ineffective. Jones argued that his
attorney should have retained an independent neuropsychol-
ogist, rather than relying on Dr. Potts. The state court de-
nied this claim because it “remember[ed]” that Dr. Potts
“was a very good expert” at trial and “was defense
oriented.” 7 Record 1950. Jones also claimed that trial
counsel failed to make a timely request for neurological or
neuropsychological testing. But after holding an eviden-
tiary hearing on this claim, the state court rejected it on
the merits. Jones then unsuccessfully sought review in the
Arizona Supreme Court. Order in State v. Jones, No. CR–
00–0512–PC (Feb. 15, 2001); 1 Record 186.

                               D
  Jones next fled a habeas petition in Federal District Court
and reasserted his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.
See 28 U. S. C. § 2254. The District Court held an eviden-
162                      THORNELL v. JONES

tiary hearing but ultimately concluded that Jones could not
show prejudice because the additional information he pre-
sented “ `barely . . . alter[ed] the sentencing profle presented
to the sentencing judge.' ” Jones v. Schriro, 450 F. Supp. 2d
1023, 1043 (Ariz. 2006) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 700).
The court reached this conclusion based on its assessment of
“the credibility of the parties' witnesses,” including wit-
nesses introduced by the State to undercut Jones's claims.
450 F. Supp. 2d, at 1038. The Ninth Circuit reversed. See
Jones v. Ryan, 583 F. 3d 626 (2009). But this Court vacated
that judgment and remanded for the Ninth Circuit to deter-
mine whether, in light of Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. 170
(2011), it had been proper to consider the new evidence pre-
sented at the federal evidentiary hearing. See Ryan v.
Jones, 563 U. S. 932 (2011).
   On reconsideration, the Ninth Circuit again granted ha-
beas relief. The panel held that it was permissible to con-
sider the new evidence2 and concluded that there was a “rea-
Page Proof Pending Publication
sonable probability” that “Jones would not have received a
death sentence” if that evidence had been presented at sen-
tencing. Jones v. Ryan, 1 F. 4th 1179, 1196, 1204 (CA9 2021).
The panel's lengthy opinion made no mention of the aggra-
vating factors, and it did not consider the State's rebuttal
evidence.
   Arizona sought en banc review. The Ninth Circuit denied
the State's petition, but the panel amended its opinion to
mention the aggravating circumstances and to rebuke the
District Court for “weigh[ing] the testimony of [competing]
   2
     The panel reasoned that the postconviction review court had not
reached the issue of prejudice, so it could review the issue de novo. Fur-
ther, “Jones satisfed the standard for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to
§ 2254(e)(2)” because he “exercised diligence in pursuing [his] claims in
state court.” Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104, 1123 (CA9 2022). Arizona
does not challenge either determination. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22; Brief
for Petitioner 20, n. 8. So we do not decide whether the Ninth Circuit's
interpretation of either the postconviction review court's decision or
§ 2254(e)(2) is correct.

experts against each other.” Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104,
1128 (2022).
  Ten judges dissented from the denial of en banc review.
Judge Ikuta, joined by two other judges, argued that the
panel should have deferred to the state postconviction re-
view court on the Strickland prejudice inquiry. Judge Ben-
nett, joined by eight others, assumed without deciding that
the panel could consider the new evidence. But he asserted
that the panel fouted Strickland by crediting “questionable,
weak, and cumulative mitigation evidence” as “enough to
overcome . . . weight[y] . . . aggravating circumstances.” 52
F. 4th, at 1155 (dissenting opinion). If not corrected, Judge
Bennett wrote, the panel's errors would enable “courts to
improperly grant sentencing relief to capital defendants who
have been convicted of the most horrifc crimes.” Id., at
1137.
  We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's in-
terpretation and application of Strickland. 601 U. S. –––

                                II
   Jones claims that his Sixth Amendment right to the effec-
tive assistance of counsel was violated during the sentencing
phase of his capital trial. To succeed on such a claim, a de-
fendant must show that counsel provided a “defcient” per-
formance that “prejudiced” him. Strickland, 466 U. S., at
687. When an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is
based on counsel's performance at the sentencing phase of
a capital case, a defendant is prejudiced only if “there is a
reasonable probability that, absent [counsel's] errors, the sen-
tencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggra-
vating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.”
Id., at 695. “A reasonable probability is a probability suff-
cient to undermine confdence in the outcome. That re-
quires a substantial, not just conceivable, likelihood of a dif-
ferent result.” Pinholster, 563 U. S., at 189 (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted). This standard does not

                      Opinion of the Court

require a defendant to show that it is more likely than not
that adequate representation would have led to a better re-
sult, but “[t]he difference” should matter “only in the rarest
case.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 697. To determine whether
a prisoner satisfes this standard, a court must “consider the
totality of the evidence before the judge or jury”—both miti-
gating and aggravating. Id., at 695.
   The Ninth Circuit departed from these well-established
rules in at least three ways. First, it failed adequately to
take into account the weighty aggravating circumstances in
this case. As noted, the panel's initial opinion did not men-
tion those circumstances at all. After the State petitioned
for rehearing and 10 judges voted to grant the petition, the
panel issued an amended opinion that at least mentioned the
aggravating circumstances, but it failed to give them the
weight that they would almost certainly be accorded by an
Arizona sentencing judge.

   Second, the Ninth Circuit applied a strange Circuit rule
that prohibits a court in a Strickland case from assessing
the relative strength of expert witness testimony. See 52
F. 4th, at 1128–1129. This rule is clearly unsound. Deter-
mining whether a defense expert's report or testimony
would have created a reasonable probability of a different
result if it had been offered at trial necessarily requires an
evaluation of the strength of that report or testimony. And
where a prosecution expert has expressed a contrary opin-
ion, it is hard to see how a court could decide how much
weight to give the defense expert without making a compar-
ative analysis.
   Third, the Ninth Circuit held that the District Court erred
by attaching diminished persuasive value to Jones's mental
health conditions because it saw no link between those condi-
tions and Jones's conduct when he committed the three mur-
ders. See id., at 1129. The Ninth Circuit seemed to sug-
gest that this conclusion was supported by Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), but that is not so. Eddings
                   Cite as: 602 U. S. 154 (2024)           165

                      Opinion of the Court

held that a sentencer may not “refuse to consider . . . any
relevant mitigating evidence.” Id., at 114. It did not hold
that a sentencer cannot fnd mitigating evidence unpersua-
sive. See id., at 114–115 (emphasizing that “[t]he sentencer
. . . may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigat-
ing evidence”).
   Picking up what he takes to be the implications of these
three features of the Ninth Circuit's analysis, Jones argues
that a habeas petitioner is entitled to relief whenever he or
she “presents substantial evidence of the kind that a reason-
able sentencer might deem relevant to the defendant's moral
culpability.” Brief for Respondent 14. Whether or not this
rule represents a fair extrapolation of the Ninth Circuit's
reasoning, it is squarely at odds with the established under-
standing of prejudice, which requires a “reasonable probabil-
ity” of a different result. Imagine a defendant with the
worst possible aggravating circumstances, say, multiple, vul-
nerable victims; torture; a lengthy record of violent crime;
Page Proof Pending Publication
no remorse; and a vow to kill again if given the chance. Ac-
cording to Jones, if the defense is able to show that trial
counsel failed to produce any mitigating evidence that can be
characterized as “substantial,” the defendant must be resen-
tenced. But in such a case, where the aggravating factors
greatly outweigh the mitigating evidence, there may be no
“reasonable probability” of a different result. Thus, Jones's
argument is squarely inconsistent with Strickland.

                               III
   With the proper understanding of Strickland in mind, we
turn to the prejudice issue in this case. Most of the mitigat-
ing evidence Jones presented at the federal evidentiary hear-
ing was not new, and what was new would not carry much
weight in Arizona courts. Conversely, the aggravating fac-
tors present here are extremely weighty. As a result, there
is no reasonable probability that the evidence on which Jones
relies would have altered the outcome at sentencing.
166                  THORNELL v. JONES

                      Opinion of the Court

                               A
   We begin with the mitigating evidence. In the District
Court, Jones introduced evidence of (1) mental illness,
(2) cognitive impairment caused by a history of head trauma,
(3) childhood abuse, and (4) substance abuse. Jones claims
that this evidence requires resentencing, but as the District
Court aptly observed, this evidence “would barely have al-
tered the sentencing profle presented to the sentencing
judge,” and it is insuffcient to show prejudice. Strickland,
466 U. S., at 699–700.
                               1
   Jones claims that his newly proffered evidence shows that
he suffers from “PTSD, AD/HD, mood disorder, [and] bipolar
depressive disorder.” Brief for Respondent 45. But it is
not reasonably likely that this evidence would have resulted
in a different sentence.
   Arizona courts had already received testimony that Jones
Page Proof Pending Publication
“suffers from a major mental illness,” likely a “form of Bipo-
lar Affective Disorder.” 4 Record 1070; 10 id., at 2567. Yet
they declined to give this evidence much weight because
Jones did not “establish a causal connection between his al-
leged mental illness and his conduct on the night of the mur-
ders.” Jones, 185 Ariz., at 492, 917 P. 2d, at 221; accord,
State v. Prince, 226 Ariz. 516, 542, 250 P. 3d 1145, 1171 (2011)
(discounting poor mental health when no “expert could es-
tablish [the defendant's] mental state on the night of the
shootings”); State v. Boggs, 218 Ariz. 325, 343, 185 P. 3d 111,
129 (2008) (same).
   Jones's new evidence did not fx that problem. One of
Jones's experts reiterated that Jones has a mood disorder,
but he did not express an opinion on whether that disorder
affected Jones on the night of the murders. 4 Record 823–
825. Two experts diagnosed Jones with PTSD, but neither
testifed that he experienced such symptoms at the time of
the murders. 2 id., at 506–508; id., at 451–453. Likewise,
                    Cite as: 602 U. S. 154 (2024)              167

                       Opinion of the Court

no expert linked Jones's AD/HD to the murders; indeed, one
of the State's witnesses testifed that there is no link be-
tween that disorder and violence. Id., at 459. Because
none of Jones's experts provided a real link between Jones's
disorders and the murders, their testimony would have done
him little good in the Arizona courts. See State v. Poyson,
250 Ariz. 48, 53, 58, 475 P. 3d 293, 298, 303 (2020) (failure to
link mitigating evidence to the crime may diminish its
weight); State v. Stuard, 176 Ariz. 589, 608, n. 12, 863 P. 2d
881, 900, n. 12 (1993) (“[E]vidence of causation is required
before mental impairment can be considered a signifcant
mitigating factor”).
                               2
   Next, Jones introduced evidence that he suffers from cog-
nitive impairment caused by physical trauma that he suf-
fered during his mother's pregnancy, at birth, and later in
life. Brief for Respondent 44. But there is no reason to
Page Proof Pending Publication
think that this evidence would have meaningfully changed
how the state court viewed the case.
   Arizona courts had already heard extensive evidence
about Jones's head trauma and cognitive impairment. For
instance, the sentencing court learned that Jones's biological
father knocked his mother down stairs when she was preg-
nant with him, 4 Record 1067; 9 id., 2523, that his birth was
traumatic, ibid., and that he was physically abused by his
frst stepfather, 4 id., at 1067. The sentencing court knew
that Jones had been knocked unconscious as the result of
three falls during childhood and adolescence and a mugging
in his late teens. Id., at 1068, 1087; 9 id., at 2526, 2528–2529;
10 id., at 2556–2557, 2569, 2580. It also heard from Dr. Potts
that Jones's head trauma potentially contributed to his be-
havior. 4 id., at 1068, 1071. Yet it did not fnd this evidence
suffcient to warrant leniency. And after reviewing the
same evidence, the Arizona Supreme Court concurred.
Jones, 185 Ariz., at 492, 917 P. 2d, at 221 (crediting Dr. Potts's
assumption that Jones had brain damage).
168                  THORNELL v. JONES

                      Opinion of the Court

   Jones added little on this issue at his evidentiary hearing.
He alleged a few additional head injuries from car accidents
and fghts, but “there is no medical documentation to corrob-
orate any of these injuries.” Jones, 450 F. Supp. 2d, at 1039,
and n. 11. And though his experts fagged a handful of poor
test scores and grades, Jones's IQ and standardized test
scores are mostly average. 2 Record 347, 358–376, 379–399;
3 id., at 798. This vague evidence at most “corroborate[s]”
testimony the Arizona courts already credited. Jones, 185
Ariz., at 492, 917 P. 2d, at 221. Introducing it “would have
offered an insignifcant beneft, if any at all.” Wong v. Bel-
montes, 558 U. S. 15, 23 (2009) (per curiam).

                               3
   Jones also alleges signifcant childhood abuse. Brief for
Respondent 44. Again, however, Arizona courts had heard
much on this topic. They knew that Jones's father abused
Page Proof Pending Publication
his pregnant mother, that his frst stepfather beat both of
them, and that his grandfather introduced him to drugs at a
young age. And they received testimony that any period of
normalcy during Jones's childhood was “too late” and “not
strong enough to counter the earlier abuse.” 4 Record
1069–1070. They nevertheless concluded that this abuse did
not warrant leniency, primarily because it appeared uncon-
nected to the murders. Jones, 185 Ariz., at 490–491, 917
P. 2d, at 219–220; 9 Record 2465.
   In federal court, Jones added two new allegations. First,
he asserted that the grandfather who introduced him to alco-
hol also sexually abused him. Second, he claimed that his
second stepfather, Randy, physically abused him. It is not
likely that these allegations would have moved the state
court either.
   The sexual-abuse allegation is entirely uncorroborated.
Jones did not mention it until his federal habeas proceedings.
2 id., at 503–504. And his mother and second stepfather
explained that they “never saw any indication [that Jones]
                   Cite as: 602 U. S. 154 (2024)             169

                      Opinion of the Court

may have been sexually abused by anyone, nor were they
aware of any sexual perpetrators in the family.” Record
in No. 2:01–cv–00384 (D Ariz., Feb. 13, 2006), ECF Doc.
172–3, p. 49. Arizona courts would give this self-reported
and uncorroborated evidence “little . . . mitigating weight.”
State v. Sharp, 193 Ariz. 414, 425, 973 P. 2d 1171, 1182 (1999);
accord, State v. Gerlaugh, 144 Ariz. 449, 462, 698 P. 2d 694,
707 (1985).
   Jones's physical-abuse allegation against Randy is not
much more helpful. Granted, his sister seconded his allega-
tion. 4 Record 982–987. But other record evidence contra-
dicts it. For instance, Jones told Dr. Potts that Randy was
“quite stern and a disciplinarian yet certainly not physically
abusive.” Id., at 1067–1068 (emphasis added). On another
occasion well before this litigation, Jones said that “[a]s far
as I'm concerned,” Randy “is my real dad[;] he's the only one
that has treated me good. He has never hit me or any-
thing.” Id., at 1020 (emphasis added). Given Jones's “obvi-
Page Proof Pending Publication
ous motive to fabricate,” Arizona courts would view this
abuse allegation with some “skepticism.” State v. Medrano,
185 Ariz. 192, 194, 914 P. 2d 225, 227 (1996); see also Ger-
laugh, 144 Ariz., at 462, 698 P. 2d, at 707; State v. Carriger,
143 Ariz. 142, 153, 692 P. 2d 991, 1002 (1984). And even
crediting the allegation, it suffers from the same weakness
that led the Arizona courts to discount Jones's other abuse
allegations: it is not causally connected to the murders.

                                4
  Finally, Jones points to evidence of substance abuse,
namely, that his grandfather introduced him to drugs and
alcohol when he was “only nine years old.” Brief for Re-
spondent 44. But Jones's history of substantive abuse was
“well-documented” at the time of sentencing. Jones, 185
Ariz., at 491, 917 P. 2d, at 220. The Arizona Supreme Court,
for instance, recounted that “by the time [Jones] was 17
years old, he had used many types of drugs and was an alco-
170                  THORNELL v. JONES

                      Opinion of the Court

holic.” Ibid.; see also 4 Record 1086–1088 (presentencing
report noting that Jones began consuming alcohol and using
drugs at 13). And that court gave this fact “some mitigating
weight.” Jones, 185 Ariz., at 491, 917 P. 2d, at 220. There
is no reasonable chance that those courts would reach a
different result on a second look at essentially the same
evidence.
                             B
   The weakness of Jones's mitigating evidence contrasts
sharply with the strength of the aggravating circumstances.
These circumstances—multiple homicides, cruelty, pecuniary
motivation, and murder of a child—are given great weight
in Arizona. See State v. Garza, 216 Ariz. 56, 72, 163 P. 3d
1006, 1022 (2007) (multiple-homicides aggravator gets “ `ex-
traordinary weight' ”); Poyson, 250 Ariz., at 57, 475 P. 3d, at
302 (the cruelty and pecuniary-motivation aggravators are
“particularly weighty”); State v. Newell, 212 Ariz. 389, 406,
Page Proof Pending Publication
132 P. 3d 833, 850 (2006) (young age of the victim is a “com-
pelling aggravating circumstanc[e]” in favor of the death
penalty).
   Indeed, in a host of cases, the Arizona Supreme Court has
held that one or more of these aggravating circumstances
outweighed mitigation evidence—even evidence that was
“not insubstantial.” State v. Hampton, 213 Ariz. 167, 185,
140 P. 3d 950, 968 (2006) (concluding that the multiple-
homicides aggravator outweighed evidence of a “horrendous
childhood”); see also Poyson, 250 Ariz., at 57–58, 475 P. 3d,
at 302–303 (listing several cases in which the multiple-
homicides aggravator alone outweighed all mitigating cir-
cumstances); State v. McKinney, 245 Ariz. 225, 227, 426 P. 3d
1204, 1206 (2018) (cruelty and pecuniary-motivation aggrava-
tors outweighed evidence that a defendant had “endured a
horrifc childhood” and suffered from mental illness). Con-
versely, Jones and his amici identify no cases in which the
Arizona Supreme Court has vacated the judgment of death
in a case involving multiple murders—let alone a case involv-

                      Opinion of the Court

ing all of the aggravating circumstances present here. The
absence of such a case strongly suggests that Jones has no
reasonable probability of escaping the death penalty.

                               IV
   To justify its contrary conclusion, the Ninth Circuit
pointed to “the Strickland prejudice analysis conducted by
the Supreme Court” in “similar cases.” 52 F. 4th, at 1131.
In these cases, the Ninth Circuit stated, we found prejudice
when counsel failed to present “classic mitigating evidence,”
even though the defendants had committed “brutal crimes.”
Id., at 1133.
   A review of the precedents cited by the Ninth Circuit
shows that they are very different from the case now before
us. In each of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel cases on
which the Ninth Circuit relied, this Court found that defense
counsel introduced little, if any, mitigating evidence at the
original sentencing. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. 30,
Page Proof Pending Publication
41 (2009) (per curiam); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,
395–398 (2000); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 378, 393
(2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 515, 534–535 (2003).
Jones, by contrast, started with much more mitigation. And
in most of the other cases, the sentencer found only a few
aggravating circumstances. See Porter, 558 U. S., at 42
(three aggravators, two of which the sentencing judge thought
“were insuffcient to warrant . . . death”); Williams, 529 U. S.,
at 370, 398 (one aggravator); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 537 (one
aggravator). That is a far cry from the weighty aggravating
circumstances present here. Poyson, 250 Ariz., at 57, 475
P. 3d, at 302.
                         *     *     *
   When a capital defendant claims that he was prejudiced at
sentencing because counsel failed to present available miti-
gating evidence, a court must decide whether it is reasonably
likely that the additional evidence would have avoided a
death sentence. This analysis requires an evaluation of the
172                   THORNELL v. JONES

                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting

strength of all the evidence and a comparison of the weight
of aggravating and mitigating factors. The Ninth Circuit
did not heed that instruction; rather, it downplayed the seri-
ous aggravating factors present here and overstated the
strength of mitigating evidence that differed very little from
the evidence presented at sentencing. Had the Ninth Cir-
cuit engaged in the analysis required by Strickland, it would
have had no choice but to affrm the decision of the District
Court denying habeas relief. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
                                                 It is so ordered.

   Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan joins,
dissenting.
   I agree with the Court that “the Ninth Circuit all but ig-
nored the strong aggravating circumstances in this case.”
Page Proof Pending Publication
Ante, at 158. That was error. As part of the prejudice
inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, courts
must “consider all the evidence—the good and the bad,”
Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. 15, 26 (2009) (per curiam), and
must “reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the total-
ity of available mitigating evidence,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539
U. S. 510, 534 (2003).
   The majority unnecessarily goes further and engages in
the reweighing itself. See ante, at 165–171. The record in
this case is complex, contested, and thousands of pages long.
In light of this “extensive record” and “intricate procedural
history, . . . this is not an appropriate case to reach and settle
[a] fact-sensitive issue.” CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v.
EEOC, 578 U. S. 419, 435 (2016). That is particularly true
when, as here, the majority in the frst instance parses a
complex record containing contested medical diagnoses and
disputed allegations of abuse and trauma.
   “It is not the Court's usual practice to adjudicate either
legal or predicate factual questions in the frst instance.”

   Justice Jackson, dissenting.
   In its search for legal error in this capital habeas case, the
Court makes many mistakes of its own, including misreading
the Ninth Circuit's opinion.* I write separately to empha-
size a particular misstep: the Court's conclusion that “the
Ninth Circuit all but ignored the strong aggravating circum-
stances in this case.” Ante, at 158. In my view, the Ninth
Circuit's analysis satisfed its obligations under Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).
   Per our longstanding test for evaluating an ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim in a capital case, a court “must
consider the totality of the evidence” and ask “whether there
is a reasonable probability that, absent the [trial counsel's]
Page Proof Pending Publication
errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the bal-
ance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not
warrant death.” Id., at 695. That is precisely what the
Ninth Circuit did here. The panel not only evaluated the
mitigating evidence that Jones's trial counsel failed to un-
earth, it also specifcally considered all of the aggravating
factors. See Jones v. Ryan, 52 F. 4th 1104, 1131 (CA9 2022).
To assess prejudice, it then reasoned extensively—by anal-
ogy—considering precedent where both the Circuit and this
Court had granted habeas relief even in the presence of simi-
lar aggravators. See id., at 1131–1133.
   To be sure, the Ninth Circuit's discussion of the aggravat-
ing factors was concise. But there is no benchmark length
for any such discussion. Indeed, this Court has granted ha-

  *Compare, e. g., ante, at 164 (accusing the panel of “appl[ying] a strange
Circuit rule that prohibits a court in a Strickland case from assessing the
relative strength of expert witness testimony”), with Jones v. Ryan, 52
F. 4th 1104, 1129 (CA9 2022) (“This is not to say, of course, that a district
court is prohibited from making credibility determinations”).
174                  THORNELL v. JONES

                     Jackson, J., dissenting

beas relief after similarly succinct evaluations of aggravating
factors. See, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. 30, 41–42
(2009) (per curiam) (discussing aggravators in one para-
graph); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 390–393 (2005) (no
discussion of aggravators); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,
534–538 (2003) (same). We can hardly fault the Ninth Cir-
cuit for using the same approach that this Court itself has
previously used.
   Thus, to me, the Court's claim that the Ninth Circuit “all
but ignored” the aggravators, ante, at 158, rings hollow.
And the majority's real critique does not appear to relate to
the Ninth Circuit's methodology. Rather, it merely takes
issue with the weight that the Ninth Circuit assigned to each
of the relevant facts. I agree with Justice Sotomayor that
we are not the right tribunal to parse the extensive factual
record in this case in the frst instance. Ante, p. 172 (dis-
senting opinion). That is doubly true where the Ninth Cir-
cuit committed no legal error in reviewing that record to

begin with. I respectfully dissent.
