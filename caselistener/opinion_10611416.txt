                ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
                     [October 16, 2024]

  The applications for stay presented to THE CHIEF
JUSTICE and by him referred to the Court are denied.
  JUSTICE THOMAS would grant the applications for stay.
  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or deci-
sion of these applications.
  Statement of JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, with whom JUSTICE
GORSUCH joins, respecting the denial of applications for
stay.
  In my view, the applicants have shown a strong likeli-
hood of success on the merits as to at least some of their

But because the applicants need not start compliance work

until June 2025, they are unlikely to suffer irreparable
harm before the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit de-
cides the merits. So this Court understandably denies the
stay applications for now. Given that the D. C. Circuit is
proceeding with dispatch, it should resolve the case in its
current term. After the D. C. Circuit decides the case, the
nonprevailing parties could, if circumstances warrant, seek
appropriate relief in this Court pending this Court’s dispo-
sition of any petition for certiorari, and if certiorari is
granted, the ultimate disposition of the case.
