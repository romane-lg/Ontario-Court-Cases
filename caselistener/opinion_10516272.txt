certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
                 the second circuit
       No. 22–49. Argued March 28, 2023—Decided June 16, 2023
A federal court imposing multiple prison sentences typically has discretion
  to run the sentences concurrently or consecutively. See 18 U. S. C.
  § 3584. An exception exists in § 924(c), which provides that “no term of
  imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall
  run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.” § 924(c)
  (1)(D)(ii). Here, the Court considers whether § 924(c)'s bar on concur-
  rent sentences extends to a sentence imposed under a different subsec-
  tion, § 924( j).
     Petitioner Efrain Lora was convicted of the federal crime of aiding
  and abetting a violation of § 924( j)(1), which penalizes “a person who, in
  the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person
  through the use of a frearm,” where “the killing is a murder.” A viola-
  tion of subsection (c) occurs when a person “uses or carries a frearm”
Page Proof Pending Publication
  “during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traffcking
  crime,” or “possesses a frearm” “in furtherance of any such crime.”
  § 924(c)(1)(A). Lora was also convicted of a second federal crime, con-
  spiring to distribute drugs.
     At sentencing, the District Court concluded that it lacked discretion
  to run the sentences for Lora's two convictions concurrently, because
  § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s bar on concurrent sentences governs § 924( j) sen-
  tences. The District Court sentenced Lora to consecutive terms of im-
  prisonment for the drug-distribution-conspiracy count and the § 924( j)
  count. The Court of Appeals affrmed.
Held: Section 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s bar on concurrent sentences does not govern
 a sentence for a § 924( j) conviction. A § 924( j) sentence therefore can
 run either concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence.
 Pp. 456–464.
    (a) Sections 924(c) and 924( j) criminalize the use, carrying, and pos-
 session of frearms in connection with certain crimes. Subsection (c)
 lays out a set of offenses and their corresponding penalties. It also
 mandates that a “term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this
 subsection” must run consecutively with other sentences. § 924(c)(1)
 (D)(ii). Subsection ( j) likewise lays out offense elements and corre-
 sponding penalties. Unlike subsection (c), subsection ( j) contains no
 consecutive-sentence mandate. Pp. 456–458.

                                  Syllabus

     (b) Subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence mandate applies only to
  the terms of imprisonment prescribed within subsection (c). A sen-
  tence imposed under subsection ( j) does not qualify. Subsection ( j) is
  located outside subsection (c) and does not call for imposing any sen-
  tence from subsection (c). And while subsection ( j) references subsec-
  tion (c), that reference is limited to offense elements, not penalties.
  Pp. 458–459.
     (c) Congress did not, as the Government maintains, incorporate
  § 924(c) as a whole into § 924( j) such that a § 924( j) defendant faces sub-
  section ( j)'s penalties plus subsection (c)'s penalties. Subsection ( j) no-
  where mentions—let alone incorporates—subsection (c)'s penalties.
  Moreover, as subsections (c) and ( j) are written, a sentencing court can-
  not always obey both sets of penalties. To avert potential confict be-
  tween subsections (c) and ( j), the Government points to another provi-
  sion, § 924(c)(5), as a model. But assuming without deciding whether
  § 924(c)(5) operates as the Government says, Congress did not im-
  plement that design in subsection ( j). Equally unavailing is the
  Government's argument that, under double jeopardy principles, a de-
  fendant cannot receive both subsection (c) and subsection ( j) sentences
  for the same conduct. That view of double jeopardy can easily be
  squared with the conclusion that subsection ( j) neither incorporates sub-
Page Proof Pending Publication
  section (c)'s penalties nor triggers the consecutive-sentence mandate.
  Pp. 459–462.
     (d) It is not “implausible,” as the Government asserts, for Congress
  to have imposed the harsh consecutive-sentence mandate under subsec-
  tion (c) but not subsection ( j), which covers more serious offense con-
  duct. That result is consistent with the statute's design. Unlike sub-
  section (c), subsection ( j) generally eschews mandatory penalties in
  favor of sentencing fexibility. Of a piece, subsection ( j) permits fexi-
  bility to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences. Con-
  gress chose a different approach to punishment in subsection ( j) than in
  subsection (c), and the Court must implement the design Congress
  chose. Pp. 462–464.

   Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the Court.
   When a federal court imposes multiple prison sentences,
it can typically choose whether to run the sentences concur-
rently or consecutively. See 18 U. S. C. § 3584. An excep-
tion exists in subsection (c) of § 924, which provides that “no
term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this sub-
section shall run concurrently with any other term of impris-
onment.” § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).
   In this case, we consider whether § 924(c)'s bar on concur-
rent sentences extends to a sentence imposed under a differ-
ent subsection: § 924( j). We hold that it does not. A sen-
tence for a § 924( j) conviction therefore can run either
concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence.

 In 2002, members                 Publication
                  a drug-dealing group from the Bronx
assassinated a rival drug dealer. The Government accused
petitioner Efrain Lora of being one of the group's leaders
and acting as a scout during the fatal shooting. After a jury
trial, Lora was convicted of aiding and abetting a violation
of § 924( j)(1), which penalizes “[a] person who, in the course
of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person
through the use of a frearm,” where “the killing is a mur-
der.” See also § 2(a) (an aider and abettor is punishable “as
a principal”). Lora was also convicted of conspiring to dis-
tribute drugs, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §§ 841 and 846.
   At sentencing, the District Court rejected two of Lora's
arguments about his § 924( j) conviction. Most pertinent

run the § 924( j) sentence concurrently with the drug-
distribution-conspiracy sentence. The District Court held it
lacked such discretion. Applying Circuit precedent, it held
that § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s bar on concurrent sentences governs
§ 924( j) sentences, such that Lora's two sentences had to run
consecutively. See United States v. Barrett, 937 F. 3d 126,
129, n. 2 (CA2 2019). Lora also argued that a § 924( j) con-
viction is not subject to the mandatory minimum sentences
specifed in § 924(c). Disagreeing once again, the District
Court applied the fve-year mandatory minimum under
§ 924(c)(1)(A) to Lora's sentencing calculation.
   The District Court ultimately sentenced Lora to 30 years
of imprisonment: 25 years on the drug-distribution-conspir-
acy count and—consecutively—fve years on the § 924( j)
count. Lora also received fve years of supervised release.
   The Court of Appeals affrmed, adhering to its precedent
barring § 924( j) sentences from running concurrently with
other sentences. That decision reinforced a confict among
Page Proof Pending Publication
the Courts of Appeals over whether § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s
concurrent-sentence bar governs § 924( j) sentences.1 We
granted certiorari to resolve the confict. 598 U. S. –––

  This case concerns federal laws that criminalize the use,
carrying, and possession of frearms in connection with cer-
tain crimes. The relevant parts of that scheme are spread
across two subsections of 18 U. S. C. § 924.

                          Opinion of the Court

   Subsection (c) lays out a set of offenses and their corre-
sponding penalties. It begins by making it a crime either
to “us[e] or carr[y] a frearm” “during and in relation to any
crime of violence or drug traffcking crime,” or to “posses[s] a
frearm” “in furtherance of any such crime.” § 924(c)(1)(A).
The provision then prescribes “a term of imprisonment” for
that offense: a minimum of fve years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).
   Other (more serious) offense elements and “term[s] of im-
prisonment” follow within subsection (c). If the frearm is
“brandished,” the “term of imprisonment” jumps to a mini-
mum of seven years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). If the frearm is “dis-
charged,” the minimum becomes 10 years; if the frearm is a
“machinegun,” 30 years; and so on. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)–(C), (c)(5).
   Subsection (c) also provides that “no term of imprisonment
imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concur-
rently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the
person.” § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). In other words, the sentence
Page Proof Pending Publication
must run consecutively, not concurrently, in relation to other
sentences. This concurrent-sentence bar (or consecutive-
sentence mandate) is at issue in this case.
   Subsection ( j) was added decades after subsection (c) and
its consecutive-sentence mandate.2 Subsection ( j) likewise
lays out offense elements and corresponding penalties. It
provides:
        “A person who, in the course of a violation of subsec-
     tion (c), causes the death of a person through the use of
     a frearm, shall—
        “(1) if the killing is a murder (as defned in section
     1111), be punished by death or by imprisonment for any
     term of years or for life; and

(adding subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence mandate in 1971); 108 Stat.
1973 (enacting subsection ( j), originally designated as subsection (i), in
1994); 110 Stat. 3505 (redesignating as subsection ( j) in 1996).

                        Opinion of the Court

         “(2) if the killing is manslaughter (as defned in section
      1112), be punished as provided in that section.”
      § 924( j).
Subsection ( j) contains no consecutive-sentence mandate.
                                 B
   Here, Lora was convicted of a subsection ( j) offense. The
parties dispute whether the sentence for that offense can run
concurrently with another sentence, or whether it is subject
to subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence mandate. We hold
the former.
   Subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence requirement applies
to a “term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this
subsection”—i. e., subsection (c). § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis
added). By those plain terms, Congress applied the
consecutive-sentence mandate only to terms of imprisonment
imposed under that subsection. And Congress put subsec-
Page Proof Pending Publication
tion ( j) in a different subsection of the statute.
   Drilling into the details confrms that straightforward rea-
soning. To begin, subsection (c) sets forth a host of offenses
and the corresponding “term[s] of imprisonment” to be im-
posed. §§ 924(c)(1), (5); supra, at 457. Those are the
“term[s] of imprisonment imposed . . . under this subsection”
that the consecutive-sentence mandate references.
§ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). That is, by echoing the phrase “term of
imprisonment” and referring inwards to “this subsection,”
§ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) points to the terms of imprisonment pre-
scribed within subsection (c).
   A sentence imposed under subsection ( j) does not qualify.
To state the obvious again, subsection ( j) is not located
within subsection (c). Nor does subsection ( j) call for im-
posing any sentence from subsection (c). Instead, subsec-
tion ( j) provides its own set of penalties. See §§ 924( j)(1)–(2).
   To be sure, subsection ( j) references subsection (c). But it
does so only with respect to offense elements, not penalties.
Subsection ( j)'s offense elements include causing death “in
                   Cite as: 599 U. S. 453 (2023)             459

                      Opinion of the Court

the course of a violation of subsection (c).” § 924( j). And to
defne that phrase, one must consult subsection (c)'s offense
elements (i. e., what it takes to violate that subsection). But
that is where subsection (c)'s role in subsection ( j) stops.
One need not consult subsection (c)'s sentences in order to
sentence a subsection ( j) defendant.
    Thus, a defendant who is sentenced under subsection
( j) does not receive a “term of imprisonment imposed . . .
under [subsection (c)].” Consequently, § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s
consecutive-sentence mandate does not apply.

                               III
                                A
   The Government tries to defect this conclusion by blend-
ing subsections (c) and ( j) together. It claims that “Con-
gress incorporated Section 924(c) as a whole into Section
924( j).” Brief for United States 15. Under that view, a
Page Proof Pending Publication
subsection ( j) defendant faces subsection ( j)'s penalties plus
subsection (c)'s penalties—including subsection (c)'s manda-
tory minimum sentences and its consecutive-sentence
mandate.
   The actual statute bears no resemblance to the Govern-
ment's vision. Subsection ( j) nowhere mentions—let alone
incorporates—subsection (c)'s penalties. Instead, as just ex-
plained, subsection ( j)'s only reference to subsection (c) is
limited to offense elements. Supra, at 458–459.
   Moreover, a sentencing court cannot follow both subsec-
tion (c) and subsection ( j) as written. Combining the two
subsections would set them on a collision course; indeed, in
some cases, the maximum sentence would be lower than the
minimum sentence. Take voluntary manslaughter using a
machinegun in the course of a subsection (c)(1) violation, for
example. Subsection (c), because of the machinegun, would
command that “the person shall be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of not less than 30 years.” § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii).
Subsection ( j), because of the voluntary manslaughter, would
460                  LORA v. UNITED STATES

                        Opinion of the Court

command that, per § 1112, the person “shall be . . . impris-
oned not more than 15 years.” §§ 924( j)(2), 1112(b). To
fashion a sentence “not less than 30 years” and “not more
than 15 years”—that is, to obey both subsections (c) and ( j)—
is impossible. And Congress has not required that unachiev-
able result. Instead, subsection ( j) supplies its own compre-
hensive set of penalties that apply instead of subsection (c)'s.
   To avert potential confict between subsections (c) and ( j),
the Government tries to knit the two provisions together in
a very particular way. In the Government's view, a court
sentencing a subsection ( j) defendant should jump to subsec-
tion (c), apply the penalties listed there, then jump back to
subsection ( j) and add the penalties listed there, then jump
back to subsection (c) and impose the consecutive-sentence
mandate listed in that subsection. But nothing in subsec-
tion ( j) calls for such calisthenics.
   To assuage that concern, the Government maintains that
Congress has done this elsewhere; it says that another provi-
Page Proof Pending Publication
sion, § 924(c)(5), operates this way. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 31.
Even if § 924(c)(5) does work in that fashion—which we do
not decide—the Government's argument only underscores
that subsection ( j) does not.
   Under § 924(c)(5), a person who, inter alia, uses armor
piercing ammunition during and in relation to a crime of vio-
lence or drug traffcking crime:
         “shall . . .
         “(A) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not
      less than 15 years; and
         “(B) if death results from the use of such
      ammunition—
         “(i) if the killing is murder (as defned in section 1111),
      be punished by death or sentenced to a term of impris-
      onment for any term of years or for life; and
         “(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as defned in sec-
      tion 1112), be punished as provided in section 1112.”
      (Emphasis added.)
                   Cite as: 599 U. S. 453 (2023)            461

                      Opinion of the Court

According to the Government, § 924(c)(5) adds two penalties
together when death results: Someone convicted of murder
resulting from the use of such ammunition faces a 15-year
mandatory minimum sentence under § 924(c)(5)(A) plus an
additional sentence for murder under § 924(c)(5)(B)(i). Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27, 31.
    But subsection ( j) is cast from a different mold. Section
924(c)(5) groups the two penalties together and joins them
with the word “and.” In contrast, several unrelated subsec-
tions separate subsections (c) and ( j) structurally, and noth-
ing joins their penalties textually. So even if those features
of § 924(c)(5) make it operate as the Government contends,
those aspects of § 924(c)(5) are missing from subsection ( j).
    In the Government's own telling, then, § 924(c)(5) shows
how Congress could have constructed penalties that might
ultimately add together. Yet Congress did not implement
that design in subsection ( j).
Page Proof Pending Publication
    Equally unavailing is the Government's invocation of dou-
ble jeopardy principles. According to the Government's
brief, “Section 924( j) amounts to the `same offense' as Sec-
tion 924(c) for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause,” so
“a defendant may be punished for either a Section 924(c) of-
fense or a Section 924( j) offense, but not both.” Brief for
United States 22–26 (emphasis added; alterations and some
internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues
that this conception of double jeopardy confrms subsection
( j) incorporates all of subsection (c). Ibid.
    We express no position on the Government's view of dou-
ble jeopardy, because even assuming it, arguendo, the Gov-
ernment's view does not refute our holding on the question
presented. The Government says someone cannot receive
both subsection (c) and subsection ( j) sentences for the same
conduct. But that aligns with our conclusion here: If a de-
fendant receives a sentence under subsection ( j), he does not
receive a sentence “imposed . . . under [subsection (c)]” that
would trigger the consecutive-sentence mandate. § 924(c)(1)
462                   LORA v. UNITED STATES

                          Opinion of the Court

(D)(ii). Accordingly, the Government's view of double jeop-
ardy can easily be squared with our view that subsection ( j)
neither incorporates subsection (c)'s penalties nor triggers
the consecutive-sentence mandate.
                                B
   The Government protests that it is “implausible” that Con-
gress imposed the harsh consecutive-sentence mandate
under subsection (c) but not subsection ( j), which covers
more serious offense conduct. Brief for United States 9, 28–
35. Yet that result is consistent with other design features
of the statute.
   Congress plainly chose a different approach to punishment
in subsection ( j) than in subsection (c). Subsection (c), frst
enacted in 1968, is full of mandatory penalties. It contains
mandatory minimum years of imprisonment and mandatory
consecutive sentences. In fact, when subsection ( j) was
enacted in 1994, subsection (c) specifed not just mandatory
Page Proof Pending Publication
minimums, but exact mandatory terms of imprisonment. 18
U. S. C. § 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (e. g., exactly fve years of im-
prisonment for the base subsection (c) offense).
   Subsection ( j), by contrast, generally eschews mandatory
penalties in favor of sentencing fexibility. Unlike subsec-
tion (c), subsection ( j) contains no mandatory minimums.
Even for murder, subsection ( j) expressly permits a sentence
of “any term of years.” § 924( j)(1) (emphasis added). This
follows the same pattern as several other provisions enacted
alongside subsection ( j) in the Federal Death Penalty Act of
1994, 108 Stat. 1959. In those provisions, as in § 924( j)(1),
Congress authorized the death penalty, but also a fexible
range of lesser sentences for “any term of years,” with no
mandatory minimum or consecutive-sentence mandate.3 In
the same law, Congress also enacted a provision allowing

   108 Stat. 1971–1973, 1976, 1978–1982 (Pub. L. 103–322, §§ 60008, 60010,
60011, 60019–60024).

                           Opinion of the Court

judges to go below the otherwise-mandatory minimum sen-
tence in certain cases.4 Given those choices to favor sen-
tencing fexibility over mandatory penalties, it is not “im-
plausible,” as the Government asserts, that subsection ( j)
permits fexibility to choose between concurrent and consec-
utive sentences.
   Nor is that fexibility incompatible with the seriousness of
subsection ( j) offenses. Subsection ( j) merely refects the
seriousness of the offense using a different approach than
subsection (c)'s mandatory penalties. For murder, subsec-
tion ( j) authorizes the harshest maximum penalty possible:
death. § 924( j)(1). And for manslaughter, subsection ( j)
imposes the same harsh punishment that the Federal Crimi-
nal Code prescribes for other manslaughters. See
§ 924( j)(2) (aligning penalties with § 1112).5
   Congress could certainly have designed the penalty
scheme at issue here differently. It could have mandated
harsher punishment under subsection ( j) than under subsec-
Page Proof Pending Publication
tion (c). It could have added a consecutive-sentence man-
date to subsection ( j). It could have written subsection (c)'s
consecutive-sentence mandate more broadly. It could have
placed subsection ( j) within subsection (c).6

§ 3553(f)).

     When Congress enacted subsection ( j), it actually imposed higher max-
imum penalties for manslaughter under subsection ( j) than what subsec-
tion (c) had authorized for the base offense. A base subsection (c) viola-
tion triggered a fxed fve-year sentence, while subsection ( j)(2) authorized
more: up to 10 years for voluntary manslaughter and six years for involun-
tary manslaughter. 18 U. S. C. §§ 924(c)(1), (i)(2), 1112 (1994 ed.); see 110
Stat. 3505 (redesignating subsection (i) as subsection ( j)). This reinforces
that Congress designed subsection ( j)'s penalties to account for the seri-
ousness of the offense by themselves, without incorporating penalties from
subsection (c).

     Congress specifcally considered and rejected that last possibility.
The 1994 Congress had before it a proposal to add, within subsection (c),
a provision authorizing the death penalty when a subsection (c) violation

  Because the consecutive-sentence mandate in § 924(c)(1)
(D)(ii) does not govern § 924( j) sentences, the District Court
had discretion to impose Lora's § 924( j) sentence concur-
rently with another sentence. We vacate the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion.

that option and enacted a different version of that crime bill—which cre-
