SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
        JEFFREY CLYDE PITTS v. MISSISSIPPI
  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
                 COURT OF MISSISSIPPI
            No. 24–1159.   Decided November 24, 2025

  PER CURIAM.
  Ordinarily, the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause
“guarantees the defendant a face-to-face meeting with wit-
nesses appearing before the trier of fact.” Coy v. Iowa, 487
U. S. 1012, 1016 (1988). In child-abuse cases, however, that
rule sometimes gives way. Consistent with the Sixth
Amendment, a court may screen a child witness from the
defendant when “necessary to protect [the child] from
trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical
presence of the defendant, at least where such trauma
would impair the child’s ability to communicate.” Mary-
land v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 857 (1990).
  Still, before invoking this procedure, a court must pro-
ceed with care. It must “hear evidence” and make a “case-
specific” finding of “[t]he requisite . . . necessity.” Id., at
855. Simply pointing to a state statute that authorizes
screening, even one premised on “generalized finding[s]” of
necessity, will not suffice. Coy, 487 U. S., at 1021. Because
the Mississippi Supreme Court departed from these princi-
ples, we reverse.
                                I
  In May 2020, A. G. C. spent a weekend visiting her fa-
ther, Jeffrey Pitts. After returning home, A. G. C. told her
mother that she had been sexually abused. Eventually,
that report led to criminal charges against Pitts.
  At trial, the State moved for permission to place a screen
between A. G. C. and Pitts when she took the witness
stand. In support of its motion, the State pointed to a
2                    PITTS v. MISSISSIPPI

                          Per Curiam

Mississippi statute providing that child witnesses “shall
have the . . . righ[t]” to “a properly constructed screen that
would permit the judge and jury in the courtroom . . . to see
the child but would obscure the child’s view of the defend-
ant.” Miss. Code Ann. §99–43–101(2)(g) (2020).
   Pitts objected. He did not question the statute’s manda-
tory terms. But, he said, those terms had to give way to the
Sixth Amendment’s demands. 405 So. 3d 20, 31 (Miss. App.
2023). And, he submitted, the State had not attempted to
meet, and could not meet, its Sixth Amendment burden of
showing that screening was necessary in the particular cir-
cumstances of his case. 405 So. 3d 1238, 1243 (Miss. 2025).
   The trial judge granted the State’s motion. In doing so,
the judge reasoned that the “statute . . . appears to be man-
datory,” and expressed “concerns about [his] ability to de-
clare the statute unconstitutional and fail to follow it.” App.
to Pet. for Cert. 36a (App.).
   After a jury convicted him, Pitts appealed. 405 So. 3d, at
31. Invoking Coy and Craig, he argued that the trial court
had failed to make the case-specific finding of necessity the
Sixth Amendment requires and, as remedy, sought a new
trial. 405 So. 3d, at 31–35.
   Ultimately, a divided Mississippi Supreme Court rejected
Pitts’s arguments. The court did not dispute that the trial
court failed to make a case-specific finding of necessity. See
405 So. 3d, at 1246. Instead, the court sought to distinguish
Coy and Craig on various grounds. 405 So. 3d, at 1248–
1252. With those distinctions in hand, the court then pro-
ceeded to hold that Mississippi’s mandatory statute pro-
vided sufficient authority for the screening in this case. Id.,
at 1254–1255. Unpersuaded, a dissent argued that Coy and
Craig controlled this case and that the trial court failed to
comply with their terms. 405 So. 3d, at 1255 (King, J., dis-
senting).
   After the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled, Pitts sought
certiorari.

                               II
   Under Coy and Craig, a trial court may not deny a de-
fendant his Sixth Amendment right to meet his accusers
face to face simply because a state statute permits screen-
ing. Nor may a court authorize screening based on “gener-
alized finding[s]” of necessity underlying such a statute.
Coy, 487 U. S., at 1021. Instead, the Sixth Amendment tol-
erates screening in child-abuse cases only if a court “hear[s]
evidence” and issues a “case-specific” finding of “[t]he req-
uisite . . . necessity.” See Craig, 497 U. S., at 855. The Mis-
sissippi Supreme Court attempted to avoid these con-
straints by distinguishing Coy and Craig in various ways.
But none of the court’s distinctions persuades. Consider the
most salient theories it pressed:
   First, the court pointed to a victims’ rights provision in
Mississippi’s State Constitution. 405 So. 3d, at 1246–1249.
That provision affords the state legislature the power “to
enact . . . laws to . . . protect the rights guaranteed to vic-
tims.” Art. 3, §26A(3). And, the court observed, the state
legislature exercised this power when it adopted the man-
datory screening law the trial court applied in this case.
405 So. 3d, at 1249. But, true as all that may be, it is also
irrelevant. When state law conflicts with the Federal Con-
stitution, the latter controls. Art. VI, cl. 2. And under the
Sixth Amendment, neither state screening statutes, nor the
“generalized finding[s]” on which they are premised, are
enough to overcome a defendant’s right to face-to-face con-
frontation. Coy, 487 U. S., at 1021.
   Second, the court stressed that Mississippi’s statute man-
dates screening in child-abuse cases while the Iowa statute
in Coy only afforded trial courts discretion to screen. 405
So. 3d, at 1249–1250. But, if anything, the fact that Mis-
sissippi’s statute is mandatory—and thus never requires a
case-specific finding of necessity—renders it “more
4                    PITTS v. MISSISSIPPI

                          Per Curiam

constitutionally problematic than the statute at issue in
Coy, not less so.” Id., at 1258 (King, J., dissenting).
  Third, the court emphasized that A. G. C. was four years
old at the time of trial. Id., at 1250 (majority opinion). But
Craig involved a 6-year-old witness. 497 U. S., at 840. And
though a witness’s age is a relevant consideration, Craig
made plain that a court must “hear evidence” and make a
“case-specific” “finding of necessity” before denying a de-
fendant the right to face-to-face confrontation in a child-
abuse case. See id., at 855.
  Fourth, the court observed that in Coy the government
and the defendant disputed who committed the alleged as-
sault, while in this case the identity of the alleged perpetra-
tor was not in question. 405 So. 3d, at 1250. But the Sixth
Amendment right to confront one’s accusers face to face
does not only apply in cases where identity is at issue. See
Craig, 497 U. S., at 840 (involving a known perpetrator).
Nor does Craig’s exception for child-abuse cases automati-
cally apply just because identity happens to be uncontested.
See id., at 855–856.
  Finally, the court noted that the child witness and law-
yers in Craig were placed in a different room from the de-
fendant, with cross-examination conducted over closed-cir-
cuit television. 405 So. 3d, at 1251. In this case, by
contrast, everyone remained in the courtroom, the witness
and defendant separated only by a screen. Id., at 1244,
1251. But both approaches deviate from the Sixth Amend-
ment’s usual rule that a defendant is entitled to meet his
accusers “face to face.” See Coy, 487 U. S., at 1016; Craig,
497 U. S., at 844. And both thus require a case-specific find-
ing of necessity. Id., at 855.
  Before this Court, the State does not so much defend the
Mississippi Supreme Court’s various efforts to distinguish
Coy and Craig as press a different argument still. As the
State sees it, the trial court did “hear evidence” and make
                   Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2025)              5

                            Per Curiam

a “case-specific” “finding of necessity.” See Craig, 497 U. S.,
at 855.
   We disagree. At trial, to be sure, the prosecution repre-
sented that A. G. C.’s guardian believed it would be difficult
for her to testify face to face with her father. App. 6a. But
the prosecution expressly rejected the notion that it had “to
put on any proof,” choosing to rely instead on Mississippi’s
mandatory “right” to screening. Id., at 6a–7a. And the trial
judge proceeded to rule that the “statute . . . appears to be
mandatory” and expressed concerns about “fail[ing] to fol-
low it.” Id., at 36a. Those arguments and conclusions fall
well short of the procedures and findings Coy and Craig re-
quire.
                                III
   Having resolved that much, we pause to underscore what
we leave unresolved. Just because a constitutional error
took place at trial does not necessarily mean a new one
must be held. Even constitutional errors are sometimes
subject to a “harmless-error” rule and do not require a new
trial if the prosecution can show “beyond a reasonable doubt
that the error complained of did not contribute to the ver-
dict obtained.” Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 23–24
(1967). This Court has held that the denial of the right to
face-to-face confrontation is among those errors “subject to
that harmless-error analysis.” Coy, 487 U. S., at 1021. Ac-
cordingly, on remand the State remains free to argue, and
the Mississippi Supreme Court remains free to consider,
whether the error in this case warrants a new trial under
the harmless-error standard.
   The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the
Mississippi Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is re-
manded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
                                                It is so ordered.
