  A.A.R.P., ET AL. v. DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT
            OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL.
                ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION
                              [April 19, 2025]

   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, dis-
senting.
   Shortly after midnight yesterday, the Court hastily and
prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief. Pro-
ceeding under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651, the
Court ordered “[t]he Government” not to remove a “putative
class of detainees” until this Court issues a superseding or-
der. 604 U. S. ___ (2025). Although the order does not de-
fine the “putative class,” it appears that the Court means
all members of the class that the habeas petitioners sought
to have certified, namely, “[a]ll noncitizens in custody in the
Northern District of Texas who were, are, or will be subject
to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘In-
vocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion
of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its imple-
mentation.”* Motion for Class Certification in No. 1:25–cv–
59 (ND Tex., Apr. 16, 2025), ECF Doc. 3, p. 1. And although
the Court does not specify what it means by “[t]he Govern-
ment,” it appears that the term is intended to embrace all
the named defendants, including the President. Cf. Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 65(d)(2).

   *It appears that the applicants have recently moved to amend their
class petition for habeas corpus and their motion for class certification.
See Motions in No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., Apr. 18, 2025), ECF No. 35. So
it is not clear if the applicants will continue to defend this specific defi-
nition or will argue for a new one.
2                      A.A.R.P. v. TRUMP

                       ALITO, J., dissenting

The Court did all this even though:
     It is not clear that the Court had jurisdiction. The
       All Writs Act does not provide an independent grant
       of jurisdiction. See 28 U. S. C. §1651(a) (permitting
       writs “necessary or appropriate in aid of ” a court’s
       jurisdiction); Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U. S. 529,
       534–535 (1999) (“the express terms” of the All Writs
       Act “confine the power of [a court] to issuing process
       ‘in aid of ’ its existing statutory jurisdiction; the Act
       does not enlarge that jurisdiction” (quoting
       §1651(a)). Therefore, this Court had jurisdiction
       only if the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the
       applicants’ appeal, see §1254 (granting this Court
       jurisdiction to review “[c]ases in the courts of ap-
       peals”), and the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction
       only if the supposed order that the applicants ap-
       pealed amounted to the denial of a preliminary in-
       junction. See §1292(a)(1). But here, the “order” that
       applicants appealed was what they viewed as the
       District Court’s “ ‘constructive’ ” denial of their re-
       quest for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Or-
       der in No. 1:25–cv–59 (ND Tex., Apr. 18, 2025), ECF
       Doc. 41, p. 4 (ECF Doc. 41). That is, the District
       Court did not actually deny their most recent re-
       quest for a TRO, but they inferred that it was con-
       structively denied because the District Court failed
       to rule on that request before the expiration of a
       truncated counsel-imposed deadline. See Order in
       No. 25–10534 (CA5, Apr. 18, 2025), p. 3 (Ramirez, J.,
       concurring). The denial of a true TRO is not appeal-
       able, and here, it is not clear that the applicants’
       TRO request was actually denied. Indeed, in an or-
       der issued last night, the Fifth Circuit held that it
       lacked jurisdiction for this reason. See id., at 1

                  ALITO, J., dissenting

   (per curiam); see also id., at 3 (Ramirez, J., concur-
   ring).
 It is questionable whether the applicants complied
   with the general obligation to seek emergency in-
   junctive relief in the District Court before asking for
   such relief from an appellate court. Fed. Rules App.
   Proc. 8(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(C). When the applicants re-
   quested such relief in the District Court, they in-
   sisted on a ruling within 45 minutes on Good Friday
   afternoon, and when the District Court did not act
   within 133 minutes, they filed a notice of appeal,
   which the District Court held deprived it of jurisdic-
   tion. See ECF Doc. 41, at 3–4. It is doubtful that
   this aborted effort satisfied Federal Rule of Appel-
   late Procedure 8(a)(1)(C).
 When this Court rushed to enter its order, the Court
  of Appeals was considering the issue of emergency
  relief, and we were informed that a decision would
  be forthcoming. This Court, however, refused to
  wait. But under this Court’s Rule 23.3, “[e]xcept in
  the most extraordinary circumstances, an applica-
  tion for a stay will not be entertained unless the re-
  lief requested was first sought in the appropriate
  court or courts below or from a judge or judges
  thereof.”
 The only papers before this Court were those submit-
  ted by the applicants. The Court had not ordered or
  received a response by the Government regarding ei-
  ther the applicants’ factual allegations or any of the
  legal issues presented by the application. And the
  Court did not have the benefit of a Government re-
  sponse filed in any of the lower courts either. When
  the applicants first raised their allegations in the
  District Court, that court provided the Government
4                     A.A.R.P. v. TRUMP

                      ALITO, J., dissenting

       with 24 hours to respond, and was poised to rule ex-
       peditiously. See ECF Doc. 41, at 3–4. But the Dis-
       trict Court dissolved the Government’s obligation to
       respond after counsel for applicants filed their hasty
       appeal which, in the District Court’s view, deprived
       it of jurisdiction to rule. Id., at 4–5.
     The papers before us, while alleging that the appli-
      cants were in imminent danger of removal, provided
      little concrete support for that allegation. Members
      of this Court have repeatedly insisted that an All
      Writs Act injunction pending appeal may only be
      granted when, among other things, “the legal rights
      at issue are indisputably clear and, even then, spar-
      ingly and only in the most critical and exigent cir-
      cumstances.” South Bay United Pentecostal Church
      v. Newsom, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (ROBERTS, C. J.,
      concurring in denial of application for injunctive re-
      lief ) (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omit-
      ted) (quoting S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E.
      Hartnett, D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice
      §17.4, p. 17–9 (11th ed. 2019)); see also Hobby Lobby
      Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 568 U. S. 1401, 1403 (2012)
      (SOTOMAYOR, J., in chambers); Lux v. Rodrigues,
      561 U. S. 1306, 1307 (2010) (ROBERTS, C. J., in
      chambers).
     Although this Court did not hear directly from the
      Government regarding any planned deportations
      under the Alien Enemies Act in this matter, an at-
      torney representing the Government in a different
      matter, J. G. G. v. Trump, No. 1:25–cv–766 (DC), in-
      formed the District Court in that case during a hear-
      ing yesterday evening that no such deportations
      were then planned to occur either yesterday, April
      18, or today, April 19.
     Although the Court provided class-wide relief, the
                 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            5

                     ALITO, J., dissenting

       District Court never certified a class, and this Court
       has never held that class relief may be sought in a
       habeas proceeding.
  In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court is-
sued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without
giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing
from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the
application, with dubious factual support for its order, and
without providing any explanation for its order. I refused
to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to
think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at
midnight was necessary or appropriate.
  Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation
to follow the law. The Executive must proceed under the
terms of our order in Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___ (2025)
(per curiam), and this Court should follow established pro-
cedures.
