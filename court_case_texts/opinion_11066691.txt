  MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP. et al. v.
        MOAB PARTNERS, L. P., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
                 the second circuit
    No. 22–1165. Argued January 16, 2024—Decided April 12, 2024
Petitioner Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation owns a subsidiary that
  operates terminals to store bulk liquid commodities, including No. 6 fuel
  oil, a byproduct of the refning process with a typical sulfur content
  close to 3%. In 2016, the United Nations' International Maritime Orga-
  nization formally adopted IMO 2020, a regulation capping the sulfur
  content of fuel oil used in shipping at 0.5% by 2020. In the ensuing
  years, Macquarie did not discuss IMO 2020 in its public offering docu-
  ments. In February 2018, however, Macquarie announced a drop in the
  amount of storage contracted for use by its subsidiary due in part to the
  decline in the No. 6 fuel oil market. Macquarie's stock price fell 41%.
     In response, Moab Partners, L. P., sued Macquarie and various offcer
  defendants. Moab alleged, among other things, that Macquarie vio-
Page Proof Pending Publication
  lated Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5(b)—which makes
  it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling
  securities when that omission renders “statements made” misleading—
  because it had a duty to disclose the IMO 2020 information under Item
  303 of SEC Regulation S–K. Item 303 requires companies to disclose
  “known trends or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably
  likely to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales
  or revenues or income from continuing operations” in periodic flings
  with the SEC. 17 CFR § 229.303(b)(2)(ii). The District Court dis-
  missed Moab's complaint. The Second Circuit reversed, concluding in
  part that Moab's allegations concerning the likely material effect of IMO
  2020 gave rise to a duty to disclose under Item 303, and Macquarie's
  Item 303 violation alone could sustain Moab's § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5
  claim. See 2022 WL 17815767, *1–*2.
Held: Pure omissions are not actionable under Rule 10b–5(b). Rule 10b–
 5(b) makes it unlawful “[t]o make any untrue statement of a material
 fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
 statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
 were made, not misleading.” 17 CFR § 240.10b–5(b). In addition to
 prohibiting “any untrue statement of a material fact”—i.e., false state-
 ments or lies—the Rule also prohibits omitting a material fact necessary
 “to make the statements made . . . not misleading.” Ibid. This case

                   MOAB PARTNERS, L. P.
                          Syllabus

  turns on whether this second prohibition bars only half-truths or instead
  extends to pure omissions.
     A pure omission occurs when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances
  that do not give any special signifcance to that silence. Half-truths, on
  the other hand, are “representations that state the truth only so far
  as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying information.” Universal
  Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 188.
  Rule 10b–5(b) requires disclosure of information necessary to ensure
  that statements already made are clear and complete. Logically and
  by its plain text, Rule 10b–5(b) therefore covers half-truths, not pure
  omissions, because it requires identifying affrmative assertions (i.e.,
  “statements made”) before determining if other facts are needed to
  make those statements “not misleading.”
     Statutory context confrms what the text plainly provides. Section
  11(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits any registration statement
  that “omit[s] to state a material fact required to be stated therein.” 15
  U. S. C. § 77k(a). By its terms, § 11(a) creates liability for failure to
  speak. Neither § 10(b) nor Rule 10b–5(b) contains language similar to
  § 11(a), and that omission is telling.
     “Silence, absent a duty to disclose, is not misleading under Rule
  10b–5.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 239, n. 17. A duty to
Page Proof Pending Publication
  disclose, however, does not automatically render silence misleading
  under Rule 10b–5(b). The failure to disclose information required by
  Item 303 can support a Rule 10b–5(b) claim only if the omission renders
  affrmative statements made misleading. Moab and the United States
  suggest that a plaintiff does not need to plead any statements rendered
  misleading by a pure omission because reasonable investors know that
  the Exchange Act requires issuers to fle periodic informational state-
  ments in which companies must furnish the information required by
  Item 303. But that argument reads the words “statements made” out
  of Rule 10b–5(b) and shifts the focus of that Rule and § 10(b) from fraud
  to disclosure. See Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 234–235
  (“Section 10(b) is aptly described as a catchall provision, but what it
  catches must be fraud”). Moab also contends that without private lia-
  bility for pure omissions under Rule 10b–5(b), there will be “broad im-
  munity any time an issuer fraudulently omits information Congress and
  the SEC require it to disclose.” Brief for Respondent Moab Partners
  1. But private parties remain free to bring claims based on Item 303
  violations that create misleading half-truths, and the SEC retains au-
  thority to prosecute violations of its own rules and regulations, includ-
  ing Item 303. Pp. 263–266.

260        MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP. v.
                 MOAB PARTNERS, L. P.
                   Opinion of the Court

in this case is whether the failure to disclose information
required by Item 303 can support a private action under
Rule 10b–5(b), even if the failure does not render any “state-
ments made” misleading. The Court holds that it cannot.
Pure omissions are not actionable under Rule 10b–5(b).

                               I
                               A
   Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes
it “unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ, in connec-
tion with the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any manip-
ulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention
of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.”
48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. § 78j(b). Rule 10b–5 implements
this prohibition and makes it unlawful for issuers of regis-
tered securities to “make any untrue statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
Page Proof Pending Publication
make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.” 17 CFR
§ 240.10b–5(b) (2022). This Court “has found a right of ac-
tion implied in the words of [§ 10(b)] and its implementing
regulation. ” Stoner idge Investment Partners, LLC v.
Scientifc-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157 (2008).
   Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to fle
periodic informational statements. See 15 U. S. C. §§ 78m(a)
(1), 78l(b)(1). These statements include the “Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results
of Operations” (MD&A), in which companies must “[f]urnish
the information required by Item 303 of Regulation S–K.”
See SEC Form 10–K; SEC Form 10–Q. Item 303, in turn,
requires companies to “[d]escribe any known trends or un-
certainties that have had or that are reasonably likely to
have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales
or revenues or income from continuing operations.” 17
CFR § 229.303(b)(2)(ii) (2022).

                      Opinion of the Court

                                B
   Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation owns infrastructure-
related businesses, including a subsidiary that operates large
“bulk liquid storage terminals” within the United States.
These terminals handle and store liquid commodities, such as
petroleum, biofuels, chemicals, and oil products. One liquid
commodity stored in these terminals is No. 6 fuel oil, a high-
sulfur fuel oil that is a byproduct of the refning process. In
2016, the United Nations' International Maritime Organiza-
tion formally adopted IMO 2020, a regulation that capped
the sulfur content of fuel oil used in shipping at 0.5% by the
beginning of 2020. No. 6 fuel oil typically has a sulfur con-
tent closer to 3%. In the ensuing years, Macquarie did not
discuss IMO 2020 in its public offering documents. In Feb-
ruary 2018, however, Macquarie announced that the amount
of storage capacity contracted for use by its subsidiary's cus-
tomers had dropped in part because of the structural decline
Page Proof Pending Publication
in the No. 6 fuel oil market. Macquarie's stock price fell
around 41%.
   Moab Partners, L. P. sued Macquarie and various offcer
defendants, alleging, among other things, a violation of
§ 10(b) and Rule 10b–5. The crux of Moab's argument was
that Macquarie's public statements “were false and mislead-
ing” because it “concealed from investors that [its subsid-
iary's] single largest product . . . was No. 6 fuel oil,” which
“faced a near-cataclysmic ban on the bulk of its worldwide
use through IMO 2020.” City of Riviera Beach Gen. Em-
ployees Retirement System v. Macquarie Infrastructure
Corp., 2021 WL 4084572, *6 (SDNY, Sept. 7, 2021) (internal
quotation marks omitted). In Moab's view, Macquarie had
“ `a duty to disclose' the extent to which [its subsidiary's]
storage capacity was devoted to No. 6 fuel oil,” ibid., but
instead, Macquarie “violated disclosure obligations under
Item 303,” id., at *10, and therefore violated § 10(b) and Rule
10b–5. The District Court dismissed Moab's complaint,

                   MOAB PARTNERS, L. P.
                     Opinion of the Court

concluding in relevant part that Moab had not “actually
plead[ed] an uncertainty that should have been disclosed” or
“in what SEC fling or flings Defendants were supposed to
disclose it.” Ibid.
   The Second Circuit reversed. The court reasoned that
there are “two circumstances which impose a duty on a cor-
poration to disclose omitted facts.” 2022 WL 17815767, *1
(Dec. 20, 2022). First, a duty arises when there is “ ` “a stat-
ute or regulation requiring disclosure,” ' . . . such as Ite[m]
303.” Ibid. (quoting Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley,
776 F. 3d 94, 101 (CA2 2015)). Second, “[e]ven when there
is no existing independent duty to disclose information, once
a company speaks on an issue or topic, there is a duty to tell
the whole truth.” 2022 WL 17815767, *1 (internal quotation
marks omitted). “Crediting [Moab's] allegations as true,
IMO 2020's signifcant restriction of No. 6 fuel oil use was
known to [Macquarie] and reasonably likely to have material
effects on [Macquarie's] fnancial condition or results of oper-
Page Proof Pending Publication
ation.” Id., at *3. Because Moab had “adequately alleged
a `known trend[ ] or uncertaint[y]' that gave rise to a duty to
disclose under Item 303,” id., at *2 (alterations in original),
the court applied its binding precedent to conclude that Mac-
quarie's Item 303 violation alone could sustain Moab's § 10(b)
and Rule 10b–5 claim. See ibid. (“The failure to make a
material disclosure required by Item 303 can serve as the
basis . . . for a claim under Section 10(b)”).
   The courts of appeals disagree on whether a failure to
make a disclosure required by Item 303 can support a private
claim under § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5(b) in the absence of
an otherwise-misleading statement.1 This Court granted

   Rule 10b–5(b) makes it unlawful “[t]o make any untrue
statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.” 17 CFR § 240.10b–5(b). This Rule accom-
plishes two things. It prohibits “any untrue statement of a
material fact”—i.e., false statements or lies. Ibid. It also
prohibits omitting a material fact necessary “to make the
statements made . . . not misleading.” Ibid. This case
turns on whether this second prohibition bars only half-
truths or instead extends to pure omissions.
   A pure omission occurs when a speaker says nothing, in
circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to
that silence. Take the simplest example. If a company fails
Page Proof Pending Publication
entirely to fle an MD&A, then the omission of particular
information required in the MD&A has no special signif-
cance because no information was disclosed. Half-truths, on
the other hand, are “representations that state the truth only
so far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying informa-
tion.” Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States
ex rel. Escobar, 579 U. S. 176, 188 (2016); see also Omnicare,
Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Industry Pension
Fund, 575 U. S. 175, 192 (2015) (“[L]iteral accuracy is not
enough: An issuer must as well desist from misleading inves-
tors by saying one thing and holding back another”). “A
classic example of an actionable half-truth in contract law is
the seller who reveals that there may be two new roads near
a property he is selling, but fails to disclose that a third po-
tential road might bisect the property.” Universal Health

tion of a violation of the disclosure requirements of Item 303 does not lead
inevitably to the conclusion that such disclosure would be required under
Rule 10b–5. Such a duty to disclose must be separately shown' ”).
264        MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP. v.
                 MOAB PARTNERS, L. P.
                   Opinion of the Court

Services, 579 U. S., at 188–189. In other words, the differ-
ence between a pure omission and a half-truth is the differ-
ence between a child not telling his parents he ate a whole
cake and telling them he had dessert.
   Rule 10b–5(b) does not proscribe pure omissions. The
Rule prohibits omitting material facts necessary to make the
“statements made . . . not misleading.” Put differently, it
requires disclosure of information necessary to ensure that
statements already made are clear and complete (i.e., that
the dessert was, in fact, a whole cake). This Rule therefore
covers half-truths, not pure omissions. Logically and by its
plain text, the Rule requires identifying affrmative asser-
tions (i.e., “statements made”) before determining if other
facts are needed to make those statements “not misleading.”
See, e.g., 6 Oxford English Dictionary 857 (1933) (def. 3) (de-
fning “statement” as a “written or oral communication set-
ting forth facts, arguments, demands, or the like”); Webster's
Page Proof Pending Publication
New International Dictionary 2461 (2d ed. 1942) (defning
“statement” as the “[a]ct of stating, reciting, or presenting,
orally or on paper”). It once again “bears emphasis that
§ 10(b) and Rule 10b–5(b) do not create an affrmative duty
to disclose any and all material information. Disclosure is
required under these provisions only when necessary `to
make . . . statements made, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.' ” Matrixx
Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. 27, 44 (2011) (quot-
ing Rule 10b–5(b)).
   Statutory context confrms what the text plainly provides.
Congress imposed liability for pure omissions in § 11(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933. Section 11(a) prohibits any registra-
tion statement that “contain[s] an untrue statement of a ma-
terial fact or omit[s] to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.” 15 U. S. C. § 77k(a). By its terms, in addi-
tion to proscribing lies and half-truths, this section also cre-
ates liability for failure to speak on a subject at all. See

                      Opinion of the Court

Omnicare, 575 U. S., at 186, n. 3 (“Section 11's omissions
clause also applies when an issuer fails to make mandated
disclosures—those `required to be stated'—in a registration
statement”). There is no similar language in § 10(b) or Rule
10b–5(b). Cf. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185,
208 (1976) (“The express recognition of a cause of action
premised on negligent behavior in § 11 stands in sharp con-
trast to the language of § 10(b)”). Neither Congress in
§ 10(b) nor the SEC in Rule 10b–5(b) mirrored § 11(a) to cre-
ate liability for pure omissions. That omission (unlike a
pure omission) is telling. Cf. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor
Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 734 (1975) (“When Congress
wished to provide a remedy . . . it had little trouble in doing
so expressly”).
   “Silence, absent a duty to disclose, is not misleading under
Rule 10b–5.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 239,
n. 17 (1988). Even a duty to disclose, however, does not au-
Page Proof Pending Publication
tomatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b–5(b).
Today, this Court confrms that the failure to disclose infor-
mation required by Item 303 can support a Rule 10b–5(b)
claim only if the omission renders affrmative statements
made misleading.
   Moab and the United States suggest that a plaintiff does
not need to plead any statements rendered misleading by a
pure omission because reasonable investors know that Item
303 requires an MD&A to disclose all known trends and un-
certainties. That argument fails, however, because it reads
the words “statements made” out of Rule 10b–5(b) and shifts
the focus of that Rule and § 10(b) from fraud to disclosure.
See Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222, 234–235 (1980)
(“Section 10(b) is aptly described as a catchall provision, but
what it catches must be fraud”). It would also render § 11(a)'s
pure omission clause superfuous by making every omission
of a fact “required to be stated” a misleading half-truth.
   Moab also contends that without private liability for pure
omissions under Rule 10b–5(b), there will be “broad immu-
266          MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP. v.

nity any time an issuer fraudulently omits information Con-
gress and the SEC require it to disclose.” Brief for Re-
spondent Moab Partners, L. P. 1. That is not so. For one
thing, private parties remain free to bring claims based on
Item 303 violations that create misleading half-truths. For
another, the SEC retains authority to prosecute violations of
its own regulations. The Exchange Act requires that issu-
ers fle reports “in accordance with such rules and regula-
tions as the Commission may prescribe,” 15 U. S. C. § 78m(a),
and the SEC can investigate “whether any person has vio-
lated . . . any provision of [the Exchange Act], [or] the rules
or regulations thereunder,” § 78u(a)(1), including Item 303.2

                              *      *      *
   Pure omissions are not actionable under Rule 10b–5(b).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
Page Proof Pending Publication               It is so ordered.

     Moab and the United States spill much ink fghting the question pre-
sented, insisting that this case is about half-truths rather than pure omis-
sions. The Court granted certiorari to address the Second Circuit's pure
omission analysis, not its half-truth analysis. See Pet. for Cert. i
(“Whether . . . a failure to make a disclosure required under Item 303 can
support a private claim under Section 10(b), even in the absence of an
otherwise-misleading statement” (emphasis added)); see also 2022 WL
17815767, *1 (Dec. 20, 2022) (distinguishing between these “two circum-
stances”). The Court does not opine on issues that are either tangential
to the question presented or were not passed upon below, including what
constitutes “statements made,” when a statement is misleading as a half-
truth, or whether Rules 10b–5(a) and 10b–5(c) support liability for pure
omissions.
