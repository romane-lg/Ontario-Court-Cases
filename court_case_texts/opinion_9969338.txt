           HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

       No. 23–21. Argued March 25, 2024—Decided May 16, 2024
When the Department of Defense furloughed petitioner Stuart Harrow
 for six days, he challenged that decision before the Merit Systems Pro-
 tection Board. After a five-year delay, the Board ruled against him.
 Harrow had the right to appeal that decision to the Court of Appeals
 for the Federal Circuit, provided he did so “within 60 days” of the
 Board’s final order. 5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(1). But Harrow did not learn
 about the Board’s decision until the 60-day period to appeal had run,
 and filed his appeal late. Given the circumstances, Harrow asked the
 Federal Circuit to overlook his untimeliness and equitably toll the fil-
 ing deadline. But the Circuit, believing that the deadline was an un-
 alterable “jurisdictional requirement,” denied his request.
Held: Section 7703(b)(1)’s 60-day filing deadline is not jurisdictional.
 Although the procedural rules that govern the litigation process are
 often phrased in mandatory terms, they are generally subject to excep-
 tions like waiver, forfeiture, and equitable tolling. But when Congress
 enacts a “jurisdictional” requirement, it “mark[s] the bounds” of a
 court’s power, and a litigant’s failure to follow the rule “deprives a
 court of all authority to hear a case,” with no exceptions. Boechler v.
 Commissioner, 596 U. S. 199, 203. Mindful of those repercussions, the
 Court will “treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional only if
 Congress ‘clearly states’ that it is.” Ibid. Under that approach, “most
 time bars are nonjurisdictional,” even when “framed in mandatory”
 and “emphatic” terms. United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S. 402,
 410–411.
    No language in the provision Harrow violated suggests a different
 result. Section 7703(b)(1) states that an appeal “shall be filed within
 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order.” Although the
 deadline is stated in mandatory terms, this fact is “of no consequence”
2               HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                                   Syllabus

    to the jurisdictional issue. Id., at 411. “What matters instead” is
    whether the time bar speaks to the court’s jurisdiction. Ibid. And
    §7703(b)(1) does not.
       The Government rests its case on a different statute spelling out the
    Federal Circuit’s subject-matter jurisdiction, but that law provides it
    no better support. In 28 U. S. C. §1295(a)(9), Congress granted the
    Circuit jurisdiction “of an appeal from a final order or final decision of
    the Merit Systems Protection Board, pursuant to section[ ] 7703(b)(1).”
    The Government argues that an appeal is “pursuant to” §7703(b)(1)—
    and so within the Federal Circuit’s jurisdiction—only if it fully com-
    plies with §7703(b)(1)’s requirements, including the time bar. But that
    interpretation is more strained than clear. When a legal drafter writes
    that a filing has been made “pursuant to” a statutory provision, the
    phrase often functions as a synonym for “under,” identifying the pro-
    vision that served as the basis for the filing but without addressing
    whether the latter conformed to the former’s every requirement. The
    Court has recently used the phrase this way, as has Congress. See BP
    p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S. 230, 238. So
    to file an appeal “pursuant to” §7703(b)(1) likely just means to invoke
    that section as the basis for the appeal. At the very least, there is no
    clarity the other way. And the rest of §1295 confirms that conclusion.
    The law uses the phrase “pursuant to” to reference several other stat-
    utes, which in turn contain a bevy of procedural rules. The Govern-
    ment’s interpretation would suggest that all those rules are jurisdic-
    tional too. But the Court has almost never treated rules like these as
    absolute bars to judicial action.
       The Government cites one kind of time limit that counts as jurisdic-
    tional even without a clear statement—deadlines to appeal a district
    court decision in a civil case. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205. But
    this Bowles exception is for appeals from one Article III court to an-
    other. As to all other time bars, like the agency appeal here, the clear-
    statement rule applies. And for the reasons stated, the 60-day dead-
    line to appeal Board decisions does not satisfy it. Pp. 3–9.
Vacated and remanded.

STUART R. HARROW, PETITIONER v. DEPARTMENT
               OF DEFENSE
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
                                 [May 16, 2024]

   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
   A federal employee subjected to an adverse personnel ac-
tion may complain to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
If the Board rules against him, he may appeal to the Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit “within 60 days.” 5
U. S. C. §7703(b)(1). The question presented is whether
that 60-day limit is “jurisdictional,” and therefore precludes
equitable exceptions. We hold that the limit, like most fil-
ing deadlines, is not jurisdictional.
                               I
  This case began in 2013, when Stuart Harrow, a longtime
employee of the Department of Defense, filed a claim with
the Merit Systems Protection Board objecting to a six-day
furlough. The Board is an independent agency established
to adjudicate federal employment disputes. It referred the
case, as is usual, to an administrative judge for an initial
decision. In 2016, the judge upheld the furlough, finding it
“regrettable” but not “improper.” No. 22–2254 (CA Fed.),
ECF Doc. 6, p. 19. Harrow sought review of that conclusion
before the full Board, as the law allows. But in early 2017—
with Harrow’s action still pending—the Board lost its
2           HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                      Opinion of the Court

quorum, and so its ability to resolve cases. That state of
affairs lasted for over five years. It was not until May 2022
that the Board, with a quorum finally restored, affirmed the
administrative judge’s decision.
   That long delay led Harrow to miss his next deadline.
Under 5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(1), Harrow was supposed to peti-
tion for review in the Federal Circuit “within 60 days” of the
Board’s final order. See ibid. (stating that the petition
“shall be filed” within that time). But Harrow did not sub-
mit his petition until September 2022—more than 120 days
after the Board’s order issued. In an associated filing, Har-
row offered an excuse for his lateness. During his years-
long wait for the Board’s decision, Harrow explained, his
work email address had changed—and the old address at
some point stopped forwarding to the new one. See ECF
Doc. 8, at 7–8. So when the Board sent notice of its order to
the email address it had on file, Harrow never got the mes-
sage. He learned of the decision only from a search he did
of the Board’s website, after the 60-day period had run.
Given the “extenuating circumstances,” Harrow urged, the
Federal Circuit should overlook his petition’s untimeliness.
Id., at 7.
   The Court of Appeals declined Harrow’s request for equi-
table consideration, believing it had an absolute obligation
to dismiss his appeal. The court reasoned that the 60-day
statutory deadline is a “jurisdictional requirement,” and
therefore “not subject to equitable tolling.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 2a. “Harrow’s situation” might be “sympathetic,” the
court stated, but it was also irrelevant. Ibid. Given the
deadline’s jurisdictional nature, the court lacked the capac-
ity to “excuse a failure to timely file based on individual cir-
cumstances.” Ibid.
   We granted certiorari to decide whether, as the Federal
Circuit held, the 60-day deadline to appeal a Board decision
is jurisdictional. 601 U. S. ___ (2023). We hold it is not.

                      Opinion of the Court

                                II
   The procedural requirements that Congress enacts to
govern the litigation process are only occasionally as strict
as they seem. Most of those rules read as categorical com-
mands (e.g., a person “shall file in this court,” “shall file by
that time,” “shall include the following documents”). But
Congress legislates against the backdrop of judicial doc-
trines creating exceptions, and typically expects those doc-
trines to apply. See Minerva Surgical, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc.,
594 U. S. 559, 571–572 (2021). So a court will not enforce a
procedural rule against a non-complying party if his oppo-
nent has forfeited or waived an objection. And more rele-
vant here, a court may be able to excuse the party’s non-
compliance for equitable reasons. See infra, at 9. Except—
and this “except” is important—in a small set of cases,
where the procedural rule counts as “jurisdictional.” When
Congress enacts a jurisdictional requirement, it “mark[s]
the bounds” of a court’s power: A litigant’s failure to follow
the rule “deprives a court of all authority to hear a case.”
Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S. 199, 203 (2022); United
States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S. 402, 409 (2015). So a
court must enforce the rule even if no party has raised it.
And a court must adhere to the rule “even if equitable con-
siderations would support” excusing its violation. Id., at
409.
   Mindful of those repercussions, this Court will “treat a
procedural requirement as jurisdictional only if Congress
‘clearly states’ that it is.” Boechler, 596 U. S., at 203 (quot-
ing Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515 (2006)).
Congress of course need not use “magic words” to convey
that such a requirement confines a court’s authority. 596
U. S., at 203. But our demand for a clear statement erects
a “high bar.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 409. For a pro-
cedural rule to surmount it, “traditional tools of statutory
construction must plainly show that Congress imbued [the
rule] with jurisdictional consequences.” Id., at 410.
4           HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                      Opinion of the Court

   And under that approach, “most time bars are nonjuris-
dictional.” Ibid.; see Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical
Center, 568 U. S. 145, 154–155 (2013) (citing cases). That
is true whether or not the bar is “framed in mandatory
terms.” Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 410. Consider a pro-
vision closely resembling the one here: A veteran denied
benefits by an agency “shall file a notice of appeal with the
Court [of Appeals for Veterans Claims] within 120 days.”
38 U. S. C. §7266(a). We viewed the provision as a run-of-
the-mill “filing deadline,” seeking “to promote the orderly
progress of litigation” rather than to demarcate a court’s
power. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 435 (2011).
The time bar, we explained, “does not speak in jurisdic-
tional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the
Veterans Court.” Id., at 438 (alterations omitted). And we
made the same point when discussing a statute of limita-
tions whose phrasing was even more “emphatic.” Kwai Fun
Wong, 575 U. S., at 411. A “tort claim against the United
States shall be forever barred,” that provision pronounced,
unless presented “within two years.” 28 U. S. C. §2401(b).
Once again, we saw no sign that Congress meant to give the
time bar jurisdictional consequence. The provision, we rea-
soned, “does not define a federal court’s jurisdiction over
tort claims generally, address its authority to hear untimely
suits, or in any way cabin its usual equitable powers.” Kwai
Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411. The time limit was “just [a]
time limit[ ], nothing more.” Id., at 412.
   No language in the time-bar provision Harrow violated
suggests a different result. Section 7703(b)(1) states, as rel-
evant here:
    “[A] petition to review a final order or final decision of
    the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, any petition for review shall be
    filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the
                 Cite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024)            5

                     Opinion of the Court

    final order or decision of the Board.”
The provision thus describes how a litigant can obtain judi-
cial review of the Board’s final orders. It directs those ap-
peals—including Harrow’s—to the Federal Circuit. And it
sets a deadline: 60 days from when the Board’s order issues.
That deadline is stated in mandatory terms—“shall be
filed.” But as we have repeatedly held, that fact is “of no
consequence” to the jurisdictional issue. Kwai Fun Wong,
575 U. S., at 411; see Henderson, 562 U. S., at 439. “What
matters instead” is whether a time bar speaks to a court’s
authority to hear a case. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S., at 411.
And nothing in §7703(b)(1) does: There is no mention of the
Federal Circuit’s jurisdiction, whether generally or over un-
timely claims. So §7703(b)(1), on its own, does not deprive
the Federal Circuit of power to hear Harrow’s appeal. Not
even the Government, which defends the view that the 60-
day limit is jurisdictional, argues otherwise.
   The Government instead rests its case on part of a differ-
ent statute—28 U. S. C. §1295, which spells out the Federal
Circuit’s subject-matter jurisdiction. That law lists 14 cat-
egories of cases the court has power to decide. The one rel-
evant here is the ninth. Section 1295(a)(9) grants the Fed-
eral Circuit jurisdiction “of an appeal from a final order or
final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, pur-
suant to section[ ] 7703(b)(1).” In the Government’s view,
the term “pursuant to” means—indeed, can only mean—in
“conformance to” or “compliance with.” Brief for United
States 11; see id., at 38. So (the Government argues) only
appeals fully complying with §7703(b)(1)—including its 60-
day deadline—fall within the Federal Circuit’s jurisdiction.
In that way, the time limit becomes a “jurisdictional prereq-
uisite.” Id., at 11.
   But the Government’s reading of §1295(a)(9) is more
strained than clear. “Pursuant to” is one of those little
6          HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                      Opinion of the Court

phrases that can mean a raft of things. See B. Garner, Dic-
tionary of Legal Usage 737 (3d ed. 2011) (“Because the
phrase means so many things, it is rarely—if ever—use-
ful”). Maybe sometimes, as the Government urges, it con-
veys that one thing is in strict compliance with another.
But that is not the only—or even the most common—mean-
ing when a legal drafter writes that some filing has been
made “pursuant to” a statutory provision. Then the phrase
often functions as a legalese synonym for “under.” See ibid.
It identifies the provision that served as the basis for the
filing, but without addressing whether the latter conformed
to the former’s every requirement. Consider two of our own
opinions. In one, we stated that a law gave whistleblower
protection to employees of companies that “file [certain
statements] pursuant to §15(d),” even as we observed that
the employees might be “reporting violations” of that sec-
tion’s commands. Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. 429, 446
(2014). And similarly in another, we noted that a person
had “filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in [district
court] pursuant to” 28 U. S. C. §2254, only to hold three par-
agraphs later that he actually “could not satisfy” one of
§2254’s requirements. Alaska v. Wright, 593 U. S. 152,
153–154 (2021) (per curiam). In like manner, we today
could say that Harrow filed his appeal “pursuant to”
§7703(b)(1) even though he failed to satisfy that section’s
time bar.
   And more to the point, we think Congress would agree
with that usage. Consider a different law it drafted about
appellate review, which this Court recently examined. See
BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S.
230, 237–239 (2021). The provision is part of the statutory
scheme for removing cases from state to federal court. Un-
der that scheme, a defendant may remove a case by invok-
ing any of several statutory grounds; but the federal court
must remand the case to state court if it finds that the
ground does not apply. See 28 U. S. C. §§1441–1444,
                 Cite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024)            7

                     Opinion of the Court

1446(a), 1447(c). For the most part, a remand order is not
appealable. But that rule has an exception: An appeal is
allowed when the federal court remands a case that was
previously “removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443”
(which state two specific grounds for removal). §1447(d).
What does that “pursuant to” mean? It cannot mean that a
party may appeal only when his removal actually con-
formed to §1442 or §1443 (as the Government’s argument
here would imply). Whether the removal did so is the very
question the appeal will decide. Instead, as we explained
in BP p.l.c., to remove a case “pursuant to” §1442 or §1443
“just means” that the defendant must have “assert[ed] the
case is removable” under one of those provisions. 593 U. S.,
at 238. In similar vein, to file an appeal from a Board’s or-
der “pursuant to” §7703(b)(1) likely just means to invoke
that section as the basis for the appeal, rather than to com-
ply with its associated time limit. At the least, there is no
clarity the other way. Section 1295(a)(9)’s use of the words
“pursuant to” does not “plainly show” that §7703(b)(1)’s
deadline has “jurisdictional consequences.” Kwai Fun
Wong, 575 U. S., at 410.
   The rest of §1295 confirms that conclusion. In listing the
cases over which the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction, that
provision uses the term “pursuant to” several more times.
In particular, the Circuit can hear appeals from an agency
decision “pursuant to” a statute about public contracts, and
from a district court decision made “pursuant to” certain
patent statutes. §1295(a)(4)(C), (10). The referenced laws
in turn contain a bevy of procedural rules—not only setting
deadlines (as in §7703(b)(1)), but also requiring service and
other forms of notification, mandating prior government
authorization of certain matters, and even compelling the
payment of expenses. See 35 U. S. C. §§145, 146; 41
U. S. C. §7107(a)(1)(B). Assuming the phrase “pursuant to”
has the same meaning throughout §1295—and why should
8            HARROW v. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

                          Opinion of the Court

it not?—all those requirements, too, would become jurisdic-
tional. That result is untenable. We have almost never
treated the sort of routine rules swept up in the Govern-
ment’s “pursuant to” reading as absolute bars to judicial ac-
tion, neither subject to forfeiture nor excusable for equita-
ble reasons. See supra, at 3–4. So the wider implications
of the Government’s argument serve to defeat it (were any
doubt left). The jumble of procedural rules to which §1295
points cannot turn on and off the Federal Circuit’s power.
   The Government identifies one kind of time limit that
counts as jurisdictional, but we have already made plain its
exceptional nature. As the Government notes, the Court
held in Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), that the
deadline for filing an appeal from a district court’s decision
in a civil case is jurisdictional, even though the statute set-
ting that limit does not say as much. See Brief for United
States 24. In that decision, we reaffirmed a line of prece-
dents pre-dating our current approach to such matters. See
551 U. S., at 209–210, and n. 2. But we have since taken
care to delineate both where Bowles applies and where it
does not. Bowles governs statutory deadlines to appeal
“from one Article III court to another.” Hamer v. Neighbor-
hood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U. S. 17, 25 (2017). As
to all other time bars, we now demand a “clear statement.”
Id., at 25, n. 9. This case falls outside the Bowles exception
because Harrow appealed to the Federal Circuit not from
another court but from an agency. And as we have shown,
the time limit Harrow missed when he filed that appeal
does not satisfy our clear-statement test. See supra, at 4–
8.*
——————
   * The Government also invokes Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Manage-
ment, 470 U. S. 768 (1985), in support of its position, but that decision
helps it no more than Bowles. In Lindahl, the Court held that the Fed-
eral Circuit has jurisdiction over Board decisions denying disability re-
tirement claims. See 470 U. S., at 799. In doing so, we referred to not
only §1295 but also §7703(b)(1) as “jurisdictional.” Id., at 792–793. But
                     Cite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024)                    9

                          Opinion of the Court

   Having thus held that §7703(b)(1)’s deadline is non-juris-
dictional, we encounter a newly raised back-up argument.
Even if non-jurisdictional, the Government urges, the 60-
day limit “would still not be subject to equitable tolling.”
Brief for United States 42. In making that claim, the Gov-
ernment must contend with another high bar. “Because we
do not understand Congress to alter” age-old procedural
doctrines lightly, “nonjurisdictional [timing rules] are pre-
sumptively subject to equitable tolling.” Boechler, 596
U. S., at 209; see supra, at 3. The Government says it can
rebut that presumption, but we are not the right court to
now determine whether that is so. The Government did not
broach the issue below; the Federal Circuit did not address
it; and it is not included in the question presented. We
therefore leave the matter (including any waiver issues in-
volved) to the Federal Circuit on remand. And if that court
finds equitable tolling available, it should decide whether,
on the facts here, Harrow is entitled to that relief.
   For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-
ings consistent with this opinion.
                                             It is so ordered.




——————
that is just one more example (our recent decisions have offered many)
of how this Court used to apply the term “jurisdiction” in a “profligate”
manner, failing to distinguish between statutes spelling out a court’s
power and those specifying what steps litigants should take. Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 510 (2006); see Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.
443, 454–455 (2004). And in any event, Lindahl concerned only the scope
of claims that may be brought to the Federal Circuit; it had nothing to
do with time limits—which, we repeat, are generally non-jurisdictional.
See United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S. 402, 410 (2015); supra,
at 4.
