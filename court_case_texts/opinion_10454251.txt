SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
   LISA PRICE, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
   ESTATE OF NICKIE MILLER v. MONTGOMERY
           COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ET AL.
   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
               No. 23–649.   Decided July 2, 2024

   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR respecting the denial
of certiorari.
   Nickie Miller was charged with murder based on the false
confession of a witness. The witness later recanted her co-
erced confession, including in jailhouse letters she sent to
her husband. Upon learning about the letters, a court or-
dered the witness to retrieve and turn them over to Miller’s
defense team. The lead prosecutor on Miller’s case, Keith
Craycraft, instead allegedly encouraged the witness to de-
stroy the letters in response to the court order. The witness
destroyed the letters instead of turning them over.
   Miller spent two years in prison before the State dropped
the charges against him. Miller then sued Craycraft and
others under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, for mali-
cious prosecution, fabrication and destruction of evidence,
due process violations, and conspiracy. The District Court
dismissed the claims against Craycraft, concluding that he
had absolute immunity as a prosecutor. The Sixth Circuit
agreed, but noted that Craycraft’s “successful pressuring of
[the witness] to destroy her jailhouse correspondence” was
“difficult to justify and seemingly unbecoming of an official
entrusted with enforcing the criminal law.” 72 F. 4th 711,
720 (2023). Miller now asks this Court to decide whether
absolute immunity is available under §1983 when, as here,
a prosecutor knowingly destroys exculpatory evidence and

defies a court order. Pet. for Cert. i.
   The Court’s denial of certiorari should not signal toler-
ance of the prosecutor’s conduct.1 The allegations, assumed
true at this stage of the case, tell a disturbing story. Pros-
ecutors are “representative not of an ordinary party to a
controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern
impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at
all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution
is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.”
Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935). The prose-
cutor’s conduct in this case “diminishes the dignity of our
criminal justice system and undermines respect for the rule
of law.” Calhoun v. United States, 568 U. S. 1206, 1208
(2013) (SOTOMAYOR, J., statement respecting denial of cer-
tiorari).
   Prosecutorial immunity can promote “the vigorous and
fearless performance of the prosecutor’s duty.” Imbler v.
Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 427 (1976). This immunity has
limits, however. For example, absolute immunity does not
apply “when a prosecutor gives advice to police during a
criminal investigation, when the prosecutor makes state-
ments to the press, or when a prosecutor acts as a complain-
ing witness in support of a warrant application.” Van de
Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U. S. 335, 343 (2009) (citations
omitted).2 It is difficult to see how the conduct alleged here,

   1 The Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, including that the

facts presented by a petition do not clearly or cleanly implicate a division
of authority among the lower courts. See this Court’s Rule 10.
   2 Absolute prosecutorial immunity in theory is limited to “the immun-

ity historically accorded . . . at common law and the interests behind it.”
Imbler, 424 U. S., at 421; but see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 132
(1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“There was, of course, no such thing as
absolute prosecutorial immunity when §1983 was enacted”). Further, as
Judge Nalbandian discussed in his opinion below, recent scholarship de-
tails that the 1871 Civil Rights Act included language abrogating com-
mon-law immunities that was, for unknown reasons, omitted from the

including destruction of evidence to thwart a court order,
“require[s] legal knowledge and the exercise of related dis-
cretion,” id., at 344, or is “intimately associated with the
judicial phase of the criminal process,” Imbler, 424 U. S., at
430.
   Even when absolute prosecutorial immunity applies, it
“does not leave the public powerless to deter misconduct or
to punish that which occurs.” Id., at 429. Prosecutors ac-
cused of misconduct may still face criminal liability or “pro-
fessional discipline.” Ibid.; see also Connick v. Thompson,
563 U. S. 51, 66 (2011) (“An attorney who violates his or her
ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline, in-
cluding sanctions, suspension, and disbarment”). Yet,
these safeguards are effective only if employed.3
   Craycraft’s alleged misconduct of advising a witness to
destroy evidence to thwart a court order is stunning. If this
is what absolute prosecutorial immunity protects, the Court
may need to step in to ensure that the doctrine does not
exceed its “ ‘quite sparing’ ” bounds. Buckley v. Fitzsim-
mons, 509 U. S. 259, 269 (1993). Otherwise, we risk leaving
“victims of egregious prosecutorial misconduct without a
remedy.” Michaels v. McGrath, 531 U. S. 1118, 1119 (2001)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).

first compilation of federal law. 72 F. 4th 711, 727, n. 1 (CA6 2023) (opin-
ion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“So, according to this
recent scholarship, because the Civil Rights Act of 1871 explicitly abro-
gated the common-law immunities grounded in state law, those immun-
ities are abrogated now sub silentio under the current version of §1983”

munity’s Flawed Foundation, 111 Cal. L. Rev. 201, 235 (2023)). This new
scholarship reinforces why, at a minimum, this immunity doctrine
should be employed sparingly.

tional rights . . . are almost never brought,” “[n]or are prosecutors typi-
cally punished by their supervisors or removed from office”).
