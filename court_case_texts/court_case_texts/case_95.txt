SENTENCING DECISION
ASSIÉ J.:
[

]
The defendant was convicted after trial of the
following offences:
(1)
Assaulting his wife on September 4, 2022,
(2)
Failing to comply with an undertaking by
communicating with his wife on October 17, 2022, and
(3)
Distributing intimate images of his wife without
consent on October 22, 2022.
[

]
This is my decision on his sentence.
Charges of Assault
[
3
]
On September 4, 2022, the victim and the
defendant were in their bedroom when an argument arose regarding their marriage.
The victim suggested the defendant go to sleep and defer the discussion until
the morning. The defendant then got on top of her, grabbed her by the throat, and
applied pressure. She was able to push him off and escaped to the washroom,
where she called 911. She later described the pressure as a “7” on a scale of 1
to 10, with 1 being light and 10 being severe. She was not asked whether she
experienced difficulty breathing. She sustained a scratch on the left side of
her mouth during the assault, which she attributed to contact with the
defendant’s fingernail. When police arrived, she indicated she did not want her
husband arrested but wanted the assault to stop. The defendant was nonetheless
arrested and subsequently released on an undertaking.
Charges of Breaching an Undertaking
[
4
]
One of the conditions of the undertaking imposed
upon the defendant’s release on the domestic assault charge was that he not
communicate, directly or indirectly, with the victim.
[
5
]
On October 17, 2022, the victim received a
message from an Instagram account with the username “selffishloving”. I found
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was responsible for this account.
Through it, the defendant posted photographs of the victim, her mother, her
brother, and her sister-in-law. He also connected the account to other
Instagram accounts associated with individuals from the victim’s village in
India and with businesses she frequented in Canada. In addition, the defendant
sent a message stating that he wanted to “finish” the victim and that he would
show people from her village intimate photos and videos of her. He was arrested
for breaching the undertaking by communicating with her and released on bail.
Charges of Distributing Intimate
Images without Consent
[
6
]
In October 2022, the defendant began contacting
the victim’s brother, asking him to return his calls. On October 22, the
victim’s brother spoke with the defendant by telephone. During the
conversation, the defendant stated that he intended to send him videos of the
victim, upload them to pornography websites, and distribute them to chat groups
involving people from her village in India. The victim’s brother urged the
defendant not to proceed with his threat and to attempt instead to resolve his
differences with the victim.
[
7
]
Shortly after this call, the victim’s brother
began receiving multiple text messages from the defendant, who was using a
number intended to obscure his identity. The messages included hostile remarks
directed at the victim and her family and were accompanied by an intimate video
of the victim. In these messages, the defendant repeated that he had additional
videos of the victim, that he intended to upload them to pornography websites,
and circulate them among members of her village. He also urged the victim’s
brother to view the video and commit suicide. The victim’s brother did not
watch the video. He informed his wife (the victim’s sister-in-law) about the
call and the messages. The sister-in-law then viewed the video on his phone in
another room. She confirmed the video depicted the victim and the defendant
engaging in sexual activity. The victim’s face was visible, but the defendant’s
was not.
[
8
]
The sister-in-law forwarded the video to her own
device and deleted it from her husband’s phone to prevent him from
inadvertently viewing it. She then informed the victim of what had occurred and
sent her the video. At the victim’s request, she also took screenshots of the
text messages the victim’s brother received and forwarded them to her.
[
9
]
The victim testified that she viewed the video
after her sister-in-law sent it to her. She confirmed that it was a recording
created by the defendant and that he was the only person who possessed it. She
expressed shock and distress at the fact that the video had been shared with
her family. She testified that she had never consented to its distribution.
The Purposes
and Principles of Sentencing
[
10
]
The
defendant has been convicted of three offences: domestic assault, failing to
comply with a domestic release order, and distributing intimate images without
consent. All three offences are hybrid offences. When prosecuted summarily, as
in the case here, the maximum sentences are two years less a day.
[1]
There are no mandatory minimums.
[
11
]
Sentencing is an individualized process that takes into account
the seriousness of the offence, the degree of responsibility of the offender,
and the harm caused. The fundamental purposes of sentencing are set out in
section 718
of the
Criminal Code
,
namely, to contribute, along with
crime prevention initiatives, to the respect for the law and the maintenance of
a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or
more of the following objectives:
(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;
(b) to deter the offender and other
persons from committing offences;
(c) to separate offenders from
society, where necessary;
(d) to assist in rehabilitating
offenders;
(e) to provide reparations for harm
done to victims or to the community; and
(f) to promote a sense of
responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims
and to the community.
[
12
]
A
central principle in sentencing is proportionality: the sentence must match the
seriousness of the crime and the offender’s degree of responsibility.
[2]
While it must be
strong enough to denounce the conduct, it cannot go beyond what is fair given
the offender’s blameworthiness.
[3]
A fair sentence balances both aspects of proportionality, without emphasizing
one over the other.
[4]
The relative significance of each sentencing objective is contingent upon the
nature of the offence and the offender’s personal circumstances.
[5]
There exists no definitive
algorithm or formula by which the justness of a sentence can be objectively
determined. Parity gives meaning to proportionality. Parity means that
offenders who commit similar crimes, under similar circumstances, should
receive similar sentences. It is rooted in fairness and equality before the
law, ensuring that sentencing does not become arbitrary or wildly inconsistent.
[6]
[
13
]
A
helpful starting point for a sentencing judge is to consider the range of
sentences established by statute and caselaw. Ranges reflect accumulated
judicial experience. Given the varied ways in which offences may be committed
and the differing circumstances of offenders, judges may depart from
established ranges where appropriate.
[7]
[
14
]
The
applicable range is informed by the aggravating and mitigating factors present
in the case, which includes the personal circumstances of the offender. An
aggravating factor is one that is not inherent in the offence itself. As the
Court of Appeal observed in
R. v. V.(M.)
, “It is helpful to think of the
material aggravating factors as those that increase the gravity of the offence
relative to other offences of the same kind, or that increase the degree of
responsibility of the offender, relative to other offenders committing the same
kind of offence.”
[8]
[
15
]
Parliament
has also legislated factors that a court must consider as aggravating. In this
case, the relevant statutory factors are that the defendant abused his intimate
partner
[9]
and that the abuse had a significant impact on the victim.
[10]
[
16
]
The
range of sentences for assault extends from absolute discharges to terms of
custody. The fact that the defendant was subject to an undertaking at the time
is inherent to the offence of failing to comply with a release order and does
not constitute an additional aggravating factor. However, the manner in which an
undertaking is breached may be aggravating–including whether the victim of the
breach was a domestic partner.  In this case, the defendant breached the order
by directly communicating with the victim to threaten her. Compliance with
non-communication orders imposed as a result of allegations of domestic assault
is critical to ensure that complainants in domestic assault cases can rely on
the protection of the criminal justice system. Breaches of such orders in this
context require both specific and general deterrence to be given significant
weight. There can be no greater sense of frustration and powerlessness when a
complainant in a domestic assault case finally musters the courage to call the
police, only to have the alleged perpetrator communicate with them with impunity.
In appropriate cases, custodial sentences will be warranted for such breaches.
[
17
]
Parliament
created the offence of distributing intimate images without consent in 2014,
and it came into force in 2015. A review of sentencing caselaw demonstrates that
a wide range of sentences have been imposed–from conditional discharges to
custodial terms. The Ontario Court of Appeal has not yet provided guidance on
the appropriate range of sentences. However, in
R. v. S.C.C
.
, the
Manitoba Court of Appeal observed:
Distribution of an intimate
image without consent is a sexual offence as well as a privacy offence
punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of five years upon indictable
proceedings. Deterrence and denunciation are the primary sentencing objectives.
Therefore, the focus on sentencing for this offence is more on the offence
committed than on the circumstances of the accused (references omitted).
[11]
[
18
]
The
offence of distributing intimate images applies irrespective of the
relationship between the victim and the individual who distributes the
material. It is not inherent in the offence that the victim is a domestic
partner. Accordingly, where the victim is a domestic partner, that circumstance
constitutes an aggravating factor. As Justice Gibson observed in
R. v.
Cole
:
There is no doubt that the distribution of
intimate images without consent is a form of intimate partner violence, and
that it is a sexual and privacy offence that disproportionately impacts women:
R.
v. Ha
,
2023 ONCJ 75
. The phenomenon of intimate image publication without
consent needs to be addressed in a serious and targeted manner:
R. v. J.B.
,
2018 ONSC 4726
.
[12]
[
19
]
The offender’s motive in distributing the images
is a relevant consideration in assessing the gravity of the conduct. Motives
may fall along a spectrum of seriousness. At the less aggravated end are
circumstances where an individual shares a partner’s intimate image with
acquaintances in a misguided attempt at bragging. More serious are cases where
images are disseminated online to strangers for purposes of sexual
gratification. While such conduct is selfish and disregards the victim’s
dignity, it is not necessarily directed at causing harm. At the most aggravated
end are situations where the distribution is motivated by a deliberate
intention to humiliate, degrade, or extort the victim.
[
20
]
By analogy, the factors applied in assessing the
seriousness of child pornography offences may also assist in evaluating the
seriousness of distributing intimate images. Certain features of the material
increase its gravity.
[13]
Videos are generally regarded as more aggravating than still photographs as
they convey a greater sense of realism. The degree of intrusiveness in the acts
depicted is also relevant, with a qualitative distinction between a simple nude
image and a recording of sexual activity. The impact is further heightened
where the victim is identifiable, whether by the exposure of their face, other
distinguishing features such as tattoos, or by the disclosure of their name or
contact information. Finally, the volume of images or videos distributed bears
on the seriousness of the conduct, with greater quantities tending to increase
its aggravating character. However, it must never be overlooked that even one
image or video can have a profound impact on a victim.
[
21
]
The
relationship between the offender and the victim is also a relevant
consideration. Breaches committed by an intimate partner are particularly
aggravating as they undermine the trust inherent in such a relationship. The
identity of the recipients of the material is also significant. Distribution to
family members, friends, or colleagues is more aggravating than distribution to
strangers. The permanence of the material is likewise relevant: the harm is
heightened where the victim must live with the knowledge that the material may
continue to exist online indefinitely. It is further aggravating if the
offender received financial compensation for the material or if the victim was
required to expend resources or time to have it removed.
[
22
]
In
summary, the following list of non-exhaustive factors are relevant in assessing
the seriousness of the offence of distributing intimate images without consent:
(1)
The relationship between the victim and the offender.
(2)
Whether the images were obtained with consent or without the victim’s
knowledge. While images created with consent is a neutral factor, images
created without consent is an aggravating factor.
(3)
Whether the distribution was impulsive or premeditated.
(4)
The offender’s motive for distributing the material.
(5)
Whether the material consisted of photographs or videos.
(6)
The degree of intrusiveness of the acts depicted.
(7)
The number of images or videos distributed.
(8)
Whether the victim’s identity was revealed.
(9)
The extent of the distribution.
(10)
Whether
the material was shared with family members, friends, colleagues, or strangers.
(11)
Whether
the material could be deleted or was likely to remain online permanently.
(12)
The
financial and temporal costs incurred by the victim to have the material
removed.
(13)
Whether
the offender derived a financial benefit.
(14)
The
overall impact on the victim.
Caselaw Review
[
23
]
Prior
to September 18, 2019, the maximum sentence for distributing an intimate image
without consent when prosecuted summarily was six months of custody. Since that
date, the maximum penalty has been increased to two years less a day.
Accordingly, the caselaw considered here focuses on decisions rendered after
the increase in maximum penalties.
[

]
In
R. v. C.S
., the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing
an intimate image without consent.
[14]
He sent the victim’s new
partner a video of himself and the victim engaging in sexual activity. The
video was accompanied by crude text messages to the new partner and taunting
messages to the victim. The trial judge imposed a conditional discharge with a
three-year probation order that included a period of house arrest resembling a
conditional sentence order. The Crown appealed. A summary conviction appeal
court deferred to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion and upheld the
sentence.
[

]
In
R. v. Cole
, the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing an intimate
image without consent and to breaching a release order.
[15]
After learning that
his wife had been unfaithful, he distributed 24 intimate images of her. While
on bail, he was residing at a hotel where the complainant joined him. A
physical altercation occurred, and the police were called. He was subsequently
charged with breaching his release order by having contact with the
complainant. The defendant was a first-time offender. The trial judge imposed a
conditional discharge with a probation order that included a period of house
arrest. The Crown appealed. A summary conviction appeal court deferred to the
trial judge’s decision and upheld the sentence.

]
In
R. v.
Hunter
,
the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing an intimate image without consent
and to harassment.
[17]
Following the end of their relationship, he continued to
attempt contact with the victim by telephone and text message. Acting out of
anger, he distributed intimate images of her to two individuals through
Facebook. The defendant was 28 years old and a first-time offender. The trial
judge imposed a conditional discharge with a probation order that included a
period of house arrest.
[

]
In
R. v.
S.F.
,
the defendant was found guilty after trial of distributing an intimate image
without consent.
[18]
He had uploaded two videos of himself and the victim engaging in sexual
activity to a pornography website. Although the victim had consented to making
the recordings, she had not consented to their distribution. A male
acquaintance recognized her in one of the videos, leading to her discovery of
their existence. Both the victim and the defendant contacted the website, and
the videos were removed. However, they had been downloaded by an unknown
individual and reposted. The defendant was a 26-year-old university student and
first-time offender. The court suspended the passing of sentence and placed him
on 14 months of probation.

In
R. v.
Boucetta
,
the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing an intimate image without consent and
to voyeurism.
[19]
The defendant and the victim were university students who had sexual
intercourse while the victim was severely intoxicated. The defendant recorded
the activity without her knowledge and later distributed the recording to his
friends. The defendant was 21 years old and a first-time offender. The Crown
sought a custodial term of 12 to 18 months, while the defence sought a
conditional sentence order. The court imposed a 24-month conditional sentence
order.
[

]
In
R. v. Li
, the defendant pleaded guilty to distributing an intimate image
without consent.
[20]
During sexual intercourse with the victim, he recorded her
against her wishes while she attempted to cover her face. The following day, he
sent her two photographs from the recording and stated that he would post the
material to a pornography website. He subsequently distributed the video to one
of her friends, her parents in China, and her father’s co-worker. He also
uploaded it to a website, falsely representing that the victim was offering
sexual services. As a result, the victim received unsolicited messages from
strangers. The defendant was 29 years old, a first-time offender, with a
history of mental illness. At the time of sentencing, he was married with a
child and the sole provider for his family. The court imposed a 22-month
conditional sentence order, followed by probation.

]
In
R. v. Storing
, the defendant pleaded guilty to
distributing an intimate image without consent and to
possessing a firearm without a licence.
[21]
Following the breakdown of his relationship with the complainant, he sent
images of her breasts and genitalia to her daughter through Facebook. The
defendant was 46 years old, a first-time offender, and suffered from PTSD and
depression arising from a severely deprived and abusive childhood. The court
imposed a 10-month conditional sentence order followed by probation for the
distribution charge.
[

Defence
counsel relied on
R. v. Simpson
.
[22]
In that case, the defendant changed his plea from not guilty to guilty partway
through trial on charges of distributing an intimate image without consent and
assault. The Crown sought a six-month conditional sentence order, following 95
days of pre-sentence custody (enhanced). The defence sought a three-month
conditional sentence order. The court imposed a seven-month conditional
sentence order in addition to the pre-sentence custody he served. The judgment
provided limited details of the circumstances concerning the distribution
offence, indicating only that the defendant sent a single intimate image of the
victim to her child’s father following a heated text exchange. It is noteworthy
that the offence occurred before the statutory increase in the maximum penalty
for distribution of intimate images.

In
R. v. Labreche
, the defendant was found guilty of
distributing an intimate image without consent.

He posted images of his
former partner on the internet accompanied by derogatory comments. The
defendant was a 26-year-old Métis first-time offender and had experienced a
difficult upbringing. The court imposed a 90-day intermittent custodial
sentence together with a term of probation.

The
defence relied on
R. v. Newby
.

The defendant pleaded guilty to uploading intimate images without consent of
his former partner nude and engaged in sexual activity to three websites. He
also sent links to two of the victim’s friends. The Crown sought a six-month
custodial term, while the defence sought a conditional sentence order. The
defendant had no prior criminal record, was employed, had engaged in
counselling prior to his plea, and had completed over 67 hours of community
service. The court imposed a 90-day intermittent custodial sentence together
with two years of probation. Note the maximum penalty at the time of the
offence was six months of custody.

The defendant and the victim had engaged in a casual sexual relationship. The
defendant recorded the victim performing sexual acts without his knowledge and
posted the video online to a monetized website. The victim’s face was visible,
and the material remained on a high-traffic website for two months. The
defendant was a 44-year-old first-time offender. The court imposed four months

He had threatened to release intimate videos, and when challenged to prove
their existence, he texted a screenshot of one such video. He acknowledged this
conduct while testifying at trial. The Crown proceeded by indictment, carrying
a maximum penalty of five years. The defendant was a 36-year-old first-time
offender on a work permit, for whom any conviction would result in deportation.
Defence counsel sought a conditional discharge. The defendant had engaged in
counselling, written a letter of apology, accepted responsibility, and
demonstrated insight into the harm caused. The court imposed a five-month

showing her face in one video. He also uploaded explicit photographs of them
engaged in sexual activity in which her distinctive tattoo was visible. The
victim learned of the postings when an acquaintance discovered them. The videos
had been viewed over 2,000 times before removal, although it was unknown
whether copies had been downloaded. The defendant was 38 years old, had a
criminal record for domestic violence against this and two prior partners, and
convictions for possession of child pornography and voyeurism involving a
16-year-old girl. The trial judge imposed a 14-month custodial sentence for the
distribution offence and 90 days concurrent for the breach. On appeal, the
Court of Appeal held that a penitentiary term would have been appropriate but
declined to exceed the Crown’s position at trial. A sentence of two years less
a day was substituted.

The
case law demonstrates significant variation in sentencing outcomes. It is not
uncommon for the vengeful distribution of identifiable intimate images to
result in sentences in the mid to upper reformatory range. Justice Wadden
observed in
Weedon
:
Principles of
denunciation and deterrence are paramount. A clear message must be sent that
society will not tolerate abuse of an intimate partner in this manner. It is a
serious form of psychological violence causing almost incalculable long-term
harm to the victim. In the modern world, almost any man in a dating
relationship is capable to doing this act. As some of the cases make clear,
there are entire websites devoted to such "revenge porn". Principles
of general deterrence require a significant sentence that would deter others in
a similar situation who would be tempted to commit this crime.
[34]
Sentencing for Multiple Offences
[
44
]
As
a general principle, where an offender is convicted of multiple offences that
do not arise from the same transaction or series of events, and where there is
no close nexus between them, consecutive sentences will ordinarily be imposed.
[35]
This approach is particularly appropriate where the offences affect different
legal interests.
[36]
In imposing consecutive terms, the court must remain attentive to the totality
principle to ensure that the overall sentence is not unduly harsh or
disproportionate to the offender’s overall culpability.
[37]
Circumstances of the Offender
[
45
]
The
defendant is currently 42 years old and was 39 at the time of the offences. He arrived
in Canada in 2005 from India. He has been a permanent resident for the last 20
years. He is gainfully employed as a truck driver and has family support as
evidenced by his parents attending court throughout the process.
[
46
]
The
defendant provided a letter dated August 30, 2025, which indicated he completed
­­­­12 sessions of counselling with the Partner Assault Response Program. It is
unclear when counselling began. The author of the letter wrote:
[The defendant] participated
well in his counselling sessions. He showed interest in the program and in
gaining good knowledge and skills for managing his emotions, and maintaining
and improving good relationships and being aware and mindful about sexual
boundaries and other related issues. He learned the importance of strong
boundaries, honesty, respect, integrity and trustworthiness.
[38]
[
47
]
The
defendant also provided a letter dated August 25, 2025, from an immigration
lawyer outlining the potential immigration consequences of potential sentences.
As a permanent resident, the defendant would be inadmissible to Canada on
grounds of serious criminality if sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding
six months.
[39]
In other words, he would likely be deported. The defence highlighted the
principles articulated in
R. v. Pham
that a sentencing judge may
exercise discretion to consider collateral immigration consequences, provided
that the sentence imposed remains proportionate to the gravity of the offence
and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
[40]
[
48
]
There
is no evidence before the court of any remorse or insight on the part of the
defendant. In addition, there is no evidence that the intimate images of the
victim in the defendant’s possession have been deleted.
Impact on the Victim
[
49
]
The
victim provided a Victim Impact Statement. I believe it is important to read
the impact this offence has had on the victim in her own words:
I am writing this statement to express the deep and lasting
emotional, psychological, and social impact that the offender’s actions have
had on me and my family. Since this situation began, I have experienced intense
anxiety, stress, and fear that have become part of my daily life. I often feel
overwhelmed and mentally exhausted. It has become difficult for me to
concentrate, sleep, or go about normal daily routines... My sense of peace and
stability has been shattered. Emotionally, I feel violated, humiliated, and
betrayed. I carry a constant weight of shame, worry, and vulnerability. These
feelings are not only about what happened, but about the fear of what could
still happen. I often feel powerless and afraid to engage with the world, both
online and in person. Simple things like answering the phone,
checking messages, or going out in public now cause me fear and distress. The
situation has affected my entire family… Our family now lives in a state of
hyper vigilance. We avoid public gatherings, limit our interactions online, and
constantly worry about being exposed, judged, or harmed. We feel like we have
lost our basic sense of privacy and security. This fear has created a sense of
isolation and powerlessness. It's heartbreaking to feel that we cannot even
visit our home, our roots, or extended family without feeling threatened. The
ongoing fear of being harassed, humiliated, or harmed again is paralyzing. The
emotional damage has been severe, but even more than that, we no longer feel
safe–either in our homes or in our community. We are scared that the damage
could escalate at anytime, and this fear continues to control our lives.
[
50
]
To
say that the offender’s actions have had a serious impact on the victim and her
family is an understatement.
Position of the Parties
[
51
]
The
Crown submitted that a global custodial sentence in the range of six to eight
months, together with a probation order of three years, would be appropriate.
The Crown did not specify how the custodial term should be apportioned among
the offences.
[
52
]
The
defence submitted that a 90-day intermittent custodial sentence, in addition to
the eight days of pre-sentence custody already served, would be appropriate.
Defence counsel did not make submissions regarding the length of probation.
Counsel also noted that the defendant has been on bail for nearly 30 months
without further allegations of contacting the victim.
[
53
]
After
considering submissions from counsel and conducting my own research, I advised
counsel that I was considering a sentence higher than the Crown’s position. I
invited, and received, further submissions from both parties in accordance with
the procedure endorsed in
R. v. Nahanee
.
[41]
[
54
]
The Crown maintained that the range of six to eight months was
appropriate and consistent with the principle of parity. The defence modified
its position to suggest a range of three to six months.
Conclusion
[
55
]
The
defendant was convicted after trial of assaulting his wife, breaching an
undertaking, and distributing an intimate video of his wife without her
consent. There are limited mitigating features in this case. Although he is not
a youthful offender, he is a first-time offender and completed some counselling
before sentencing.
[42]
[
56
]
The
context of the defendant’s offences places his conduct at the higher end of the
spectrum of seriousness. The victim was his wife, making the conduct a form of
domestic abuse and a statutorily aggravating factor. The breach of trust had a
profound impact on her, leaving her in constant fear. The video depicted highly
intrusive acts in which her identity was visible. It was sent to her brother in
circumstances intended to cause harm. His actions were intended to degrade and
humiliate the victim. Prior to sending the video, he texted that he would
“finish” her and told her brother to watch the video and to kill himself.
[
57
]
This
conduct was not impulsive. Weeks before sending the video, he created a fake
Instagram account using images of the victim and her family, linking it to
individuals and businesses in the victim’s community in Canada and in India. He
threatened to release the videos and subsequently carried out that threat by
sending the first video to her brother.
[
58
]
The
traditional mitigating features of an early guilty plea, expressions of
insight, and remorse are absent. No evidence was presented that the intimate
images have been deleted. It should be noted that the defendant is entitled to
maintain his innocence and deny responsibility for distributing the images.
However, maintaining his innocence is not inconsistent with providing
assurances that any intimate images in his possession during the relationship
have been destroyed. The absence of such assurances does not constitute an
aggravating factor but reflects the lack of insight into the concerns of the
victim and could have offered some limited measure of reassurance to the victim
and the court.
[
59
]
Having
considered all the factors, I find that a fit sentence for the offence of
distributing intimate images without consent is 12 months of custody, followed
by three years of probation.
[
60
]
Though
counsel did not ask for a conditional sentence, given the mixed jurisprudence
and the availability of a conditional sentence, I have considered whether a
conditional sentence order could meet the objectives of sentencing for the
offence of distributing intimate images without consent. Given the premeditated
nature of the conduct, the targeted dissemination to a close family member, the
complainant’s identifiability and the explicit nature of the recording, and the
profound, ongoing impact described in the Victim Impact Statement, I am
satisfied that only real custody can adequately meet denunciation and general
deterrence in these circumstances. A conditional sentence order would not be a
proportionate or sufficient response.
[
61
]
With
respect to the breach of an undertaking, the manner of the breach is highly
aggravating. The defendant communicated directly with the victim, a domestic
partner, which is a statutory aggravating factor. Furthermore, the
communication involved threats to “finish” her and threats to distribute her
intimate images without her consent. I find that a fit sentence for this
offence is two months of custody.
[
62
]
With
respect to the assault, the defendant was not on a release order at the time. The
act was impulsive, there was no evidence that the victim’s breathing was
affected, and no non-trivial physical injuries were sustained. I find that a
fit sentence is a suspended sentence with 12 months of probation.
[
63
]
The
breach of the undertaking did not arise during the same transaction as the
distribution of intimate images. Given that there is no close nexus between the
two offences, the sentences shall run consecutively. I’ve considered the
principle of totality. I find that a global sentence of 14 months in custody
followed by three years of probation is proportionate and not unduly harsh considering
the offender’s overall culpability.
[
64
]
I
am mindful of the reality that this sentence will likely lead to the
defendant’s deportation. I appreciate the serious collateral consequence that
this sentence will have on the defendant. However, I am unable to conclude that
a sentence of six months or less would be appropriate given the particular
facts of this case and the vengeful, callous, and premeditated manner in which
the defendant committed his offences and the lasting harm he caused the victim
and her family.
