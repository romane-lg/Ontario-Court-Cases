Introduction:
[
1
]
Mr. Mason Heslip has been found guilty of:
•
Impaired Operation of a Conveyance (s.
320.14(1)(a)); and
•
Operation with Blood Alcohol Concentration Over
80 mg% (s. 320.14(1)(b)).
[
2
]
The Crown seeks a custodial sentence of 45 to 60
days, an 18-month driving prohibition, and two years probation, citing the seriousness
of the offence and the need for general deterrence and public denunciation. The
Defence proposes an elevated fine, an 18-month driving prohibition, and, if
necessary, a probation period. The focus is on Mr. Heslip’s rehabilitation, his
lack of prior record, the lack of personal injury, and the suitability of a
non-custodial sentence.
[
3
]
The Crown initially sought a free-standing
restitution order; however, the City of Brampton has been sufficiently
compensated by Intact Insurance for the damaged city property that was repaired
and replaced.
[
4
]
After reviewing the evidence, the pre-sentence
report, submissions, and relevant jurisprudence, I conclude that a two-month
conditional sentence order and an 18-month driving prohibition are appropriate
and just in the circumstances.
Factual Context:
[
5
]
On December 8, 2022, Mr. Heslip was
significantly impaired while driving. His blood alcohol levels were 310 mg% and
290 mg%, exceeding four times the legal limit. He ran a red light, became
airborne, and crashed through two residential fences, coming to a stop in a
backyard. The damage was substantial, but no injuries were reported.
[
6
]
Mr. Heslip cooperated with the police and made
several inculpatory statements, which were deemed admissible.
Mr. Heslip’s Background and Circumstances:
[
7
]
Mr. Mason Heslip is a 35-year-old Canadian citizen with
no prior criminal record. He was born in Orangeville, Ontario, and grew up in a
stable, supportive family environment with his older sister and younger
brother. His upbringing was described as positive, with no history of abuse,
neglect, or child protection involvement. He maintains a close relationship
with his mother, who, along with his siblings, continues to support him through
his recovery from alcohol addiction and legal proceedings.
[
8
]
Mr. Heslip has lived independently in Brampton since August 2022,
following the sale of his parents’ home. He is single, has no children, and
maintains a small but supportive social circle, including two close friends
from elementary school. His mother and friends describe him as kind, sensitive,
and remorseful, noting that the offence was a wake-up call that prompted him to
confront his addiction.
[
9
]
Educationally, Mr. Heslip completed high school and later earned a
two-year business diploma from a local community college. He has a consistent
employment history, having worked in landscaping, court reporting, and most
recently as a full-time labourer at a brick manufacturing plant. His employer
and manager describe him as a valued employee whose performance has
significantly improved since achieving sobriety. Prior to treatment, he
struggled with attendance and focus, but since completing a residential
program, he has demonstrated reliability and motivation.
[
10
]
Mr.
Heslip’s struggles with alcohol began in his early 30s, escalating to daily
consumption of vodka, often up to a full 26-ounce bottle. His addiction led to
seizures, including one at work, and culminated in a serious alcohol-induced
seizure in March 2023 that required hospitalization. This incident was pivotal.
He entered a six-week residential treatment program in April 2023 and has
remained sober since. He continues to participate in a two-year aftercare
program, including regular urine and breath testing, all of which have returned
negative results.
[
11
]
He
has expressed deep remorse for his actions, acknowledging the danger he posed
to himself and others. He stated, “I’m mad at myself and I’m remorseful as I
should have never done that,” and has committed to lifelong sobriety. He no
longer owns a vehicle and uses taxis to commute to work. He has indicated a
willingness to comply with any court-imposed conditions, including restitution,
counselling, and community supervision.
[
12
]
The
pre-sentence report states that Mr. Heslip has shown insight into his
addiction, has taken meaningful steps toward rehabilitation, and is supported
by a stable network of family, friends, and professionals. His risk of
reoffending is low, and community supervision is recommended as an appropriate
and effective sentencing option.
Aggravating and Mitigating Factors:
[
13
]
There were several aggravating factors in this
case, including:
(1)
The extremely high blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) readings.
(2)
Mr. Heslip drove through a red light and was
speeding.
(3)
There was significant property damage.
(4)
He posed a considerable risk to public safety.
[
14
]
I
find the following to be substantial mitigating factors:
(1)
Mr. Heslip is a first-time offender with no
criminal record.
(2)
He completed a 30-day residential treatment
program and has remained sober since March 2023.
(3)
He achieved 24/24 negative urine tests and has
been involved in a two-year aftercare program.
(4)
He has strong support from family and employer.
(5)
The pre-sentence report was highly positive,
recommending community supervision.
(6)
Mr. Heslip has shown insight, remorse, and a
strong commitment to sobriety.
Sentencing
Principles in Impaired Driving Cases involving High BAC and Property Damage:
[
15
]
Sentencing
in impaired driving cases is governed by the overarching principles set out in
sections 718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
. These include denunciation,
deterrence (both general and specific), rehabilitation, proportionality, and
restraint. When the offence involves a high BAC and significant property
damage, courts have consistently emphasized the primacy of denunciation and
deterrence, while still considering the offender’s personal circumstances and
prospects for rehabilitation.
Denunciation
and General Deterrence
[
16
]
The
Supreme Court of Canada has consistently confirmed that denunciation and
general deterrence are the primary sentencing goals in impaired driving cases.
In
R.
v.
Suter
,
2018 SCC 34
, the Court stated at para. 1:
Impaired driving is a serious crime that continues to cause
significant harm in Canadian society. Sentences must reflect society’s
condemnation of this conduct and deter others from engaging in it.
[
17
]
This
principle is particularly important when the offender’s BAC is significantly
elevated and the offence results in property damage or poses a risk to public
safety. The courts have recognized that even in the absence of injury or death,
the potential for catastrophic consequences justifies a firm sentencing
response.
Proportionality
and Moral Blameworthiness
[
18
]
The
principle of proportionality, codified in
s. 718.1
of the
Criminal Code
,
requires
that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree
of responsibility of the offender. In
R.
v.
Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
, the
Court emphasized at para. 12:
The severity of a sentence depends not only on the
seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the moral blameworthiness
of the offender.
[
19
]
A
high BAC is a statutory aggravating factor under
s. 320.22
(f) of the
Criminal Code
,
and courts have treated it as indicative of increased moral blameworthiness.
The presence of significant property damage further aggravates the offence by
demonstrating the real-world consequences of impaired driving.
Individualized
Sentencing and Rehabilitation
[
20
]
While
denunciation and deterrence are paramount, sentencing must remain
individualized and tailored to the specific circumstances of each case.
In
R.
v.
Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5
, the
Court held at paras. 29-30 that:
29.
 The conditional sentence is defined in the
Code
as a sentence of
imprisonment.  The heading of s. 742 reads “Conditional Sentence of
Imprisonment”.  Furthermore, s. 742.1(
a
) requires the court to impose a
sentence of imprisonment of less than two years before considering whether the
sentence can be served in the community subject to the appropriate
conditions.  Parliament intended imprisonment, in the form of
incarceration, to be more punitive than probation, as it is far more
restrictive of the offender’s liberty.  Since a conditional sentence is,
at least notionally, a sentence of imprisonment, it follows that it too should
be interpreted as more punitive than probation.
30.  
On a related note, with the enactment of s. 742.1, Parliament has mandated that
certain non-dangerous offenders who would otherwise have gone to jail for up to
two years now serve their sentences in the community.  If a conditional
sentence is not distinguished from probation, then these offenders will receive
what are effectively considerably less onerous probation orders instead of jail
terms.  Such lenient sentences would not provide sufficient denunciation
and deterrence, nor would they be accepted by the public.
Section 718
provides that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is “to contribute . . . to
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe
society”.  Inadequate sanctions undermine respect for the law. 
Accordingly, it is important to distinguish a conditional sentence from
probation by way of the use of punitive conditions.
[
21
]
This
principle is especially relevant for first-time offenders who have demonstrated
insight, remorse, and a commitment to rehabilitation. Courts must balance the
seriousness of the offence with the offender’s personal circumstances and the
likelihood of reoffending.
Restraint
and the Use of Custodial Sentences
[
22
]
The
principle of restraint, codified in s. 718.2(e), requires that imprisonment be
imposed only when necessary. In
R.
v. Sharma
,
2022 SCC 39
, the Court reaffirmed at para. 2 that:
Sentencing judges must consider all available sanctions
other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances, with
particular attention to the circumstances of Indigenous offenders and others
facing systemic disadvantage.
[
23
]
Although
Sharma
focused
on systemic discrimination, its reaffirmation of restraint applies broadly. In
impaired driving cases, restraint is particularly relevant where the offender
has no prior record, has taken steps toward rehabilitation, and poses a low
risk to public safety.
Crown’s Position and Case Law:
[
24
]
The
Crown relies on several cases to support its position that a custodial sentence
is warranted in Mr. Heslip’s case. These include
R.
v.
Akilan
, 2020 ONCJ
(unreported, dated August 13, 2020);
R.
v.
Wang
, 2019 ONCJ (unreported,
dated February 1, 2019);
R.
v.
Sivanadi
,
2017 ONSC 5740
;
and
R.
v.
Patel
,
2017 ONCJ 728
. While
these cases involve impaired driving with aggravating features such as high
blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) and dangerous driving, they are materially
distinguishable from this case in both factual and rehabilitative dimensions.
[
25
]
In
R.
v.
Akilan
, the offender drove
into a snowbank during a snowstorm, obstructing a live lane of traffic on
Highway 401. His BAC was estimated to be between 160 and 235 mg, and he had his
pregnant wife in the vehicle. Although he had no prior record and was
considered to have strong rehabilitative prospects, the Court emphasized the
danger posed to others and imposed a 30-day intermittent jail sentence with
probation and a driving prohibition. Unlike Mr. Akilan, Mr. Heslip was alone in
the vehicle. He has demonstrated a more extensive and sustained rehabilitative
trajectory, including completion of a residential treatment program and ongoing
aftercare with verified sobriety.
[
26
]
In
R.
v.
Wang
, the offender drove
over a curb and struck unoccupied road repair machinery, causing significant
property damage. His BAC was between 175 and 220 mg, and he had a prior
conditional discharge for dangerous driving involving alcohol. The Court found
that despite Mr. Wang’s post-offence counselling and remorse, a conditional
sentence would not adequately serve the goals of deterrence and denunciation
and imposed a 21-day intermittent jail sentence. Mr. Heslip, by contrast, has
no prior criminal record, and his rehabilitative efforts—documented through a
two-year aftercare program and consistent negative testing—are more robust and
sustained than those in
Wang
.
[
27
]
R.
v.
Sivanadi
involved an
offender who drove erratically with his wife and two young children in the
vehicle, straddling lanes and running a red light. His BAC was 190 mg, and
although there was no collision, the presence of vulnerable passengers and the
risk posed to them were significant aggravating factors. The Court imposed a
30-day intermittent sentence. Mr. Heslip’s case lacks such aggravating
features: he was alone in the vehicle, and while his BAC was high, it was not
accompanied by the same degree of erratic driving or endangerment to others.
[
28
]
Finally,
in
R.
v.
Patel
, the offender passed
out at the wheel with his elderly parents in the car. His BAC was between 330
and 375 mg, placing him near the toxic range. He exhibited gross signs of
impairment, including falling out of the police car and being unable to stand.
The Court emphasized the extraordinary level of impairment and imposed a 45-day
jail sentence. Mr. Heslip’s BAC, while significantly elevated, was lower than
Mr. Patel’s, and he did not exhibit comparable physical symptoms of impairment.
Moreover, Mr. Patel had not yet engaged in meaningful treatment, whereas Mr.
Heslip has completed a residential program and maintained sobriety for over two
years.
[
29
]
These
cases underscore that while impaired driving with a high BAC and property
damage is serious, sentencing must remain individualized. As the Supreme Court
of Canada emphasized in
Lacasse
, proportionality is the “cardinal principle”
of sentencing, requiring that the sentence reflect both the gravity of the
offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Mr. Heslip’s demonstrated
rehabilitation, lack of prior record, and strong community support distinguish
his case from the Crown’s authorities and support the imposition of a non-custodial
sentence.
Defence’s Position and Case Law:
[
30
]
The
Defence relied on several cases that involved an unsuccessful section 12
Charter
challenge to the mandatory minimum sentence under the
Criminal Code
in
support of a non-custodial sentence, specifically an elevated fine and a
driving prohibition.
[
31
]
The
decisions in
R. v. Luke
,
2021 O.J. No. 3068
,
R. v. Pashagumskum-Smoke
,
2020 O.J. No. 5921
and
R. v. Sabattis
,
2020 O.J. No. 2081
, collectively
demonstrate a consistent judicial approach that disfavors custodial sentences
for first-time impaired driving offenders, particularly where significant
mitigating factors are present.
[
32
]
In
R. v. Luke
, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court overturned a conditional
discharge granted by the trial judge but did not impose a custodial sentence.
Instead, the court substituted the mandatory minimum sentence of a $1,000 fine
and a 12-month driving prohibition. The accused was a first-time offender with
a high BAC and a single-vehicle crash. The appellate court emphasized that
while the sentencing judge erred by underemphasizing deterrence and
overemphasizing rehabilitation, the appropriate sentence remained
non-custodial. The Court acknowledged the seriousness of the offence, including
high blood alcohol readings and dangerous driving, but found that the minimum
statutory sentence of a fine and driving prohibition was sufficient to meet the
objectives of denunciation and deterrence.
[
33
]
In
R. v. Pashagumskum-Smoke
, the Court similarly declined to impose custody
despite the offender’s extremely high BAC (280 mg%) and a single-vehicle collision
with a retaining wall. The Court found that a conditional discharge would have
been a just sentence but was precluded by the mandatory minimum sentence under
section 255(1)
(a)(i) of the
Criminal Code
. The judge concluded that the
mandatory minimum was not grossly disproportionate and, therefore, did not
violate section 12 of the
Charter
. The sentence imposed was a $1,000
fine and a driving prohibition, reflecting the Court’s view that rehabilitation
and restorative justice principles—especially in light of the offender’s
Indigenous background and successful completion of treatment—were better served
without incarceration.
[
34
]
In
R. v. Sabattis
, the Court conducted an extensive analysis of both section
12 and section 15
Charter
challenges to the mandatory minimum sentence. The
offender, a young Indigenous woman with no prior record, was convicted of
impaired driving and “over 80” with BAC readings of 210 and 230 mg. She drove
into a ditch while significantly impaired and lost consciousness. The Court
found that although a conditional discharge would have been a fit sentence, the
mandatory minimum precluded it. Nonetheless, the judge imposed a non-custodial
sentence: a $1,200 fine, a 15-month driving prohibition, and two years of
probation with alcohol counselling. The Court emphasized that impaired driving
is a serious offence, but also recognized the mitigating impact of Gladue
factors, including intergenerational trauma and systemic disadvantage. The
judge concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was harsh but not grossly
disproportionate, and that incarceration was not necessary to achieve
sentencing objectives. The Court noted that the public
interest is not served by incarceration where rehabilitation is demonstrably
underway.
[
35
]
Across
all three cases, the courts consistently found that custodial sentences were
not warranted for first-time offenders who demonstrated rehabilitative
potential, had no prior criminal record, and whose offences, while serious, did
not result in bodily harm. The decisions reflect a careful balancing of
denunciation and deterrence with restorative justice and rehabilitation,
particularly in the context of Indigenous offenders. These cases affirm that
the mandatory minimum fine and driving prohibition are generally sufficient to
address the gravity of impaired driving offences in such circumstances, and
that custody should be reserved for more egregious or repeat offences.
[
36
]
However,
an elevated fine would not be appropriate in Mr. Heslip’s case because it would
fail to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence and the principles of
sentencing outlined in the
Criminal Code
. Mr. Heslip’s conduct involved
extremely high blood alcohol levels—over four times the legal limit—and
dangerous driving that resulted in significant property damage. These
aggravating factors demand a sentencing response that emphasizes denunciation
and general deterrence, which a fine alone cannot achieve. Moreover, fines do
not carry the same symbolic weight or rehabilitative structure as a conditional
sentence, especially in cases involving public safety risks.
Conditional Sentence Framework:
[
37
]
Section 742.1
of the
Criminal Code
permits a conditional sentence where:
(1)
The sentence is less than two years'
imprisonment.
(2)
The offender does not pose a danger to the
community.
(3)
The offence does not carry a mandatory minimum
term of imprisonment.
(4)
The offence is not excluded under
s. 742.1
(c) or
(d) of the
Criminal Code
.
[
38
]
These criteria are met. The Crown is not seeking
a sentence of more than two years’ imprisonment. Mr. Heslip’s offence does not
carry a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, and he poses no ongoing risk.
The pre-sentence report confirms his suitability for community supervision.
[
39
]
In
R.
v.
Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5
, the
Supreme Court emphasized that conditional sentences are a form of imprisonment
and can serve as a means of denunciation and deterrence when combined with
appropriate conditions.
[
40
]
The idea that a conditional sentence can still
serve as a means of denunciation and deterrence was recently reaffirmed by the
Court of Appeal in
R.
v.
Habib
,
[2024] O.J. No. 5090
, in footnote
#3, as follow
s:
In contrast,
courts are reluctant to sentence young adults who did not commit a serious
crime involving significant personal violence to prison for their first
criminal offence. Because these offences do not pose the same grave public
safety threat as serious crimes involving significant personal violence,
general deterrence "play[s] little, if any, role" (
Thurairajah
,
at para. 41) and the role of denunciation is also limited. See
R.
v.
Lawrence
(2005),
2005 CanLII 18836 (ON CA)
, 197 O.A.C. 364 (C.A.), at para.
3
. A suspended sentence and probation,
a conditional sentence, or a very short prison term followed by probation best
achieve rehabilitation and specific deterrence in these cases. See
R.
v.
Priest
(1996),
1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA)
, 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at pp. 543-544;
R.
v.
Ijam
,
2007 ONCA 597
, 87 O.R. (3d) 81, at paras.
55-60
.
[
41
]
In
R.
v.
Sharma
, the Supreme Court
struck down legislative restrictions on conditional sentences, reaffirming the
importance of individualized sentencing and the principle of restraint. The
Court emphasized that conditional sentences remain a vital tool for achieving
proportionality and rehabilitation.
Conclusion:
[
42
]
The Crown is correct that impaired driving is a
serious offence that often warrants custodial sentences. However, sentencing
must be individualized and proportionate to the offence.
[
43
]
In my view, Mr. Heslip’s case is not one where
incarceration is necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives. He has already
experienced significant consequences: loss of his vehicle, financial hardship,
and the stigma of conviction. He has accepted full responsibility and made
meaningful changes.
[
44
]
However, imposing a high fine would not
accurately reflect the seriousness of Mr. Heslip’s driving behaviour and his
exceptionally high readings. Relying solely on a fine in such circumstances
would fail to adhere to the fundamental sentencing principles for impaired
driving offences.
[
45
]
A conditional sentence will allow Mr. Heslip to
continue his rehabilitation while serving a sentence that reflects the
seriousness of his offence. He has completed a residential treatment program,
maintained sobriety for over two years, and continues to participate in a
structured aftercare program. The pre-sentence report confirms his low risk of
reoffending and recommends community supervision. It will also serve as a
warning to others that impaired driving carries serious consequences, even when
no one is injured. It also aligns with the principle of restraint, avoiding
unnecessary incarceration for a first-time offender who has demonstrated
genuine remorse and a genuine desire for change.
The Sentence Imposed:
(A)
A Conditional Sentence Order will be for two months (60 days). There
are the following five statutory conditions:
(1)
Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
(2)
Appear before the court when required to do so.
(3)
Report as the Court directs (see Reporting in
the Additional Conditions) in person to a supervisor and thereafter report when
required by the supervisor and in a manner directed by the supervisor.
(4)
Remain in Ontario unless you have prior written
permission from the Court or the supervisor to leave the province.
(5)
Notify the court or supervisor in advance of any
change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or supervisor of any
change in employment or occupation.
(B)
Report to a supervisor immediately, and after that, at all times and
places as directed by the supervisor or any person authorized by a supervisor
to assist you in your supervision.
(C)
For the first month of the Order, you will be confined to your home
except:
(1)
Between noon and 3 pm on Saturdays to acquire
the necessities of life.
(2)
For any medical emergencies involving you or any
member of your immediate family.
(3)
For going directly to and from or being at
employment, religious services and legal, medical or dental appointments.
(4)
You will confirm your schedule in advance with
the supervisor, setting out the times for these activities.
(5)
With the prior written approval of the
supervisor. The written approval is to be carried with you during these times.
(D)
You must present yourself at your doorway upon the request of your
supervisor or a peace officer to verify your compliance with your home
confinement condition.
[
46
]
Pursuant to s. 320.24(2) of the
Code
, you
will be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway
or other public place anywhere in Canada for 18 months. This order is separate
from any driver’s licence suspension that will be imposed under the
Highway
Traffic Act
.
[
47
]
Given Mr. Heslip’s sustained and well-documented rehabilitation,
a probation order with a condition to attend alcohol counselling is unnecessary
and would be redundant. The pre-sentence report confirms that Mr. Heslip has
completed a 30-day residential treatment program, has remained sober for over
two years, and continues to participate in a structured two-year aftercare
program involving regular urine and breath testing—all of which have returned
negative results. He has demonstrated insight into his addiction. Where an
offender has already completed extensive treatment and demonstrated a low risk
of reoffending, sentencing conditions should not be imposed for their own sake
but must be necessary and proportionate. In
Proulx
, the Supreme
Court cautioned against duplicative or unnecessary conditions that do not serve
a rehabilitative or protective function. Considering Mr. Heslip’s progress and ongoing
accountability, further mandated counselling through probation would not
enhance public safety or rehabilitation and would risk undermining the
principle of restraint.
[
48
]
Mr. Heslip, I will give you one year to pay the victim fine
surcharge.
[
49
]
This sentence reflects the seriousness of the
offence while recognizing Mr. Heslip’s significant rehabilitative progress. It balances the principles of denunciation, deterrence, and
rehabilitation, and is consistent with the jurisprudence and the objectives of
the
Criminal Code
