INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
The defendants face a trial on charges that
include possession for the purpose of trafficking and firearms offences.  The
charges stem from the execution of a search warrant.  This, in turn, was part
of a larger investigation involving several police forces in several cities in
Ontario.  On the day set for a motion for leave to cross-examine an affiant,
the Defence requested an order that the Crown provide further disclosure.  I
dismissed that request and heard the scheduled motion. I have concluded that
leave should not be granted to cross-examine the affiant.  These reasons
explain why both motions failed.

In December 2023, the Provincial Joint Forces Cannabis
Enforcement Team (PJFCET) began an investigation into the illegal sale of
cannabis and tobacco from various storefronts using the brand name ‘Indige
Smoke’. None of these establishments were licenced to sell these products under
Provincial or Federal regulations. On March 7, 2024, a series of authorizations
were granted for the search of addresses in Thorold, Welland, and Fort Erie
related to the ‘Indige Smoke’ businesses. Approximately$250,000 worth of
illegal cannabis and tobacco products were seized because of the execution of
these warrants.
[

]
Shortly after these seizures, the police became aware that the
‘Indige Smoke’ locations had reopened and resumed sale of illicit products at
additional locations and identified people, including Andrew Dainard, believed
to be involved in the transport and sale of the contraband.  May 6, 2024,
police were granted a TDR warrant and tracking warrant for the cellular device
and vehicle associated to Mr. Dainard.
[

]
On May 30, 2024, investigators applied for judicial authorization
to search various locations. The application was denied.  The next day, a revised
application was submitted.  This was denied.  Several days later, a third application
was submitted.  This was denied.  On June 4, 2024, a fourth Information To
Obtain (ITO) was submitted and judicial authorization to enter and search nine
(9) locations in relation to six (6) persons of interest was granted. Locations
#1 to #6 were ‘Indige Smoke’ storefronts. Location #7 was a storage unit where Mr.
Dainard, was seen attending. Location #8 was the shared residence of two of the
suspects. Location #9 was identified as the residence of Mr. Dainard located at
7739 Shaw Street, Niagara Falls.
[

]
The Crown alleges that the execution of the search warrant at
7739 Shaw Street resulted in the seizure of these items: approximately 75 grams
of suspected cocaine, digital scales, $1,400 in Canadian currency, a Canuck 12
gauge shotgun, a Keltec Lugar P11 handgun, and approximately 170 rounds of
ammunition. Mr. Dainard and his common law spouse, Sara Manchisi were present
inside the residence and placed under arrest.
[

]
Following several judicial pretrials, these
dates were fixed:
October 23 –
Defence motion for leave to cross-examine the affiant who applied for the
search warrant
November 7
& 17 – Cross-examination of the affiant (if leave is granted) and Garofoli
motion
December 8 to
10 – Trial
[

]
I received written material from the parties
with respect to the first motion.  On October 20, 2025, I communicated with
counsel as follows:
The content of
this email will be put on the record on October 23.   I do not invite a response
to this email from counsel.…..My purpose in communicating with you is to assist
counsel by advising how I intend to proceed with the motion on October 23 so
that the day is effectively used and delay avoided.   I have read the material
filed by the Applicant and Respondent. At paragraph 40 of the Respondent’s
material is a chart setting out a response to each of the grounds relied upon
by the Applicant in seeking leave to cross-examine the affiant.  It appears to
me that the Respondent has fairly set out each of the grounds and I stand to be
corrected by the Applicant. In any event, I propose that the motion begin with
the Applicant replying to each response provided by the Respondent in paragraph
40.
DISCLOSURE MOTION
[
8
]
On October 22, one day before the first
scheduled motion, the Defence brought a disclosure motion asking for all source
documents for all facets of the investigations.  The purpose is to investigate
whether the affiant has made full, fair, and frank disclosure and if the ITO
can support the judicial authorization to search.   I understand that there are
about 50 police officers involved in the investigations.
[

]
Mr. Dainard was initially represented by a
different lawyer.  Months later, he retained current counsel.  On August 11, 2025,
a final judicial pretrial was held between present counsel and Justice
Calderwood.  During discussion of this disclosure motion, I was provided with
an email sent by Justice Calderwood to the parties right after the meeting on
August 11.  The email notes, among other things, that “Disclosure is now
complete” and that Defence counsel had expressed concerns about delay in the
proceedings.  This case was subsequently spoken to in court on August 15,
September 19 and September 24, 2025.  On the latter date, the parties confirmed
readiness to proceed with the schedule of dates set out above.
[
10
]
The Crown’s ongoing disclosure obligation is of
critical importance to the criminal justice system.  Where the parties cannot
resolve disputes, the Defence has a duty to bring any non-disclosure to the
attention of the trial judge in a timely manner:
Report of the Attorney
General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution
Discussions
(Queen’s Printer for Ontario; 1993) at p. 148.
[
11
]
This disclosure request is a last minute one. 
It comes after a judicial pretrial that determined disclosure was complete, and
after the parties confirmed they were ready to proceed to trial.
The
request follows the recent disclosure by the Crown of certain tracking data. 
More significant, perhaps, it comes after the Crown’s written response to the
Defence motion for leave to cross-examine the affiant and my email to the
parties setting out how I proposed to deal with that motion.  In any event, the
disclosure motion, filed in support of a request for leave to cross-examine an
affiant with respect to a judicial order that is presumptively valid, lacks focus. 
To grant this motion would upset the schedule of dates fixed for this trial and
cause delay in a case that is already 17 months old.
[
12
]
In
R v Cody
,
2017 SCC 31 (CanLII)
, the
Supreme Court of Canada emphasized the importance of preventing delay to
“effect real change”, as well as the role to be played by all actors in the
justice system to achieve that goal. The Court stated: “All justice system
participants—defence counsel included—must now accept that many practices which
were formerly commonplace or merely tolerated are no longer compatible with the
right guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the Charter.” The Court also noted the
important role of trial judges in “changing court room culture”, given their
case management powers and control over the conduct of trials.
[

]
I dismissed the disclosure motion.
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE
AFFIANT
[
14
]
Section 8 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
provides
that, "Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or
seizure". Statutory provisions authorizing search or seizure must conform
to this minimum constitutional requirement; namely, "reasonable and
probable grounds, established upon oath, to believe that an offence has been
committed and that there is evidence to be found at the place of search;
R.
v. Morelli
,
2010 SCC 8 (CanLII)
, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253.  The affiant’s subjective belief
in these grounds must be objectively reasonable;
Storrey v. The
Queen
(1990),
1990 CanLII 125 (SCC)
, 53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.).
[
15
]
The application of this standard means that "the state's
interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to prevail over the
individual's interest in being left alone at the point where credibly-based
probability replaces suspicion".  "Mere suspicion, conjecture,
hypothesis or 'fishing expeditions' fall short of the minimally acceptable
standard from both a common law and constitutional perspective;"
R.
v. Sanchez
(1994),
1994 CanLII 5271 (ON SC)
, 93 C.C.C. (3d) 357 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.). On
the other hand, "If the inference of specific criminal activity is a
reasonable inference from the facts, the warrant could be issued;"
R.
v. Jacobson,
2006 CanLII 12292 (ON CA)
, [2006] O.J. No. 1527 (Ont. C.A.).
[
16
]
Most challenges to search warrants address the sufficiency of the
information set out in the ITO.  This is known as an attack on facial validity.
In such cases, the reviewing judge must determine whether there is a basis upon
which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the preconditions for the
granting the warrant existed. This inquiry focusses on the ITO itself. 
Cross-examination of an affiant is relevant only with respect to sub-facial
validity. If it is shown that statements by the affiant in the ITO may not be
accurate, or pertinent information that could have affected issuance of the
order was omitted, cross-examination will be relevant.
[
17
]
Judicial orders are presumptively valid. In challenging a search
warrant, there is no right to cross-examine the affiant. In
Garofoli,
1990 CanLII 52 (SCC)
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, the court held, at paragraphs 88-89:
Leave must be obtained to
cross-examine. The granting of leave must be left to the exercise of the
discretion of the trial judge. Leave should be granted when the trial judge is
satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make
full answer and defence. A basis must be shown by the accused for the view that
the cross-examination will elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence
of one of the preconditions to the authorization, as for example the existence
of reasonable and probable grounds.
[
18
]
The law does not require an applicant to present a
prima
facie
case in support the assertions or make a substantial preliminary
showing of fraud or recklessness on the part of the affiant. However, an applicant
must point to the evidentiary basis to justify cross-examination:
R. v.
Ambrose
,
1994 CanLII 1378 (ON CA)
, [1994] O.J. No. 1457 (OCA). This prevents "fishing
expeditions". Merely pointing to omissions,
inconsistencies, and conclusory statements, does not justify cross-examination.
The applicant must show how these errors discredit the original grounds for
issuance of the warrant. Where there is an error in the ITO, the applicant must
also demonstrate that there is a basis to support the inference that the
affiant knew or ought to have known that the information was false in preparing
the ITO.  Similarly, it is not sufficient for the applicant to merely question
the credibility of the affiant. Such a challenge must be in relation to an
essential element of the ITO and cast such doubt that the reliability of the
affidavit is tainted:
R. v. Reid
,
2017 ONCA 430
, at para.
17
;
R. v.
Lucas
,
2014 ONCA 561
, at para.
147
.
[
19
]
In
R v. Pires; R. v. Lising
,
2005 SCC 66 (CanLII)
, [2005] 3
S.C.R 343 the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on the test for leave
to cross-examine. The Court explained that the Garofoli review did not involve
testing the merits of the case or the truth of the allegations. Rather, the
review was an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence
obtained pursuant to a presumptively valid court order. There is only a narrow
set of circumstances in which a valid judicial authorization will be set aside.
As a result, leave to cross-examine will only be permitted in similarly narrow
cases: “The reason that the test will generally leave just a narrow window for
cross-examination is not because the test is onerous -- it is because there is
just a narrow basis upon which an authorization can be set aside”. The Court
also noted that the leave requirement strikes an appropriate balance between
the entitlement to cross- examination as an aspect of the right to make full
answer and defence, and the public interest in the fair, but efficient, use of
judicial resources and the timely determination of criminal proceedings: paragraphs
3, 30, 31, and 40.
[
20
]
Where leave is granted to cross-examine an
affiant, it must be restricted to questions that will elicit evidence tending
to undermine one or more of the preconditions for the issuance of the warrant. 
This necessarily excludes cross-examination on peripheral matters unrelated to
the grounds for issuance. As the Supreme Court in
Pires
and
Lising
explained, at paragraph
10
: “When permitted, the cross-examination should be
limited by the trial judge to questions that are directed to establish that
there was no basis upon which the authorization could have been granted…”
[
21
]
The record before me on the motion for leave to
cross-examine the affiant includes the 87-page ITO in question as well as the
three tracking data analyst reports and surveillance reports for March 26 – 27,
April 23, and May 9, 2024, that are referenced in that ITO.

Below is a chart prepared by the Crown setting
out its response to each the grounds relied upon by the applicants.  In
addition, I have the benefit of a further written reply by the applicants and
oral submissions by the parties.

This portion of the affidavit seeks authorization to search the
  cellular device(s), computers, or other media storage devices belonging to
  the accused for evidence of involvement with
the illicit sale of cannabis. In particular, it targets devices
  capable of being used to “facilitate orders

“Master
Case”
as
a
term
of
art.
The Applicant proposes to
amplify the record to show that “Master Case” is not a term of
  art which can confirm illegality pursuant to s.121.1(1) of the CC and
  resulted in the issuing justice being
mislead
regarding
whether
a legal
  violation had occurred.
The

Para
13
Daman Bhutta provides a number of charts with color coded
  designations
and
time
assessments which do not disclose the manner in which the tracking
  occurs and which are not supported by sourcing documents sufficient to
  explain the color coding, the time signatures, or the justification for why
certain
time
signatures
do
not
  match physical surveillance testified to by other sub-affiants including an
  assertion that Andrew Dainard was not in Canada for a period of the
tracking warrant. As such, the
  interpretation of the tracking data by the affiant is conclusory and
  speculative without explanation.
Paragraph 13 contains only two sentences, identifying that a previous
  TDR and tracking
warrant
was
authorized
in
relation
  to Andrew DAINARD.
The Applicant may be speaking of paragraphs 58-60.
  These paragraphs contain two charts of tracking data associated
to
DAINARD’s
cellular
device. The charts are sourced to reports authored by
OPP
Analyst
Daman
Bhutta
on
May
29 and 30, 2024. An affiant’s note following paragraph
60
explains
that
there
is
a
gap
in the data between May 13 and 20, 2024
  as police had reason to believe DAINARD was out of the jurisdiction on those
  dates.
The
Applicant
had
provided
no
evidentiary
  basis to conclude any of this evidence was misleading or included material
inconsistencies.
There
are
no
observations
of
DAINARD
in the ITO which conflict with the
  Affiant’s stated belief that he was not in the jurisdiction between May
  13-20, 2024
The
charts
are
coloured
coded
for
ease
of review
and
the
affiant
does
not
proport
to attribute any meaning to the colours utilized. There is no basis to
  believe questioning the affiant on the colour scheme could undermine the
  grounds for
issuance.
The Applicants assert that the tracking data,
obtained
under
judicial
authorization, is ‘conclusory and
  speculative without explanation’. Merely asserting a statement is conclusory,
  without demonstrating material errors or identifying how the grounds for
  issuance are discredited, is
insufficient.

Para 16-
21
The Applicant intends to amplify the record to show that the affiant
  deliberately adjusted the ITO in a manner
that
resulted
in
the
issuing justice being mislead regarding
  the grounds. For example, the temporal link between the
Applicant’s
residence
and
the impugned activity was
The Affiant clearly
  sets out the history of prior, rejected applications in accordance with his
  obligations. The Affiant demonstrates good faith by acknowledging certain
weaknesses
in
the
previous
omnibus application and amending the authorization sought
  accordingly.
The
Affiant
further
attempts
to
respond
to
significantly
weaker
than
outlined

the
ITO
but

affiant
writes
in the final ITO that they agree with the prior Justice regarding
  sufficiency of grounds on a separate location
the concerns of the Justice by supplementing
the
information
provided
in the affidavit. This is entirely consistent with the
  purpose of the procedure: to ensure potential deficiencies identified by the
  Issuing Justice have been rectified.

Paras
22(b),
29(i),
30(b),
34(a),
The sub-affiants did not observe any unstamped or unpackaged tobacco.
  The affiant alters the language
in
s.121.1
to
impugn
any “tobacco” with the proviso that
  certain tobacco is “illegal or unlicensed tobacco” without any explanation of
  how s.121.1 of the CC has been violated. The sub- affiants
do
not
describe
any
illegal tobacco
  whatsoever and the
affiant does not
  explain this.
The Affiant makes clear that the ‘Indige Smoke’ locations, frequented
  by DAINARD, publicly advertise the sale of cannabis
and
tobacco
products:
see
affiant note
  following para. 33(c), 74.
These stores were not authorized vendors of cannabis
  products pursuant to Health Canada or the Alcohol and Gaming Commission
of
Ontario
(AGCO):
para.
14,
70-71.
Warrants previously executed at the same storefronts resulted in
  location of large quantities of illicit tobacco and cannabis products: paras.
  12, 75(b). Surveillance revealed persons leaving the storefronts in
  possession
of
tobacco
products:
para.
34(a), 48(b), 75(c). Photographs are
  included to permit the Issuing Justice to undertake his/her own analysis.
The Affiant explicitly sets out the provisions of
  the
Criminal Code
and addresses the question of whether the tobacco
products
are
stamped:
para.
75
(a)- (d),
80
, affiant note following 45(n).
In addition to the paragraphs identified by the
  Applicants, the Affiant further sets out surveillance observations of DAINARD
  carrying
apparent
cannabis
into
the
‘Indigo Smoke’ locations at 264 King St,
  Welland and 30 Albert St. East, Thorold: see para. 53(g) and 53(j).
It
should
be
noted
the
subject

was not being searched for tobacco

the
record
to
show
that these
paragraphs
are
unreliable and inaccurate:
•
the
sub-affiants
could
not
have

what
the
affiant
describes
The Applicant has not tendered any supporting
  evidence to demonstrate inconsistencies between the source document
(Surveillance
Report
of
DC Bezzo,
dated
March
26,
2024)
and
the
  content of the Affidavit.
because
  the affiant swears to an employee entrance to a premises without any such
  entrance, describes boxes as “heavy” with no justification from sub-affiant
  notes or reports,
and
describes
losing
a subject in
  an area where visibility extends for kilometers in all directions.
•
Despite, these comments, the Affiant proposes that
  the only explanation for the physical surveillance
is
Andrew
Dainard’s involvement in a trafficking
operation.
•
The Applicant proposes to amplify the record to show
  that the discrepancies in physical surveillance and what was ultimately
  communicated to the issuing
justice
resulted
in
extreme
  confusion for the issuing justice
This
report
reads,
in
part:
At 10:46am, Andrew DAINARD is observed exiting the
  employee doors of Indige Smoke Thorold with a box that appears heavy. DAINARD
  is observed wearing an orange construction shirt and loads
the
box
into
the
rear
driver’s
side
of the Black
  Acura KAS 85.
This
is
the
very
language
impugned
by
the Applicants. It has been taken
  verbatim from the Surveillance Report source document. No inconsistency has
  been demonstrated. An affiant is permitted to rely on the reports of other
  officers as accurate and trustworthy.
The
source
document
further
reads:
“11:04 – DAINARD observed exiting the rear
of
Indige
Smoke
St.
Catharines,
enters KAS 85 Acura and away”
“11:30
–
DAINARD
lost
in
surveillance
in the area of Clendenning Street at Dores Drive, Niagara
  Falls”
The report makes it clear that mobile surveillance
  is being undertaken. A target may be ‘lost’ even in areas of high visibility.
  Any cross-examination on this point would be wholly unrelated to the grounds
for
issuance
and
may
well
violate
  investigative technique privilege.
The
  Applicants have demonstrated no inconsistencies
between
the
surveillance reports and the affidavit.

Para
51(c),
(j)
The Applicant proposes to amplify
the
record
to
show:
•
The conclusory
and unsourced nature
of
the
term
“Master
Case” and the replacement of this term
  later in the ITO with “cardboard box” without explanation.
•
The
affiant
swears
that
no
direct surveillance is
  possible at 7739 Shaw but here concludes with certainty that Dainard attends
  at this
location
with
no
support
from the tracking data or sub-affiant
notes.
The Applicants have provided no evidentiary
basis
to
assert
inconsistencies striking at the heart of issuance.
The term “master case” is taken directly from the
  language used in the source documents,
the
Surveillance
Reports
of
DC Cole and DC Sebaaly.
The term “master case” is used in three paragraphs
  of the ITO: paras. 45(n, v, x), 51(c), and
54(c, f). The first time the term is
used,
the
Affiant
provides
the
following
description:
At
1319
hrs
Sadiku
and
Nikanorov
arrived at "lndige Smoke"
  located at 1318
Dominion Road, in
  the city of Fort Erie.
They
are
observed
carrying
two
cardboard "master cases"
,
  the grey rubber tote and toilet paper from the car into the store.
The
  Affiant goes on to note that similar boxes
had
been
located
during
the
previous warrant executions at ‘Indige
  Smoke’ locations: para. 45(n) Affiant note.
The term “master case” is
used a second time in para. 45(v). A photograph of the box
is
included
for
review
by
the
Issuing Justice: para. 45.
The
term
is
again
used
in
para.
51.
Again,
a photograph
  accompanies the description to permit the Justice to come to his/her own
determination.
The
term
is
finally
used
in
para.
54.
Again, a
photograph
accompanies
the
description.
There is no reasonable possibility the Justice was
  misled or confused by the use of
this
term.
In
all
cases,
the
use
of
the
term “master case” is accompanied by a
  photograph depicting a large, rectangular cardboard box.
The
Affiant’s
use
of
this
term
had
no impact on the grounds for issuance.
Further, the Applicant has shown no inconsistency on
  the issue of surveillance. At para. 51(j), the Affiant notes that DAINARD
  returned to his residence. The Surveillance
Report
source
document
reads in part:
At 1218hrs DAINARD returns to his residence

  the individual under surveillance (DAINARD) had attended a licenced

the
Applicants
have led no evidence to support this
  assertion.
The Affiant sets out DAINARD’s attendance at 264
  King St, Welland, 30 Albert St East, Thorold, and 363 Vine Street,
St.
Catharines.
These
addresses
are identified as
  ‘Indige Smoke’ storefronts. The ITO sets out that none of these locations is
  authorized to sell cannabis or tobacco products: paras. 14, 70-71.
Paragraph 59(k) of the Affidavit states that DAINARD
  attended Canna Cabana Store, located at 7555 Montrose Rd, Niagara Falls. No
  suggestion is made that this store was involved in illicit activities. The
  affidavit is consistent with the source documents,
namely
the
Surveillance
Report of DC Walsh. The disclosure is full, frank, and fair.
The
Applicant
has
not
articulated
any
way
  in which inclusion of this observation undermines the grounds for issuance.

Para
59
These charts are not based on any disclosed sourcing material and
  contain amendments which are unclear – we don’t know whether the sub-affiant
  or the affiant highlighted
these
or
who
made
the calculations regarding location and time including variance
  settings for the location settings given the proximity of the subject’s gym
  to the impugned locations. The Applicant seeks to amplify the record to show
  that a significant portion of the impugned “visits” to cannabis stores were
  in fact visits to a gym based on the material in Bhutta’s
report.
The Applicant has demonstrated no
  material
misrepresentations
or
errors
by
the
  Affiant or sub-affiant.
The Applicants have not provided an evidentiary
  basis for asserting that the data included at para 59 is inaccurate or
  misleading.
Seeking
to
question
the
Affiant
  or sub-Affiants about the data in the hopes of discovering an inconsistency
  is the definition of a fishing expedition.
In particular, the Applicants assert that the
  Tracking Warrant data may be inaccurate because DAINARD’s gym was located in
  close proximity to other target locations. First, this is purely speculative.
  Second, it is
important
to
note
that
only
one
(1)
of
the
  nine
(9)
locations
identified
in
the
ITO
was
  located in the same city as DAINARD’s gym (St. Catharines). On at least one
  occasion, contemporaneous surveillance confirmed the accuracy of the Tracking
Data
in
relation
to
that
specific
location (383 Vine St, STC): see Surveillance
Report
dated
May
9,
2024.
The Applicants
have
  tendered nothing
in support
of
the
assertion
that
the
Tracking Data may be inaccurate or
  incapable of discerning between locations (ie. No affidavit from an expert, etc.).
The
Respondent
respectfully
submits
that, to
  the extent the Applicants were missing source documentation, the appropriate
  action would be a disclosure request.

Para
63(b)
The affiant changes
  the language for “master case” without explanation resulting in
confusion and potentially misleading
  the issuing
justice.
The
Applicant
also seeks
  excision if amplification is not sufficient to cure the defect.
The
Respondent
has
already
addressed
the issue of the term “master case” above. In each instance,
  the Affiant was borrowing the language of the source document
author.
In paragraph 63, the Affiant describes the item in
  his own words as “a box”.
There is
  no material inconsistency in this. The multiple
photographs
embedded
in
the
ITO make clear what item(s) are being
  referred
to.
11
Para
71(a)
There is no query regarding the Applicant’s licensure and no inquiry
  regarding whether or not licensing
existed
for
the
storage
of cannabis or tobacco at the Applicant’s home. The affiant’s
  material here misleads the issuing justice and the Applicant seeks to amplify
the
record
to
show
that
no inquiry at all was made regarding 7739 Shaw and whether cannabis or
  tobacco was allowed to be stored there
The Affiant dedicates an entire section of the ITO to this issue,
  under the heading: “Health Canada Licence and Registration Inquiries”: paras.
  70-71. This section clearly sets out which locations and individual
licences
had
been
checked
with Health
Canada.
Nothing
in
the
contents
of these paragraphs is misleading.
The Affiant was made aware of correspondence from
  Heath Canada advising
that
Andrew
DAINARD
was
not authorized to sell cannabis
  products.
The application seeks to search the target residence
  at 7739 Shaw St for various items
related
to
the
illicit
sale
of
cannabis, not storage.
The
building
at
7739
Shaw
St
is
a
private
  residence, not a commercial property. It would not meet the criteria
  necessary to obtain a commercial sale licence.

  than
the
clear
language
in
s.121.1.
The Affidavit includes a screenshot of the website for ‘Indige
  Smoke’, offering the sale
of
tobacco

cannabis
products.
The image

includes

company’s locations, none of which hold

The Affiant further provides additional screenshots
from
the
website
at
Appendix
D.
The Affiant does not purport to attribute ownership of the website to
  any specific, named individual. The ownership of the domain
does
not
factor
into
the
grounds
for issuance
and
thus
seeking
to
elicit
evidence about same could not risk undermining the decision of the
  Issuing Justice.
The ITO must be read as a whole, including
the
paragraphs
which
explain
the Affiant’s belief that unlicenced cannabis and tobacco
  will be found at the storefront locations, and the Affiant’s belief the documentation
  and other evidence associated to the sale of cannabis will be found at the
  residence on Shaw Street.

The Applicant will seek to amplify the record to
  show that the

order
was
unnecessary and misled
  the issuing justice regarding the “secrecy” of the materials in the ITO.
Informations to Obtain are filed with the Court as
  part of an ongoing investigation. These documents can, and must, remain
  private
until
the
successful
execution
of
the issued
  warrants. Disallowing sealing orders, especially in complex, multi- jurisdictional
  investigations, would seriously and unnecessarily risk the integrity of
  police efforts.
Even if a sealing order were deemed unnecessary in a
  particular case, questioning
an
Affiant
on
their
opinion
as to
the
need
for

[

I conclude that the response by the Crown
correctly explains why leave should not be granted to cross-examine the affiant;
that is, the applicants have not identified any area in which the affiant
failed in his obligation to be full, frank, and fair or demonstrated that the
ITO contained material misrepresentations, errors, or omissions which risked
undermining the grounds for issuance or the order.
[
24
]
In coming to this conclusion, I am not troubled
by the reply to that response by the applicants. I will note a few specific areas
of concern that the applicants focussed upon in their reply, before dealing
with their primary, more general, submission.
[
25
]
The applicants’ reply to the Crown response in
point no. 1 is that there is no physical surveillance that connects Mr. Dainard
to the assertions in the ITO with respect to Location # 9 and that the affiant
knew there was no such link.  This ignores the context for the affiant’s
assertions as set out in paragraph 191 of the ITO as well as the surveillance
report dated April 23, 2024 at 2:15 pm; Mr. Dainard is seen with a clear bag
that appears to contain cannabis and there is a camera monitoring the
residence.
[
26
]
With respect to points no. 2, 7, and 8, the
applicants maintain that the phrase “master case” is a term of art the affiant
was not entitled to use.  The phrase was taken directly from the surveillance
reports of DC Cole and DC Sebaaly.  As such, whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the issuing justice could have been confused by this phrase is
a matter for argument with respect to facial validity, not cross-examination
with respect to sub-facial validity.
[
27
]
In point no. 3, the applicants question how the colour
coded charts in the ITO are presented and what they refer to.  These charts are
also referenced in point no. 9.  They are explained by the tracking data and
the conversion of the GPS coordinates to municipal addresses.  In their reply,
the applicants quarrel with the fact that this conversion was conducted.  They
also assert that this tracking data is at odds with statements in the ITO and
misleading in that it does not clarify that Mr. Dainard could have been at a
gym adjacent to the place under surveillance.  I do not understand why
converting the data to municipal addresses and linking it to the surveillance
reports is an issue.  In any event, whether the impugned statements in the ITO can
be reasonably inferred from the surveillance reports is a matter that is properly
addressed in the attack on facial validity.
[
28
]
The applicants reply, with respect to point no.
5, that the affiant misled the issuing justice by referring to
s. 121.1
of the
Criminal Code
when “he knew that he was really describing a provincial stamping
offence”. However, the ITO, at paragraph 75, reproduces
s. 121.1
for the
judicial officer to read and consider.  The applicants also maintain that the
photographs referenced in point no. 5 do not support the affiant’s assertions –
that the boxes carried by Mr. Dainard were “heavy” and that he was subsequently
lost in surveillance.  However, again, these statements are taken from the
surveillance reports.
[
29
]
The primary reply by the applicants to the Crown
response goes back to the disclosure motion.  Counsel for both applicants
repeated the need for all source documents for all facets of the several investigations. 
Their submission, in other words, is that this could enable them to successfully
reply to Crown response and show why leave should be granted to cross-examine
the affiant.  I have explained why the disclosure motion failed.
[
30
]
The second motion fails because the applicants have
not shown that the proposed cross-examination could elicit evidence
tending to discredit the preconditions for the issuance of the search warrant. 
That they identified areas they hoped would accomplish this objective is not
enough.  In this regard, I note the comments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
in
R. v. Washington
,
1997
CanLII 3968
(ONCA):
In our view,
the trial judge was correct in denying the request for leave to cross-examine
the affiant and the sub-affiants. The purpose of the request was to enable the
defence to see whether the proposed cross-examinations might disclose evidence
that would be of assistance in their ultimate attack on the Watt J's
authorization. This was in the nature of a "fishing expedition".
[

My comments in this decision are not necessarily
relevant to the attack on facial validity.  That motion will be heard at the
next stage of these proceeding.
