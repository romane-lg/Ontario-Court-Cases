INTRODUCTION
[

]
Samer Akila is charged with possessing
psilocybin (a Schedule III substance) for
the purpose of trafficking
contrary
to
s. 5(2)
of the
Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act
(CDSA).
Th
e charge relates to his involvement in the
operation of a
psilocybin
dispensary under the name
Fun Guyz
located at 256 Richmond Street,
London ON.
[

]
By way of Notice of Constitutional
Question (
NCQ
) filed pursuant to
s. 109
of the
Courts of Justice Act
,
R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (
CJA
) he
challenges
the constitutionality of
s. 5
of the
CDSA
as it relates to psilocybin alleging it violates both the
right to freedom of thought under
s. 2
(b) and the liberty and security of the
person under s. 7 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(the “
Charte
r”).
[
3
]
Although the applicant claims no personal
interest in possessing or consuming psilocybin, he submits that the prohibition
on trafficking infringes the rights of others to access it for its thought-related
benefits.
[
4
]
He submits that these violations
cannot be justified under
section 1
of the
Charter
and asks
that I find
s. 5
of the
CDSA
constitutionally invalid in this case
.
[1]
Alternatively, he seeks a remedy under
s. 24(1)
of the
Charter.
[
5
]
For the reasons below, I find that
s. 5(2)
of
the
CDSA
does not infringe
sections 2(b)
or
7
of the
Charter
.

]
The Crown called the following 3 witnesses:
(i)
Dr. Joshua Rosenblat, a qualified expert in the
fields of psychiatry and psychopharmacology;
(ii)
Jennifer Pelley, the Director of the Office of
Regulatory Affairs (Health Canada); and
(iii)

Program (Health Canada).
Agreed
Statement of Fact
[
9
]
The facts giving rise to the offence before the
court are set out in an Agreed Statement of Fact (“
ASF
”) filed by the
parties.
[
10
]
On May 11, 2023,
Samer Akila was interviewed by CTV London about the imminent launch of
Fun Guyz
,
an illegal psilocybin dispensary located at 256 Richmond Street, London ON (“
Fun
Guyz
”). The interview, a copy of which the parties attached as an appendix
to the
ASF
, took place inside the
Fun Guyz
store where Mr. Akila
was speaking as a spokesperson for the company and wearing company
paraphernalia. During the interview, he said the following:
(i)
“What we’re doing is completely illegal.”;
(ii)
“We’re aware of it. There’s not much they can
do.”;
(iii)
“What we’re doing is a medical protest, it’s
an act of disobedience in order to get magic mushrooms legalized.”;
(iv)
“As soon as they [police] leave the store
we’ll be in there with product, opening…”;
(v)
“We’ve already been through six raids. St.
Catharines, Niagara, Barrie, Bradford, Danforth in Toronto. It’s going to be
very hard
to stop us.”;
(vi)
“It's currently illegal in Ontario, and we do
not have a business licence."; and
(vii)
“We are trying to help people and give them
access that the government can’t provide.”
[
11
]
On May 12, 2023,
Fun
Guyz
opened for business. At all relevant times,
Fun Guyz
maintained
a website advertising and selling psilocybin products. As a result of all the
foregoing, police opened an investigation into illegal psilocybin trafficking.
[
12
]
On May 17, 2023, an
undercover police officer entered the store and purchased 7 grams of psilocybin
for $60.00 from store employee Kadeem Wilson.
[
13
]
Also on May 17, 2023,
police were conducting physical surveillance of
Fun Guyz
and observed
several customers entering and exiting the store.
[
14
]
On June 5, 2023,
police executed a
CDSA
search warrant and found the following contraband
inside the store:
(i)
113 packages of psilocybin edibles
(psilocybin chocolate and gummies);
(ii)
798 grams of psilocybin in dried mushroom form;
(iii)
1,920 psilocybin "micro-dosing" pills; and
(iv)
11 bags of psilocybin in drink powder form (psilocybin tea
and hot chocolate).
[
15
]
The estimated retail
value of the seizure (based on pricing advertised on the
Fun Guyz
website) was approximately $17,000.00.
[
16
]
Mr. Akila admits that on the date of the above noted interview, he
was in possession of psilocybin for the purpose of trafficking. Specifically, he
admits that on that date he was in possession of psilocybin inventory of
substantially the same nature, quantity, quality, and value as outlined above and
that it was possessed for the purpose of trafficking.
[
17
]
Photographs taken
during the execution of the June 5, 2023 search warrant and photographs of the
seized exhibits were also attached as an appendix to the
ASF
.
Civilian Witnesses
[
18
]
At the request of counsel for the applicant and
without objection from the Crown, I agreed to identify the civilian witnesses
by their initials to preserve their privacy.
A.C.
[
19
]
A.C.
is  36 years of age.
[
20
]
He is a board member of Mapping the Mind, a registered but
inactive organization that previously hosted psychedelic science conferences
from 2017 to 2019. He clarified that his testimony was not connected to the
organization and that he is not currently involved in any other related groups.
He does not own or operate any psilocybin-related business.
[
21
]
A.C.
first experimented with psilocybin as a teenager
growing up in rural Spain. He described his childhood as anxious, insecure, and
emotionally repressed. He struggled with mental health and identity,
particularly during adolescence and early adulthood.
[
22
]
His first experience led to profound emotional insights,
including compassion for others and a reevaluation of his relationship with his
father and himself.
[
23
]
He continues to use psilocybin occasionally in Canada with a
small group of friends, typically two to three times per year for introspection
and emotional connection.
[
24
]
He has tried MDMA (5–6 times) and LSD
(twice) but prefers psilocybin for its introspective qualities and shorter
duration. He finds psilocybin tends to result in “less visuals
and more intense thought stimulation and an increased capacity to evaluate and
examine myself.”
[2]
[
25
]
He views psilocybin as a tool for emotional healing, helping him
build empathy, self-compassion, and overcoming feelings of inadequacy. It has
also enabled him to express emotions more freely and become more forgiving of
himself and others.
[
26
]
He also sees psilocybin as a path to spiritual growth, describing
divine experiences that foster a sense of universal connection. These
encounters deepened his appreciation for Christian values like love and
forgiveness, led him to attend Catholic Mass more sincerely, and enriched his
familial and cultural connections.
[
27
]
A.C.
has not attempted to access psilocybin through legal
channels. He  referenced clinical trials and exemptions under
s. 56
of the
CDSA
but admitted having limited knowledge in this regard.
D.S.
[
28
]
D.S.
is 52 years
old. He resides with his wife and 4 children.
[
29
]
He is a community organizer affiliated with multiple psychedelic
advocacy groups, including Etheogenic Research Guild of Toronto (ERGOT), the
Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge and Guelph (KWCG) Psychedelic Society and the
Toronto Psychedelic Society. He confirmed that his involvement in psychedelic
advocacy is longstanding and significant, describing it as a personal and
community-focused pursuit. He does not own, operate, or work for any business
involved in the cultivation or sale of psilocybin.
[
30
]
He consumes psilocybin in mushroom form, sometimes processed into
chocolates for dosing consistency. He does not use psilocybin when responsible
for his children, citing safety concerns and dose-dependent effects.
[
31
]
His first transformative psychedelic experience was with LSD at
age 23, which led him to prefer psilocybin due to its shorter duration. He also
emphasized the difficulty of determining LSD dosage due to its potency and
unreliable sourcing, contrasting it with psilocybin, which is easier to dose
accurately and more readily available. He explained that tolerance to
psilocybin builds quickly, requiring a break between doses to maintain
efficacy. He distinguished between full doses and microdosing, noting the
latter does not produce noticeable effects.
[
32
]
D.S.
stated he uses psilocybin primarily for spiritual
purposes. Raised in the Catholic faith, he found traditional religious
practices lacking in depth and turned to psilocybin for spiritual connection. He
described early transformative experiences with LSD and psilocybin, noting
spiritual and therapeutic impacts.
[
33
]
He regards psilocybin as a sacrament and a divine gift, enabling
reconnection with his soul and a sense of unity with nature and humanity.
Psilocybin facilitated ego dissolution, increased empathy, and enhanced
mindfulness. It helped him move away from materialism and toward introspection,
creativity, and emotional healing. He believes psilocybin allows individuals to
re-evaluate personal values and biases authentically and credits psilocybin
with making him a more compassionate and mindful parent.
[
34
]
He discussed legal access to psilocybin, referencing the
Special
Access Program
(SAP) administered through the Ministry of Health and
exemptions under
s. 56
of the
CDSA
. He acknowledged not pursuing legal
access due to lack of qualifying medical conditions and skepticism about
spiritual exemptions.
S.L.
[
35
]
S.L.
is 44 years
of age. She resides in Toronto and is a Board Member of the Psychedelic
Association of Canada (PAC), an educational organization with an emphasis
on destigmatizing psychedelics especially psilocybin and MDMA.
Her motivation for joining PAC was to share her story and support
others, especially in light of mental health challenges in Canada. She has had
a long-standing career in public relations and communications where she has
held several executive positions. She does not own or operate
any psilocybin related business.
[
36
]
S.L. told the court about her personal experience with psilocybin
therapy and its impact on her mental health and well-being.
[
37
]
In her affidavit, she disclosed a history of trauma due to
emotional abuse by a parental figure. Having undergone almost
two decades of talk therapy, she felt she continued to struggle on a
subconscious level with unresolved issues resulting in fear, doubt, and shame.
She had previously taken antidepressants as a teenager and indicated that her
mother and her mother’s three sisters had been on antidepressants for some time
as well.
[
38
]
In 2022 she sought out the assistance of
The
Synthesis Institute (Synthesis),
an organization operating in the
Netherlands which offers professionally guided retreats using psilocybin. She
has since attended two retreats, one in October of 2022 and one in August of
2023.
[
39
]
She described a rigorous application process for the retreat,
including detailed questions on physical and mental health, drug history, and
therapeutic background. This was followed by three weeks of preparation via
Zoom prior to her departure for the Netherlands.
[
40
]
She said the retreats were highly structured, safe, and
supervised, with facilitators including psychologists, psychiatrists,
Indigenous guides, and a paramedic.
[
41
]
During her first retreat in October of 2022, she underwent two
psilocybin ceremonies during a five-day stay (with doses of 5g and
approximately 20g of truffles), and three weeks of integration post-retreat.
While under the influence of psilocybin, she described meeting, interacting
with, and consoling her younger self and having memories of events that she
believed she unknowingly repressed as a way of protecting her consciousness
self. She described how “in an instant” she returned to the present day where
she saw her best friend, her mother, brother, and other close friends all
standing before her. She described how she witnessed herself through the eyes
of those that loved her most and how this transformed her own sense of
self-worth and intrinsic value. She said her increased sense of self-worth has
continued since that time.
[
42
]
She said her second retreat in August of 2023 was drastically
different. She said she wasn’t experiencing anything recognizable in terms of
people, places or memories but was in a vast inanimate space where she
experienced a sense of discomfort and underwent a complete “ego dissolution.”
She says she lost any understanding of who, what or where she was. She said a
shapeless energy appeared before her which she interpreted to be the parental
figure from her traumatic past. She said she was able to forgive them for the
pain they had caused her.
[
43
]
S.L.
says that
her experiences with psilocybin have allowed her to be more authentic and less
pressured to please those around her. She says that she now has a newfound
sense of peace and self-assurance and that this empowered her to break free
from a job that provided financial security but left her feeling empty. She
says psychedelic therapy has allowed her to become more connected to people, nature,
and the universe.
[
44
]
She said she has never applied and exemption through the
SAP
or clinical trials and remains unfamiliar with s. 56 exemptions.
Expert Evidence
The Nature of Psilocybin
[
45
]
The evidence with respect to the nature of psilocybin is not in
dispute.
[
46
]
Psilocybin is a psychoactive substance commonly found in magic mushrooms
although it can also be created in synthetic form. When consumed, it is
metabolized into psilocin which primarily activates the serotonin 2A receptor
in the brain.
[
47
]
When taken in sufficient quantity, psilocybin produces an altered
state of consciousness commonly referred to as a “psychedelic trip.” The
effects as reported in clinical trials include visual and auditory
hallucinations, an altered perception of time and space, emotional
breakthroughs and enhanced introspection and cognitive flexibility.
[
48
]
A psychedelic dose is typically defined as 2 grams or more dried
mushrooms or 15 mg or more pure psilocybin. Effects begin within 15 to 45
minutes and generally last between four and six hours and sometimes up to eight
hours.
[
49
]
Disagreement among the experts centred on
psilocybin’s safety and efficacy.
Applicant’s Experts
Professor Lucas Swaine
[
50
]
Professor Swaine has a background in philosophy and political
science, having obtained a Doctorate in Philosophy from the University of
Sussex in 1995 and a PhD in Political Science at Brown University in 1999. He
has been a professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth College since
2001 where he is presently the Department Chair. He has taught numerous courses
which touch on political theory and philosophy as they pertain to fundamental
freedoms, including freedom of thought and related international conventions.
He has also written extensively in the area of freedom of thought from a
political and philosophical perspective and in 2001 was among a number of
scholars consulted by the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or
Belief.
[
51
]
On
consent, Professor Swaine was qualified to give expert evidence on thought, the
history of thought, freedom of thought, the history of freedom of thought,
liberties and freedoms as understood by philosophers and contained within
international conventions.
[
52
]
Council were in agreement that Professor Swaine
was not an expert on Canadian law and should not be permitted to opine on how
these rights and freedoms should be interpreted by the court given that this is
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court.
[
53
]
Professor Swaine defines “thought” to include
“mental activity” in order to accommodate a broad spectrum of mental processes
which would include feelings as well as “reasoning, reflecting, imagining,
cogitating, remembering, wishing, questioning, desiring, believing,
deliberating, and other activities of the mind.”
[3]
[
54
]
He distinguishes thought from speech and conduct
given that a person can think or feel without expressing or acting upon one’s
thoughts or emotions. This he says is consistent with what John Stuart Mill
describes in “On Liberty” as the “inward domain of consciousness.” In this
sense, his definition of thought excludes forms of expression.
[
55
]
He also indicated that in his opinion mental
activity is thought even if it does not lead to a belief or an opinion.
[
56
]
He discussed the role that thought has played in
human history, describing it as being fundamental both in terms of its
contribution to the formation and success of complex societies. He cited its
impact, from a social and political perspective on, the Reformation, the
emergence of the modern era and the recognition of individual rights and
freedoms. He described how this led to the rise of contemporary constitutional
democracies which emphasize individual autonomy and the right to direct one’s
own life.
[
57
]
Professor Swaine defines “freedom of thought” as
the ability to engage in mental activity without interference by others. Interference
in the sense includes the actions of another party that result in hindering,
obstructing, impeding, reaching, or punishing mental activity. In terms of
state action that could lead to a violation of freedom of thought,
Professor Swaine
identified the following four
categories;
(i)
Investigation or Intrusion into one’s thoughts
(ii)
Modification or Manipulation of one’s thoughts
(iii)
Punishment for one’s thoughts
(iv)
Preventing thought
[
58
]
With respect to this latter category, Professor
Swaine acknowledged that some care must be given in determining when state action
should properly be viewed as thought prevention, given the many ways in which those
actions can indirectly impede one’s  thoughts process. He said that factors to
be considered would include the purpose of the prevention, and whether the
purpose could be pursued by less invasive means.
[
59
]
As indicated by Professor Swaine, freedom of
thought was seen by philosophers as both distinct from other freedoms such as
conscience, belief, opinion, expression, and religion and foundational to them.
He traced the “primacy” of freedom of thought to philosophers including John
Stuart Mill, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and John Rawls.
[
60
]
Professor Swaine points out that the primacy of
freedom of thought is reflected in its placement in relation to other rights in
the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which states
that:
Everyone has
the right to freedom of thought,
conscience
and
religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and
freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to
manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice,
worship
and observance.
[
61
]
Professor Swaine was consulted as part of the United
Nations General Assembly Interim Report on
Freedom of Religion or Belief
published in October 2021. The Report was the first attempt to correlate
international consensus on freedom of thought.
[
62
]
Professor Swaine said the Report underscores the
primacy of freedom of thought which it describes as one’s “f
orum internum.”
Professor
Swaine says this is consistent with John Stuart Mill’s “
inward domain of
consciousness.”
[
63
]
The Report describes the attributes of freedom
of thought to include the freedom not to reveal one’s thoughts, the freedom
from punishment for one’s thoughts and protection from impermissible alteration
of thought. In this latter category, the Report discusses the ways in which
brain structures can be modified by the forcible administration of psychoactive
substances.
[
64
]
He acknowledged that the concept of freedom of
thought is underdeveloped in both law and philosophy and that there is no thorough
consensus among academics or scientists on the full scope of thought. He
acknowledged that the Report did not endorse thought prevention as a potential
violation of freedom of thought.
Professor David Nutt
[
65
]
Professor Nutt is an experienced psychiatrist
and professor of Neuropsycho­pharmacology at Imperial College in London
England. In his work as a psychopharmacologist, he has gained extensive
clinical and research experience on the effects of drugs on the brain. This
includes clinical research related specifically to psilocybin. He has published
extensively on the effects of drugs on the brain. This includes several books,
including most recently a book on the clinical use of psychedelics in
psychiatry. He has more than 20 years experience as a member of the United Kingdom
government Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), including eight
years as the Chair of its Technical Committee.
[
66
]
On consent, he was qualified to give expert
evidence on the effects of psilocybin, the safety of psilocybin and the safety
of psilocybin relative to the safety of other recreational drugs.
[
67
]
According to Professor Nutt, psilocybin is a
non-addictive non-toxic substance with a low potential for harm. He said
numerous peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials demonstrate psilocybin’s
safety and efficacy – that it has shown promising therapeutic potential in the treating
conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction and that it
promotes cognitive flexibility, emotional openness, spiritual insight, ego
dissolution and enhanced connectedness to family and others.
[
68
]
Professor
Nutt
cited
five
studies
[4]
involving a total of 160 patients in support of
his
opinion
that one can reasonably expect to experience the following effects during or
after their psilocybin experience: cognitive flexibility (a study involving 20
patients with treatment resistant depression), spirituality (a study of 36
patients, life meaning (14 patients, 7 of whom had treatment resistant
depression), connectivity with self, others and nature and ego dissolution. All
the studies cited explicitly recognize the limits of extrapolating their
findings.
[
69
]
With respect to cognitive flexibility, he said
psilocybin was associated with an improved ability to engage with and alter thinking
processes, particularly in relation to determinate depressive ruminations. He
cited brain imaging studies that reveal the brain is more flexible after
psilocybin treatment.
[
70
]
He said these effects persist for up to a month after
psychedelic dosing.
[5]
[
71
]
He described how psilocybin stimulates the 5-HT2A
receptors which are most dense in that part of the brain where
abstract and creative thinking, imaging and self reflection take place. He said
this stimulation leads to less synchronized brain activity which in turn interrupts
established ways of thinking and allows people to think in more creative and
diverse ways. He cited this as an explanation for the
different
levels
of consciousness, hallucinations, out of body experiences and
personal insights that occur during the psychedelic state.
[
72
]
With respect to risks, he testified that the
risks associated with psilocybin use is greater for people who have had past
mental health issues. He said this was particularly the case with those
suffering from psychosis or those with a close (first-degree) family relative
with psychosis. He said there was limited studies on the effects of psilocybin
on pregnant women and that he would not recommend that they use psilocybin.
[
73
]
Professor Nutt emphasized that the psychedelic
state itself is unpredictable, and that “in theory” it can lead to self-harm or
accidental harm as a result of misinterpreting risks associated with a
particular behaviour or action. He said that anxiety, both before and during psychedelic
dosing, is a major predictor of poor negative outcomes from psilocybin
treatment. However, he said these risks are very low when the following best
practices are applied:
(i)
conduct medical screening prior to the use of
psilocybin by a doctor or dispensing pharmacist;
(ii)
provide good education and
preparation;
(iii)
taking psilocybin in a controlled environment in the presence of a therapist
or a responsible adult who is not under the influence of
psilocybin;
(iv)
providing lower doses to those at higher risk of panic attacks or
those with a history of other anxiety disorders; and
(v)
avoiding the use of alcohol or other stimulant drugs as this has also
been reported to result in adverse effects.
[
74
]
Overall, he said psilocybin ranks extremely low
in terms of harm when compared to other recreation drugs and far less harmful
than alcohol.
[
75
]
Given his evidence on the relative safety of
psilocybin, Professor Nutt criticized current drug laws as arbitrary and not evidence
based. He advocated for the legal access to psilocybin under a regulated harm
reduction framework with key safety measures which would exclude vulnerable
populations (e.g., those with psychosis) and include supervised or guided use
(especially for first-time users), together with education and close controls. He
stated, “…given the remarkable safety of psilocybin … It seems to me
inexcusable that it should be denied to people who might want it.”
[6]
[
76
]
He proposed a licensed access model like that in
the Netherlands
where  individuals
could obtain
psilocybin with a medical certificate of approval, with screening to exclude
people with psychosis or taking contraindicated medications and where a smart
card system could limit the number of doses per year. He also endorsed Oregon’s
legal psilocybin model which provides guided psilocybin experiences in a
controlled and therapeutic environment. He did not endorse unrestricted
recreational  legalization
.
Professor Zachary Walsh
[
77
]
Professor Walsh has worked as a clinical
psychologist for the past 16 years and is a professor in the Department of
Psychology at the University of British Columbia. He has extensive research
experience in the use and effects of psychedelic drugs and psilocybin in
particular. At the time of giving his evidence, he was the principal
investigator of the largest study to date on the microdosing of psychedelics – primarily
psilocybin. He has previous clinical experience in psilocybin-assisted
psychotherapy through Health Canada’s Special Access Program and has published
several scientific articles on the use of psilocybin and mental health.
[
78
]
On consent, Professor Walsh was qualified
to provide expert evidence on the use, effects, and access to psilocybin,
including its prevalence in Canada, the risks associated with psilocybin use
and the motivations underlying its consumption.
He was also qualified to give expert evidence on the health and
safety risks associated with the consumption of psilocybin when consumed under
circumstances similar to the protocols established for clinical trials or the
Special Access Program approved by Health Canada.
[
79
]
Professor Walsh testified that psilocybin is the most widely used
serotonergic psychedelic in North America, citing its accessibility, ease of
cultivation, and relatively shorter duration of effect compared to other
psychedelics such as LSD.
[
80
]
He referenced multiple peer-reviewed studies, including Griffiths
et al. (2011, 2008), Smigielski et al. (2019), and Lake & Lucas (2024),
which collectively demonstrate that psilocybin reliably induces mystical-type
experiences. He says
these altered thought
experiences
are characterized by ego dissolution, a sense of unity or transcendence, and
are frequently described by participants as among the most meaningful of their
lives. Professor Walsh noted that such experiences are associated with
increased well-being, personal growth, and spiritual insight.
[
81
]
Three of the four studies cited in support of
his opinion involves a total of hundred and 117 participants. The authors of
one study involving 60 healthy participants concluded the following: “results
of our study suggest that psychedelics do not enhance creative thinking per se,
but rather mediate changes in particulars constructs of creative thinking, in a
time-dependent manner.” The fourth study was survey-based involving 740 adult
users of psychedelics, 80% of whom used psilocybin.
[
82
]
In terms of safety, Professor Walsh opined that psilocybin
presents a low risk profile when consumed in controlled settings. He
acknowledged that adverse effects may include temporary increases in blood
pressure, gastrointestinal discomfort, headaches, and, in some cases, anxiety
or disorientation. He emphasized that these risks are generally manageable and
significantly reduced when psilocybin is administered in accordance with
established protocols, such as those used in clinical trials or in Oregon’s
regulated psilocybin framework. He further testified that challenging
psychological experiences, while possible, are often therapeutically beneficial
when properly supported.
[
83
]
Professor Walsh reviewed the Oregon model for psilocybin access,
which includes mandatory screening, preparation sessions, supervised
administration by certified facilitators, and optional integration sessions. He
endorsed these procedures as reflective of best practices and consistent with
those employed in Health Canada’s Special Access Program. He noted that
individuals with active psychosis, a history of self-harm, or contraindicated
medications (e.g., lithium) are excluded from participation under these models
given the increased risk. He noted that these trials as well
as the SAP only involve patients with mental and physical health problems and
that this speaks positively to the anticipated risk associated with consumption
for non-medical, thought-related purposes.
[
84
]
He explained that the primary objective of
screening procedures is to mitigate risk by excluding individuals with severe
mental illness, given that the psychedelic experience induced by psilocybin can
be profoundly intense and disorienting. It was further noted that the use of a
controlled setting serves to reduce the likelihood of accidents (e.g. falls)
arising from such disorientation, and the presence of a licensed facilitator
further diminishes the risk of adverse and potentially harmful acute reactions.
Finally, he emphasized the importance of post-treatment reintegration sessions
with a trained specialist, aimed at addressing any subsequent concerns and the
monitoring of any unexpected negative outcomes.
[
85
]
With respect to prevalence, Professor Walsh cited recent national
survey data indicating that approximately two million Canadians reported
psychedelic use in the past year, with psilocybin being the most commonly used
substance. He accepted the reliability of this data and acknowledged that
motivations for use include personal growth, general well-being, and
recreation. He testified that psilocybin is not typically associated with
compulsive use or substance use disorders, and that its pharmacological profile
does not engage the dopaminergic reward system in the same manner as substances
such as alcohol or stimulants.
[
86
]
Professor Walsh concluded that while psilocybin is not without
risk, those risks are relatively low and comparable to or lower than those
associated with legal substances such as alcohol.
Crown Expert
Dr. Joshua Rosenblat
[
87
]
Dr. Rosenblat is a practising psychiatrist
at Toronto Western Hospital
with specialized training in
psychopharmacology.
In
addition to providing direct clinical care to patients
who are suffering from psychiatric illnesses, he conducts research and has
authored numerous scientific articles on the use of psychedelics, including
psilocybin. He was involved in seven psilocybin clinical trials, having led
Canada’s first investigator-initiated
psilocybin
clinical trial. He has experience in
writing clinical trial protocols for the administration of psilocybin and has
established a training program for mental health providers and physicians to
learn how to safely support individuals undergoing psilocybin treatment.
[
88
]
On consent, Dr. Joshua Rosenblat was qualified to
give expert evidence
on the
nature, pharmacology, and toxicology of psilocybin, psilocin, and other
psychedelic drugs, including the use, consumption, effects, and factors
influencing the incidence and severity of effects of those drugs.
[
89
]
He indicated that psilocybin
is a “classic psychedelic” that induces a non-ordinary state of consciousness
(NOSC), typically commencing 15–45 minutes after ingestion and lasting 4–8
hours. The effects vary significantly depending on the dose administered, the
individual’s neurochemistry and psychological state and environmental context,
including the physical setting and preparatory support.
[
90
]
Dr. Rosenblat
emphasized that psilocybin’s effects are inherently unpredictable. Even with
identical doses and settings, the same individual may experience different
effects across sessions. He confirmed that mystical and spiritual experiences
are common and may correlate with positive long-term outcomes, though not
universally.
He indicated that n
o specific outcome, whether mystical
experience or adverse reaction, are guaranteed to occur.
[
91
]
Dr. Rosenblat
categorized psilocybin’s effects into acute, subacute, and long-term.
[
92
]
He described the acute effects which last up to
eight hours post ingestion to include the following:
(i)
cognitive effects: cognitive flexibility/creativity,
disorganization, disorientation,
distractibility;
(ii)
perceptual effects: hallucinations, derealization, depersonalization,
time/space
distortion;
(iii)
emotional effects: anxiety, paranoia, modal ability,
agitation;
(iv)
physical effects: increased blood pressure, nausea, headaches; and
(v)
rare but serious effects: seizures, attempts to leave the session,
harm to self or others (including suicidality and homicidality).
[
93
]
He described the subacute effects which last
from days to weeks post ingestion to include the following:
(i)
An “afterglow” period marked by increased
openness, wellbeing, and cognitive flexibility; and
(ii)
Common side effects which
include insomnia, appetite changes, headaches, and lingering nausea.
[
94
]
He indicated that the long-term effects were
less well understood due to limited follow-up data and selection bias but said
the potential risks included Hallucinogen Use Disorder (i.e. addiction) and Hallucinogen
Persisting Perception Disorder (
H.P.P.D.
) involving distressing
flashbacks. He said the long-term effects had not been observed in clinical
trials to date but have been reported in recreational users.
[
95
]
His description of the
acute effects mentioned above included the following:
(i)
Cognitive Flexibility: increased ability to change
one’s perceptions. He gave an example of how this would permit one to change
one’s perception of oneself from “I’m a bad person” to “
I’m 
good
person.” He described how this could lead to a change in behaviour and
increased social interactions. He agreed that these effects have been seen in
the one-month follow-up,” and that there are some long-term studies that
suggest that cognitive flexibility may persist past that point. He said that
psilocybin temporarily
increases
neuroplasticity,
the
ability
of
the
brain
to
rewire
itself.
He indicated that
“
the
theory
is
that
if
you
have
a
therapist
there
to
help
you
rewire
it,
in
a
positive
adaptive
way,
probably
really
helpful
versus
if
there’s
someone
there
who
pushes
you
in
the
direction
of
maybe
new
thought
patterns but
equally
negative
and
unhelpful
thought
patterns.” He said this could lead to thinking in a different way i.e.,
in a more meaningful, logical way
.
(ii)
Disorganization: “…in an ordinary state
of
consciousness
we
typically
have
linear
thought
patterns,
we
think
after
we
finish
court,
we’ll
go
have
some
lunch
and
then
we’ll
come
back
to
court,
that’s
sort
of
the
linear
progression,
whereas
disorganization
would
be
scattered
all
over
the
place,
thinking
about
last
week,
thinking
about
two
weeks
from
now
and really not having a clear linearity
to your thought pattern…”
(iii)
Disorientation: “Disorientation
is
specific
to
knowing
where
you
are. So,
disorientation
would
be
when
we
ask
people,
‘Do
you
know
where
you
are?’
‘Do
you
know
what
date
it
is?’
and
they
can’t
answer
those
questions,
they’re
disoriented,
they
don’t
know
where
they
are
or
what
the
date
is.
Sometimes
in
extreme
situations, they wouldn’t even know what their name is.”
(iv)
Distractibility: “Distractibility,
that
one
I
think
is
probably
more
easy
to
understand
just
in
terms
of
being
distracted, and
if
you’re
trying
to
have
a
conversation,
they
might
be
distracted
by
something
on
the
wall
or
something
behind
them,
and
they
really can’t maintain their focus on one person or one topic.”
(v)
Hallucinations: “…seeing
or hearing things that aren’t there…”
(vi)
Derealization: “Derealization is a
symptom of dissociation where
things
feel
like
they’re
not
real.
It
can
also
be
quite
distressing
where
you
feel
like
the
person
in
front
of
you
is
fake,
is
not
a
real
person,
the
furniture
in
the
room
is
not
real,
sometimes
feeling that
they’re
personally
not
real,
so just this general sense that things
are not real.”
(vii)
Depersonalization: “Depersonalization
would be in the same bucket of
dissociation,
but
depersonalization
is
more
so
relating
to
being
disconnected
from
oneself.
So,
that
would
be
more
like
your
out-of-body
experience
where
you
feel
like
you’ve
been
removed
from
your
body
and
sometimes,
you’re
looking
down
at
yourself, that’s depersonalization.”
(viii)
Time distortions: “…with time distortion sometimes people
feel like
things
are
moving
very
slowly
or
they
feel
like
things
are
moving
very
quickly.
It
would
be
very
common
that
patients
will
say
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
day
“
I
have
no
idea
how
long
I’ve
been
in
this
room
for”
because
they
lose
track
of
time;
(ix)
Space distortions
:  “
Space
distortion
as
well
in
terms
of
sometimes
it
looking
like
there’s
more
room.
So,
you
know,
sometimes
people
tripping
and
falling
because
they
think
that
there’s
more
space
between
them
and
something
in
front
of
them,
so
just
sort
of
a
distortion
of the space between them and other
objects around them.”
[
96
]
Dr. Rosenblat testified as to his direct experience in
administering approximately 120 doses of psilocybin to 70 patients within
regulated clinical trials. He described the rigorous
safeguards employed in clinical trials which are subject to Health Canada
approval, Research Ethics Board review, and s. 56 exemptions under the
Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act
which permit him to both
possess and
administer
psilocybin.
[
97
]
Participants are
screened to exclude those with
psychiatric or medical
risk factors
. Sessions occur in custom-designed rooms with two trained
therapists present and real-time monitoring. Rescue medications such as Gravol
and Lorazepam are available for emergent symptoms. He said Serious Adverse
Events (SAEs) are rare but require immediate reporting and intervention. Despite
this, he noted that incidents requiring rescue interventions, either pharmacological
or therapeutic, are common, even if SAEs are not.
[
98
]
While acknowledging the
growing body of research, Dr. Rosenblat emphasized the limitations of existing clinical
research data. In his opinion, the long-term effects of psilocybin treatment are
still poorly understood. He attributed this to the lack of patient follow up. He
cited a lack of research funding required to conduct long term follow-up as
well as the declining retention rate of patients following their session.
[
99
]
He discussed the use of
survey-based studies but said they are considered lower quality than randomized
controlled trials.
[
100
]
Nonetheless,
he said there was general consensus regarding the key risk factors associated
with psilocybin which include
patient
factors (e.g., psychiatric history, age), drug factors (e.g., dose, purity,
frequency) and environmental factors (e.g., setting, support).
[
101
]
He indicated that psilocybin is not
currently approved as a medicine in Canada and that no phase III clinical trials
have been completed. He said that two positive phase III randomized control
trials demonstrating safety and efficacy are required for FDA or Health Canada
approval. He indicated that two such trials are ongoing but have not yet been
completed. If successful, he estimated that psilocybin may be approved for
medical use in approximately 5 years.
[
102
]
Dr.
Rosenblat also addressed the broader context of psychedelic use, referencing
survey data (Evans et al.) indicating that while some individuals report
extended difficulties following psychedelic use, a majority ultimately view
their experiences as beneficial. He cautioned, however, that continued use may
reflect dependency rather than therapeutic gain
and emphasized the need for continued research to
determine whether the benefits outweigh the harms.
Health Canada Witnesses
Ian MacKay
[
103
]
Mr. MacKay manages the
Special Access Program
(
SAP
) for
Health Canada which is responsible for granting exemptions for the use of
controlled substances, including psilocybin, for medical purposes.
[
104
]
Mr.
MacKay testified that the
SAP
is designed to facilitate access to
unapproved drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions, upon
request by a licensed healthcare practitioner. The program operates under the
Food and Drug Regulations and is not intended to provide access for
recreational, philosophical, or non-clinical purposes.
[
105
]
As
of October 2024,
SAP
had authorized 245 requests for psilocybin, with
approximately 50 additional authorizations granted between October and February
2025. The lead indication for these requests was Major Depressive Disorder. Mr.
MacKay confirmed that
SAP
does not currently recognize PTSD as a lead
indication for psilocybin, although MDMA is considered appropriate for that
condition.
[
106
]
He
further testified that one Open Label Individual Patient (OLIP) trial involving
psilocybin was also approved. No requests have been received for access to psilocybin
based on freedom of thought, spiritual exploration, or personal development.
Mr. MacKay emphasized that all SAP decisions are grounded in clinical evidence
and therapeutic need.
[
107
]
Importantly,
Mr. MacKay’s testimony confirmed that the SAP does not provide a pathway for
individuals seeking psilocybin for non-clinical purposes, including those grounded in freedom of thought or spiritual inquiry.
Dr. Jennifer Pelley
[
108
]
Dr. Pelley oversees the development and implementation of policies
and regulations under the
CDSA
in her role as the Director of the Office
of Regulatory Affairs within Health Canada’s
Controlled Substances
and Overdose Response Directorate.
[
109
]
Dr.
Pelley explained that psilocybin is classified as a Schedule III controlled
substance under the
CDSA
and as a restricted drug under Part J of the
Food
and Drug Regulations
. She confirmed that Canada is a party to the 1971 UN
Convention
on Psychotropic Substances
, which governs international control of
psilocybin.
[
110
]
She
outlined three legal pathways for access:
(i)
Clinical trials under the
Food and Drug Act (FDA
)
;
(ii)
The Special Access Program (SAP): and
(iii)
Section 56(1) exemptions under the
CDSA
for medical, scientific,
or public interest purposes.
[
111
]
Dr.
Pelley emphasized that s. 56(1) cannot exempt individuals from prohibitions
under the
FDA
, including the sale of unapproved drugs.
[
112
]
At
paragraph 23 of her affidavit, Dr. Pelley stated that the purpose of the
CDSA
is “to protect public health and maintain public safety by balancing the need
for access to the substances scheduled under the CDSA and its regulations for
legitimate medical, scientific and industrial uses with the risks associated
with their misuse and their diversion to illegal markets.” She cited
Canada v. PHS Community Services
Society
,
[7]
in support of her position.
[
113
]
Upon
cross-examination, Dr. Pelley clarified that her articulation of the
CDSA
’s
purpose was based on internal Health Canada briefing materials and not directly
derived from the Supreme Court’s decision in
PHS
.
She acknowledged that the core purpose is dual: public health and public
safety.
[
114
]
In her affidavit she indicated that when
considering a s. 56 exemption, the availability of existing regulatory pathways
to conduct the activity is one of the factors and that generally, established
regulatory pathways should be explored before making a request for an
individual s. 56(1) exemption under the
CDSA
.
[
115
]
She
further testified that Health Canada has yet to receive a request for an
exemption to allow the use psilocybin for “freedom of thought” purposes and
that
they
do not maintain public guidance on how to
apply for such exemptions.
[
116
]
She spoke of 82 instances between 2020 and October of 2024 where
exemptions for psilocybin use were granted on compassionate grounds for end-of-life
treatment involving psychotherapy. In another example, she cited 19 healthcare
professionals who were granted access to psilocybin for their own personal use.
The exemptions were granted on the basis that their own experience with
psilocybin would place them in a better position to understand and support the patients
they were treating with psilocybin assisted therapy
.
[8]
[
117
]
She said that Health Canada does not provide any information on
what is required in order to obtain a personal exemption for psilocybin use. She
explained that apart from exemptions for medical or therapeutic purposes,
Health Canada is not in the business of promoting access to what is effectively
an illegal drug.
III.
FINDINGS OF FACT
[
118
]
Psilocybin is a
naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms,
often called “magic mushrooms.” It is listed as a Schedule III substance under
the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
, which prohibits its possession and
distribution  in the absence of an authorized exemption.
[
119
]
When taken in
sufficient quantity, psilocybin produces a psychedelic state or “trip” which
lasts from 4-8 hours. The purported thought related benefits are achieved as a
result of having experienced a psychedelic trip. The reported benefits include
cognitive flexibility, ego dissolution, spiritual insights and enhanced
connections with others and nature.
[
120
]
I accept the
evidence of the civilian witnesses. Each of them described the therapeutic
benefits they received from of the consumption of psilocybin. They described
experiencing profound emotional and spiritual insights, emotional healing, a newfound
sense of self-worth and a greater sense of connectedness to nature and those
around them.
[
121
]
None of them had
previously applied pursuant to
s. 56
of the
CDSA
for an exemption that
would allow them to possess and consume psilocybin on the basis that it
enhanced their thought process.
[
122
]
The
SAP
administered
by the Ministry of Health does not provide exemptions for nonclinical use of
psilocybin. The program exists only for the purpose of providing access to
patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.
[
123
]
Based on the
evidence of Dr. Pelley which I accept, I am satisfied that individuals seeking
access to psilocybin for any thought related benefits have no direct means of
doing so through a s. 56 exemption and that any such request would be denied.
[
124
]
More importantly,
her evidence satisfies me that the regulatory framework that would be necessary
for accessing psilocybin in a controlled environment, with appropriate
safeguards, does not exist.
[
125
]
On the evidence
of the three medical experts, I am satisfied that psilocybin can be safely
administered in a highly regulated and controlled environment. By “safely”, I
mean that the risk to self and others can be adequately reduced and that
protocols can be put in place to reduce access to individuals with known
psychiatric or medical risk factors.
This
is what is now occurring in clinical trials related to the safety and efficacy
of psilocybin for medical and therapeutic use.
[
126
]
I
find that the acute effects of a psychedelic dose of psilocybin, which can last
between four and eight hours, are as described by Dr. Rosenblatt – that in
addition to cognitive flexibility, the psychedelic state itself produces
disorganized nonlinear thought patterns, hallucinations, distortions as to time
and place, and depersonalization. I find that the effects a psychedelic dose of
psilocybin are inherently unpredictable in that no particular outcome can be expected
in any given case
.
[
127
]
I
am also satisfied on the evidence of both Professor Nutt and Dr. Rosenblat that
psilocybin increases neuroplasticity
and that with the
assistance of a therapist, would enable new thought patterns to develop.
Studies show these effects can be maintained for up to a month and there are
some long-term studies that suggest this benefit could extend beyond that
point.
[
128
]
I
also find that although the results of clinical trials conducted thus far are promising
with respect to the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of certain mental
health conditions, those results are preliminary. As indicated by Dr. Rosenblat,
several clinical trials are ongoing which, if successful, could lead to the approval
of psilocybin for medicinal purposes in approximately five years.
[
129
]
I find that the long-term effects of psilocybin use are still not
fully understood.

V.
STANDING
Section 5(2)
[
130
]
The applicant has standing to challenge
s. 5
of the
CDSA
even
though he does not personally claim to use psilocybin for thought
related purposes or otherwise. Our law provides that an
accused may challenge the constitutionality of a law
under which he is charged by pointing to the unconstitutional effects it has on
third parties.
[9]
To this extent, anyone subject to a criminal prosecution has the right to
challenge the constitutionality of an offence with which they are charged.
Section 4(1)
[
131
]
As indicated
above, the applicant submits that the prohibition on trafficking in psilocybin
unreasonably interferes with the s. 2(b) and 7 rights of others who would seek
to benefit from accessing it for thought related purposes. Relying on a number
of decisions including the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in
Hitzig v
Canada
,
[10]
he submits that, “The right to access a substance must include a means of
access.”
[11]
In short, the applicant submits that there is a constitutional right to access
psilocybin for thought related purposes and that this right is illusory unless
the prohibition on trafficking is ruled unconstitutional.
[
132
]
As part of his
argument, the applicant proposes that psilocybin could safely be made available
for those wishing to access it for thought related purposes in a supervised and
regulated clinical setting similar to the ones now operating in the State of
Oregon.
[
133
]
Based on the
implied assumption that access necessarily involves possession, the Crown
submits that this amounts to a collateral attack
s. 4(1)
of the
CDSA
.
The Crown points to the fact that the applicant has not included
s. 4(1)
in his
NCQ
or in his plea for relief
and therefore he has no standing to directly challenge it.
[
134
]
The Crown
submits that an indirect attack on
s. 4(1)
cannot succeed on its merits given
that the law does not recognize a right to possess a controlled substance other
than for medical purposes or a right to trafficking generally.
[
135
]
Despite this,
the applicant maintained in oral submissions that he was not seeking a ruling
on the constitutionality of
s. 4(1)
of the
CDSA
but argued that if
psilocybin is a freedom of thought tool protected by the
Charter
,
then
laws which restrict
access
to it by third parties are also
unconstitutional.
[
136
]
I find that in
the absence of formal Notice and a ruling on standing to challenge
s. 4(1)
of
the
CDSA
, the applicant cannot challenge the constitutionality of
s.
5(2)
,
by pointing to its unconstitutional effect on the right of
others
to possess
psilocybin for thought related purposes.
[
137
]
In my view, the
issue is not whether an indirect attack can succeed on the merits. It rests on
the principle that one is not permitted to do indirectly (e.g., challenge the
constitutionality of an uncharged offence) that which cannot be done directly
(e.g., proceeding with that challenge without filing Notice).
Such an approach has
consistently been rejected by our courts.
[12]
[
138
]
The wording of
s.
109
of the
CJA
is such that absent proper notice, I lack the authority
to rule on the constitutionality of
s. 4
of the
CDSA
. As indicated by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in
R v. Briggs
[13]
,
“
In the absence
of the constitutionality of the legislation being raised in the appropriate
manner, this Court has no authority to do so. A party intending to challenge
the constitutional validity of legislation is required to provide notice of a
constitutional question to the Attorneys General of the Province and Canada. In
the absence of such notice, the Court is barred from considering the issue.”
[
139
]
As previously
stated, accused persons always have the right to challenge the
constitutionality of an offence under which they are charged.
[
140
]
Different
considerations apply where the accused seeks to challenge the constitutionality
of a provision other than the one with which they are charged. In such cases,
in addition to filing Notice under the
Courts of Justice Act
, the
accused must meet the requirements for either “private interest” and/or “public
interest” standing with respect to the uncharged offence. The case of
R v.
Mernagh
[14]
is a prime example.
[
141
]
Private interest
standing requires evidence that the accused has a direct personal interest in
the provision in question
beyond that of a member of the
general public.
The interest must
be “real and not speculative.”
[15]
[
142
]
“Public
interest” standing to challenge the constitutionality of a provision other than
the one charged will be satisfied where an accused can establish:
(i)
that there is a serious issue raised as to the validity of the
legislation;
(ii)
that he is directly affected by the impugned provision or has a genuine
interest in its validity; and
(iii)
that there is no other reasonable and effective way this issue could be
brought before the court.
[16]
[
143
]
In my view, it
is unlikely that the applicant would be granted standing to challenge
s. 4
of
the
CDSA
on the
basis of someone else’s right to
possess
psilocybin,
even if
was been
included in the
applicant’s
Notice
.
[17]
While this may explain why
the applicant decided not to directly challenge
s. 4(1)
, I am not satisfied
that the present state of the law grants him another means by which to generate
what would in effect be a ruling on that issue.
[
144
]
In my view, in
the absence of proper notice, the case law confirms the ability to challenge a
charged offense based on its effect on third parties but does not support the
ability to do so where the constitutionality of the charged offence rests on
the constitutionality of an uncharged offence for which the third party would
be liable to prosecution.
[18]
[
145
]
If an indirect attack
were permitted in these circumstances, it would effectively do away with the
standing requirements with respect to uncharged offences – requirements that
were designed to promote the efficient use of court resource by weeding
frivolous or hypothetical disputes. Anyone would be able to challenge the
constitutionality of a charged offence based on its effect on third parties to
commit other offences with which the accused is not charged.
[
146
]
It would also potentially
result
in considerable confusion in the
law. In the absence of a direct challenge to the prohibition on possession, a finding
that
s. 5(2)
is unconstitutional because it deprives others of a
constitutionally protected right to
possess
psilocybin for thought
related purposes would invariably lead the public to believe that they have a
right to possess psilocybin when
s. 4(1)
of the
CDSA
states otherwise.
[
147
]
The question
remains as to whether there is any other basis upon which the applicant can
challenge the constitutionality of s. 5 without relying on the ability of
others to possess psilocybin for thought related purposes. This, I find, is
what this case is about and why the applicant has consistently referenced the
ability of others to “access” as opposed to “possess” psilocybin when referring
to the unconstitutional effect that
s. 5
of the
CDSA
has on others. Although
not specifically stated, the key lies in the difference between possessing a
controlled substance and having it administering.
[
148
]
I begin by
noting that the
CDSA
defines “traffic” to include the following: “to
sell,
administer
, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver a substance
”.
[19]
[
149
]
The
CDSA
incorporates the definition of “possession” contained in the
Criminal Code
.
[20]
The
Criminal Code
defines possession to include both knowledge of, and
control over, the item being possessed.
[
150
]
With these
definitions in mind, a controlled substance can be trafficked to someone by
administering it to them in circumstances where the person to whom the
substance is administered does not have legal possession i.e., control over the
substance. This routinely occurs when one receives a vaccine. We “access” the
vaccine by having it administered to us in circumstances where we do not
possess it in any meaningful sense. Likewise, when a patient receives and
injection of a of morphine for pain relief, the patient does not have control
of the morphine in any real sense. This happens in our hospitals on a daily basis
without the need for the patient to obtain a s. 56 exemption.
[
151
]
As indicated by
Dr. Rosenblat, in clinical trials, he obtains a s. 56 exemption to both
possess
and
administer
the psilocybin. The fact that he gets an exemption for “administering”
and not “giving” or “transferring” is indicative of the fact that the patient
is not expected to be in actual possession of the psilocybin.
[
152
]
This would
potentially be the case in the clinic model advocated by the applicant where
individuals could
access
psilocybin in a highly regulated and controlled
environment by having it administered to them in pill form by a trained and licensed
facilitator and without being in legal possession or control of it. This would
mirror what occurs in clinical trials were psilocybin is administered in a
controlled environment with significant safeguards.
[
153
]
In this sense,
the applicant is effectively proposing a form of access which would preserve
the prohibition on general possession of psilocybin under
s. 4(1)
of the
CDSA
.
This would be entirely consistent with the applicant’s position that he is not
challenging the constitutionality of
s. 4
of the
CDSA
. It would also be consistent
with the views expressed by the Professor Nutt and Professor Walsh, neither of
whom endorsed the general possession and use of psilocybin outside of a
regulated and controlled environment with appropriate safeguards.
[
154
]
Therefore, given
that he has not filed Notice to challenge
s. 4(1)
, I find that while the
applicant can challenge
s. 5
of the
CDSA
based on the right of others to
access
psilocybin, he cannot do so based on their right to
possess
it.
[
155
]
It is on this
basis that I will consider the following constitutional challenge in this case:
1.
Does
prohibiting the administration of psilocybin for personal use by others under
s.5
of the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
, by reason of the inclusion of this
substance in Schedule III to the Act, infringe
ss. 2(b)
and
7
of the
Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
?
2.
If
the answer to question one is in the affirmative, is the infringement justified
under
s.1
of the
Charter
.
VI.
CHARTER INTERPRETATION – SECTION 2(B)
[
156
]
Freedom of thought
occupies
a foundational place in the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
,
appearing first among the fundamental freedoms enumerated in
s. 2(b)
. Yet,
despite its prominence, the concept remains largely unexplored by our courts.
[
157
]
Since the enactment of the
Charter
,
lower courts have delineated the types of activities that infringe
upon thought without providing a detailed interpretation of its scope. The
activities in question primarily related to expressible content:
(i)
prohibiting
possession
of
marijuana
does
not
limit
freedom
of
thought
because the effect that marijuana has on the individual’s thought processes
“does not attract a free-standing constitutional right
”;
[21]
(ii)
requiring a person who was found guilty of the crime, but who believes
they are innocent, to admit their guilt limits their freedom of
thought;
[22]
(iii)
mandatory antiterrorism deprogramming imposes belief systems upon the
subject and thus limit freedom of thought and
expression;
[23]
(iv)
prohibiting business on Remembrance Day does not limit freedom of
thought because its purpose is not to compel remembrance or agreement with the
associated
ideals;
[24]
(v)
seatbelt laws do not limit freedom of thought, because freedom of
thought does not entail a freedom to impact on one’s own
thoughts;
[25]
(vi)
as a physician made conditional on certain research opinions and on
participation in psychotherapy does not limit freedom of
thought,
or
alternatively is a proportionate limit.
[26]
[
158
]
In
R
v.
Sharpe
[27]
,
the Supreme Court of Canada described freedom of thought as
falling on a continuum of “intellectual and expressive freedom” but did not
articulate a comprehensive framework for its scope, content, or limits:
The right conferred by
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
embraces a continuum
of intellectual and expressive freedom –  “freedom of thought, belief, opinion
and expression”.
The right to
possess
expressive material is integrally related to the development of thought,
belief,
opinion
and expression. The possession of
such material allows us to understand the thought of others or
consolidate
our own thought. Without the right to
possess
expressive material, freedom of thought,
belief,
opinion
and expression would
be compromised
. Thus the possession of expressive
materials falls within the continuum of rights protected by s. 2(b) of the
Charter
.
The private nature of the proscribed material may heighten the
seriousness of a limit on free expression. … It engages the fundamental right
to freedom of thought.
[28]
[
159
]
Accordingly, this Court must turn
to the general principles of
Charter
interpretation for assistance.
Position of the Parties
[
160
]
The applicant submits that freedom
of thought in
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
should be interpreted to protect
all mental activity
including the process by which
thought occurs. He submits that the court should define thought to include feelings
as well as “reasoning, reflecting, imagining, cogitating, remembering, wishing,
questioning, desiring, believing, deliberating, and other activities of the
mind.” The applicant submits that this “large and liberal interpretation”
[29]
is required to give full
effect to its purpose.
[
161
]
The applicant submits that psilocybin is a tool
that enhances the thought process and that
s. 5
of the
CDSA
infringes
upon freedom of thought to the extent that it prohibits access to this tool.
[
162
]
The Crown submits that
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
should
not be taken to include all mental
activity and must be interpreted in relation to the other freedoms enumerated
in
s. 2(b)
, which focus on expressible content. The Crown further submits that
freedom of thought is meant to protect against state intrusion into,
manipulation of, or punishment for thoughts and that it does not create an entitlement
to enhance or alter one’s thoughts with psychoactive drugs.
[
163
]
The Crown argues that if the
applicant’s proposed approach were accepted, the logic underlying it would
extend far beyond controlled substances – that any state action that limited
access to anything that affected mental activity would constitute an
infringement of freedom of thought. The Crown says this cannot be the law.
[
164
]
The Crown proposes that freedom of thought be
interpreted as protecting  the kind of ideas,  and the processes of developing
and arranging those ideas, that can generate beliefs, opinions, and other
expressible content
.
The Crown submits that this
would exclude pre-intellectual experiences like feelings. The Crown submits
that this is in keeping with the decision in
R v. Sharpe
[30]
given that the purpose identified by the Supreme Court with respect
to freedom of expression focused on the protection of a conveyance of
meaning
.
[
165
]
The Crown then points to the three-part
test for identifying breaches of expression developed by
the Supreme
Court of Canada
Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General
)
[31]
and
proposes a similar test adapted to freedom of thought
.
The Crown submits
that the prohibition in
s. 5(2)
fails under this test.
Principles of Charter Interpretation
[
166
]
Discerning the meaning of the
Charter
right requires the
court to go beyond the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation. As indicated
in
Hunter v. Southham Inc
.:
A statute defines present
rights and obligations. It is easily enacted and as easily repealed. A
constitution, by contrast, is drafted with an eye to the future. Its function
is to provide a continuing framework for the legitimate exercise of
governmental power and, when joined by a
Bill
or a
Charter of Rights
,
for
the unremitting protection of individual rights and liberties. Once enacted,
its provisions cannot easily be repealed or amended. It must, therefore, be
capable of growth and development over time to meet new social,
political
and historical realities often unimagined by
its framers. The judiciary is the guardian of the constitution and must, in
interpreting its provisions, bear these considerations in mind. Professor Paul
Freund expressed this idea aptly when he admonished the American courts “not to
read the provisions of the Constitution like a last will and testament lest it
become one.”
[32]
[
167
]
In
Big
M
Drug
Mart
,
the Supreme Court of Canada provided the
following guidance on understanding the purpose of the
Charter
right:
“…the
purpose
of
the
right
or
freedom
in
question
is
to
be
sought
by
reference
to the character and the larger objects of the
Charter
itself,
to the language chosen to articulate
the
specific
right
or
freedom,
to
the
historical
origins
of
the
concepts enshrined,
and
where
applicable,
to
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
other
specific rights
and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the
Charter
.”
[33]
[
168
]
The
starting
point
is
the
text
of the
Charter
right
.
[34]
The court must
consider
the
language used, other
Charter
rights with which
the
right
is
associated,
and
the
need
for
Charter
rights
to
be
capable
of
development
over
time.
[
169
]
However, as indicated
by the
Supreme
Court
of
Canada in
R v.
Poulin,
caution
is required to avoid conflating generosity and purposiveness:
As
was
reiterated
in
Grant
,
“[the]
purpose
of
a
right
must
always
be
the
dominant
concern
in
its
interpretation;
generosity
of
interpretation
is
subordinate
to
and
constrained
by
that
purpose”
(para.
17).
This
is
because
an
overly
generous
reading of a right risks protecting
“behaviour
that is outside the purpose and unworthy of
constitutional
protection”
(Hogg,
at
p.
36-30).
Indeed,
“[in]
the
case
of
most
rights...the
widest
possible
reading
of
the
right,
which
is
the
most
generous interpretation, will ‘overshoot’
the
purpose
of the right.”
[35]
[Emphasis added].
[36]
Textual Analysis
[
170
]
In the case of
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
,
freedom of thought
is listed with freedom of “
belief, opinion and expression including freedom
of the press and other media of communication.”
It was not listed alongside
“conscience and religion” as it was in both the
United
Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UNHDR)
[37]
and the
International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR)
.
[38]
This gives rise to two principles.
[
171
]
The presumption against tautology provides that “[every] word in
a statute is presumed to make sense and to have a specific role to play in
advancing the legislative purpose.”
[39]
[
172
]
The meaning of words is also
affected by the words to which it is linked in a sentence.
[40]
[
173
]
Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that freedom of thought
is related to but different from opinion, belief, and expression.
[
174
]
From the order in which the words appear, it is also reasonable
to conclude that thought is primary in the continuum of rights to the extent
that thoughts can lead to beliefs which in turn can lead to opinions which can
then lead to expression. While opinions and forms of expression can influence
thought, thought is nevertheless primary to the extent that those opinions and
forms of expression arise from it.
[
175
]
This interrelationship between
thought and expression was reflected in the Interim Report of the
UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of
thought as follows:
“[thought] and expression are conceptually and
practically distinct, yet they engage in a perpetual feedback loop in which
expression is a vehicle for exchanging and developing thoughts, and thoughts
feed expression.”
[41]
[
176
]
This approach accords with the
textual analysis of freedom of thought set out above and is consistent with the
continuum of intellectual freedoms describe
in
Sharpe
.
[
177
]
Freedom of expression is said to
serve three purposes:
(i)
seeking and attending the truth is an inherently good activity;
(ii)
participation in social and political decision-making is to be fostered
and encouraged; and
(iii)
the diversity in forms of individual self-fulfillment in human
flourishing ought to be cultivated and then essentially tolerant, indeed
welcoming, environment not only for the sake of those who convene a meeting,
but also for the sake of those to whom it is conveyed.
[42]
Historical Context
[
178
]
Freedom of thought does not appear
in the Canadian Bill of Rights or analogous provincial laws. It originated in
international law where it was adopted into early drafts of the
Charter
.
Because of this, international law and commentary may illuminate the purpose of
the freedom.
[43]
[
179
]
In accordance with the principle
of conformity, the
Charter
is presumed to provide protection at least as
great as that afforded by similar provisions in international human rights
documents which Canada has ratified. The rule is subject to clear legislative
intent to the contrary
.
[44]
Non-binding sources such as commentary from international human rights bodies
and experts, while relevant, carry less weight and are only a persuasive value
in interpreting the
Charter
.
[45]
They play a supportive and confirming role in interpreting the
Charter
and tend to be used to support or confirm the court’s interpretation of the
Charter
arrived at by way of a purposive of analysis.
[46]
[
180
]
As indicated above, the grouping of rights in
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
differs from  Article 18 the
United Nations Declaration of Human Rights
(UNHDR)
and Article 18 of the
International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR)
where religion is coupled with belief (
UNHDR
)
and conscience and religion (
ICCPR
). Both have their origin in the need
to protect philosophical and religious belief from compulsion or restrain.
[47]
[
181
]
In an early
draft of the
Charter
, freedom of thought was moved, apparently at the
recommendation of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution of Canada in
1972, from grouping with conscience and religion, to grouping with belief and
opinion:
We would have preferred not to have freedom of thought
linked solely with freedom of conscience and religion, since it actually has
(and presumably is intended to have) a wider application, and as located it
might run afoul of the ejusdem generis (same genus) rule of interpretation. We
believe it should rather be linked with freedom of opinion and expression.
[48]
[
182
]
This history indicates
that “thought” in
s. 2
(b) was understood to protect the same kind
of
intellectual
content
as in the above-noted Articles but
with
a
broader
(i.e.
not
necessarily philosophical or religious) application.
Purposive Analysis
[
183
]
The common
purpose of the fundamental freedoms, generally, was first described in detail
in Big M, with a focus on
s. 2
(a):
“Freedom can primarily be characterized by the absence
of coercion or constraint. If a person is compelled by the state or the will of
another to a course of action or inaction which he would not otherwise have
chosen, he is not acting of his own volition and he cannot be said to be
truly free
. One of the major purposes of the
Charter
is to protect, within reason, from compulsion or restraint. Coercion includes
not only such blatant forms of compulsion as direct commands to act or refrain
from acting on pain of sanction, coercion includes indirect forms of control
which determine or limit alternative courses of conduct available to others.”
[49]
[
184
]
In
R v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd
.
,
The Supreme
Court of Canada found that
s. 2
Charter
freedoms protected against
compulsion or restraint whether “direct or indirect, intentional, or
unintentional, foreseeable, or unforeseeable, so long as the burden on freedom
is more than “trivial or insubstantial.”
[50]
[
185
]
There is significant debate among scholars about the meaning of
freedom of thought in international human rights law. A recent report from the
UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of thought described this lack of consensus as
follows:
What constitutes
“thought” not only lacks legal precision, but also scientific and philosophical
consensus. Neuroscientists generally agree that thoughts are created when
billions of neurons (nerve cells) in the brain - connected by trillions of
synapses - fired together. But the consensus ends there. Some neuroscientists
distinguish “thought” from other cognitive processes including emotions based
on the primary part of the brain engaged. Others emphasize the complex, highly
interrelated nature of anatomical aspects of the brain that support cognitive
functions, comparing efforts to “trace of thought from beginning to end” “to
asking where the forest begins.”
[51]
[
186
]
Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur’s report shows
consensus in international law and commentary on at least three possible
“attributes” of freedom of thought:
(i)
Freedom not to reveal one’ s thought through state intrusion or
surveillance of thinking;
(ii)
Freedom from punishment from one’s thoughts, real or inferred; and
(iii)
Protection from impermissible alteration of thoughts which includes
freedom from coercion (not including “applying moral or intellectual
persuasion”) and freedom from modification of thoughts (changing an
individual’s thoughts through direct alteration of brain chemistry or brain).
[
187
]
Although the
Special Rapporteur identifies a fourth
potential
concern similar to what
Professor Swaine identified as “preventing thought” namely, that the state is
obliged to foster an enabling environment for freedom of thought,  he notes
that “this is not a universal position and the parameters are limited.”
[52]
VII.
Analysis
Section 2(b)
of
the
Charter
[
188
]
Freedom of
thought falls within what
Sharpe
described as a “continuum of
intellectual and expressive freedom.”
[53]
It is primary and hence broader than opinion, belief, or expression because it
forms the basis for those other rights. Put another way, one can think without
forming an opinion or belief that is expressed or capable of being expressed,
but opinions, beliefs and expressions are themselves the products of thought.
This explains why freedom of thought is the first protected right in the
continuum of expressive freedoms.
[
189
]
The primacy of
freedom of thought underscores the need for a broad and liberal interpretation
of thought itself. Support for this can also be found in the fact that thought
was placed next to opinion, belief, and expression and not next to freedom of
conscience and religion where it had originally appeared in an earlier draft of
the
Charter
. This suggests an intention to avoid limiting the purpose of
freedom of thought to matters of conscience and religion.
[
190
]
However, defining
thought to include all mental activity would be overly broad. It would extend
freedom of thought beyond its intended purpose. It would amount to defining
freedom in isolation to the other related rights mention in
s. 2
(b).
[
191
]
Including
feelings or emotions as a protected interest under
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
risks calling into question the constitutionality of virtually all government
action. This could not have been the intended purpose for which the right was
enshrined. Such an approach would conflate generosity with purposiveness,
something which the Supreme Court of Canada in
Poulin
[54]
cautioned against.
[
192
]
The definition
of thought as mental activity also lacks the specificity required to make any thought-related
claims justiciable. It would risk extending protection to all external stimuli
or experiences that impact upon the mind including all psychotropic drugs
currently prohibited under the
CDSA
.
[
193
]
I agree with the
Crown that thought is best understood in relation to expression. In
Sharpe
,
the court described the values underlying freedom of expression to include, “
individual
self-fulfillment, finding the truth through the open exchange of ideas, and the
political discourse fundamental to democracy.”
[55]
The court defined expression as “activity or communication that conveys or
attempts to convey meaning.”
[
194
]
In keeping with
this focus on the conveyance of meaning as part of the continuum of
intellectual and expressive freedoms, I find that thought is best understood as
those ideas that are capable of conveying meaning. I find that purpose of freedom
of thought is to protect against the coercion and constraint of ideas related
to opinion, belief, and other expressible content.
[
195
]
The parties
agree that freedom of thought should be interpreted not only to protect
thoughts themselves but should include protecting the process by which thoughts
are formed. I agree.
[
196
]
While a process
is not itself a thought, the nature of thought is such that a breach of freedom
of thought is most often manifested in restrictions of other freedoms, notably
expression. Such was the case in
Sharpe
. This flows from the fact that
thoughts cannot be seen or known until they manifest themselves in another form.
To this extent, protecting only thoughts would not afford any greater
protection than that afforded for other rights.
[
197
]
Accordingly, I find that the purpose of freedom of
thought is the protection against the coercion and restraint of ideas,
including
the process by which those ideas are developed
, that are
capable of generating opinions, beliefs, and other expressible content.
[
198
]
In
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General)
,
[56]
the Supreme Court of Canada developed a three-part test to
determine when expressive activity is protected:
1.
Does
the activity in question have expressive content, thereby bringing it within
2(b) protection?;
2.
Does
the method or location of this expression remove that protection?; and
3.
If
the expression is protected by 2(b), does the government action in question
infringe that protection, either in purpose or effect?
[
199
]
Given its
relationship to expression, I adopt the same test for determining when thought
is protected:
1.
Does
the activity involve intellectual content comprised of ideas capable of
generating beliefs, opinions, or expressive content, thereby bringing it within
the scope of
s. 2
(b) protection?;
2.
Does
the method or location of the activity remove that protection?; and
3.
If
the activity is protected by
s. 2
(b), does the government action in question
infringe that protection, either in purpose or effect, through intrusion
manipulation or punishment and, if so, is it justified under
s. 1
of the
Charter
?
[
200
]
Applying this
test, I find the evidence supports a finding that the administration of psilocybin
in a psychedelic dose has the potential to change the thought process resulting
in cognitive flexibility i.e., the ability to think in more creative and diverse
ways. This can lead to changes in self-perception – how we think about
ourselves and the outside world. While the precise method by which this occurs is
not completely understood and cannot be guaranteed for everyone experiencing a
psychedelic dose, it does not change the fact that studies show this effect. This
was confirmed by both the Crown and defence experts. They indicated that psilocybin’s
impact on the thought process can last up to a month or more. It is precisely
for this reason that it is being pursued as a form of treatment for those
suffering from certain mental health disorders.
[
201
]
However, the
prohibition in this case does not target or restrict any specific thought with
specific expressible content. Given the random and unpredictable effects of
psilocybin on a given individual, what the prohibition restricts is access to
an experience that may or may not impact one’s general perception of themselves
and the outside world.
[
202
]
In my view, an
experience in these circumstances is not what freedom of thought was meant to
protect. If it did, it would open the door to innumerable other ways in which government
action prohibits experiences and thereby impacts our ability to derive a potential
thought-related benefit from that experience. Leaving aside whether that could
ever result in a successful “thought” related claim, I find that in this case,
that claim is too remote to warrant the protection of
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
.
[
203
]
Even if I am
wrong in this regard, like speech or other forms of expression, not every act
that impacts upon thought or the thought process is worthy of protection.
[
204
]
In the case of
psilocybin, I find that the means of generating the thought related effects in
this case are not worthy of
s. 2
(b) protection. In coming to this conclusion, 
I have considered the following:
(i)
The thought related effects of psilocybin are random and cannot be
predicted in advance. To this extent, I agree with the Crown that psilocybin is
not a precise tool for thought. It does not impact on thought in any way “akin
to the obvious, known, direct and controllable use of a tool to achieve precise
and foreseeable ends…”
[57]
(ii)
The
science with respect to psilocybin and its effect is still nascent. From a
scientific perspective, its long-term effects are still largely unknown. It is
not presently approved for medical use in Canada and is currently the subject
of at least two ongoing Phase III clinical trials which are scheduled to
conclude within the next few years. In these circumstances, the unpredictable
effect of psilocybin must be measured against the fact that its safety and
efficacy have yet to be established.
[
205
]
Finally, there
is no basis for finding that
s. 5(2)
, either in purpose or effect, intrudes
upon, manipulates or punishes a thought or forces forcing anyone to think in a
particular way. As indicated above, the purpose of the
CDSA
is public
safety and protection.
[
206
]
For these
reasons, I find that
s. 5
of the
CDSA
does not infringe
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
.
Section 7
of
the
Charter
[
207
]
The applicant’s challenge
under s. 7 is largely dependent on a finding that psilocybin is a
Charter
protected tool of thought.
[
208
]
In addition to
this, absent a valid medical purpose, our law does not recognize the right to
consume controlled substances. The decisions of the Supreme Court in
R v.
Malmo-Levine
[58]
and
R v. Clay
[59]
are dispositive.
[
209
]
In light of my ruling with respect to
s.
2
(b), I find that the right to access or administer psilocybin for non-medical,
thought-related purposes, is well outside the scope of the inherently private
and fundamentally personal choices protected by
s.
7
.
[
210
]
I also find that
the security of the person is not engaged in this case. Given that the choice
to access psilocybin does not attract
Charter
protection under 2(b), the
decision to access or administer psilocybin for non-medical purposes confines
it to a matter of a personal lifestyle choice. There is no evidence that the
prohibition imposed by
s. 5(2)
of the
CDSA
amount to state imposed
psychological stress.
[
211
]
Although security
of the person is triggered by the possibility of imprisonment, there is no
minimum sentence applicable in this case and the prospect of jail is low. It
cannot be said that the criminalization of the offence in this case is grossly
disproportionate. The tariff for similarly situated offenders (illegal
storefront employees with no criminal record) convicted of possessing a similar
quantity psilocybin for the purpose of trafficking, is still developing but is
presently in the range of a fine or a conditional discharge.
[
212
]
The blanket prohibition
under s. 5(2) with respect to psilocybin does not offend the principles of
fundamental justice. It is neither arbitrary, overbroad, or grossly disproportionate.
It bears connection to the purpose of the
CDSA
which is the protection
of public health and safety. While the risks of psilocybin use may be low, the
evidence satisfies me that it is not insignificant even when consumed in a
controlled setting. It is not overbroad given that the interests the applicant
seeks to protect, namely thought, would make psilocybin available to anyone who
sought its use for this purpose. It cannot be said that the prohibition in this
case is so extreme in relation to the interests it is mean to protect, namely
health and safety, particularly given that psilocybin alters brain function and
its effects are still being studied.
[
213
]
For these
reasons, I find that
section 5(2)
of the
CDSA
does not infringe
section
7
of the
Charter
.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
[
214
]
For all of the
above reasons, I find that
s. 5(2)
of the
CDSA
, does not infringe the
right to freedom of thought as contained in
s. 2(b)
of the
Charter
,
or

The Court considered
section 7

section 7
is to protect against the "deprivation" by the government of a life,
liberty

here; rather, the HCPs' asserted

arise only because they have asked for the right to possess a controlled
substance. They have voluntarily chosen to put themselves in jeopardy.”
