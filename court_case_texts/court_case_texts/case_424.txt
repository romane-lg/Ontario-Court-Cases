NORTH J.:
INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
Following
a preliminary inquiry, Mr. O’Donnell re-elected to be tried in the Ontario
Court of Justice.
[
2
]
He pleaded
guilty to one count of aggravated assault contrary to
section 268
of the
Criminal
Code
and one count of discharging a prohibited firearm contrary to
section
244(2)
(a) of the
Criminal Code
.
[
3
]
Both
offences occurred on July 31, 2023.
[
4
]
The
victim was Lacramioara Flanagan.
[
5
]
The
defence and the Crown agreed that in determining the appropriate sentence, in
addition to the contents of the Agreed Statement of Facts, I could consider the
evidence that I heard during the preliminary inquiry.  Ms. Flanagan was a
witness at the preliminary inquiry.
AGREED
STATEMENT OF FACTS
[
6
]
33 Eastmount
Avenue, Toronto, is a high-rise apartment building located in a residential
neighbourhood.   The apartment building is operated by Capreit, a property
management company.  In July, 2023, Ms. Flanagan was employed by Capreit as the
property manager for this building.
[
7
]
The management
office, where Ms. Flanagan worked, is on the ground floor of the building.  The
north side of the office has floor-to-ceiling windows to the street outside,
and Ms. Flanagan’s desk was situated next to these windows.  When she would sit
at her desk, her back was to the windows.
[
8
]
In July, 2023,
Mr. O’Donnell lived by himself in unit 2404 at 33 Eastmount Avenue. This unit
is on the 24
th
floor of the building.
[
9
]
During the
summer of 2023, Mr. O’Donnell came into conflict with the building management
in relation to various issues.  On July 19
th
, 2023, Ms. Flanagan
attended at Mr. O’Donnell’s apartment to discuss these issues with him.  When
she arrived at unit 2404, Ms. Flanagan noticed that there was a decorative
metalwork item attached to the front door of the unit.  Ms. Flanagan considered
this to be in breach of the building’s fire regulations, and removed the item
from the doorway.  Ms. Flanagan then returned to the management office, taking
the decorative item with her.
[
10
]
Ms. Flanagan
and Mr. O’Donnell met in the management office. They had an argument about the
above-mentioned issues. Mr. O’Donnell became upset with Ms. Flanagan. Mr.
O’Donnell took the decorative metal item from her and threw it onto the floor
in the office.  Mr. O’Donnell left shortly thereafter.
[
11
]
On July 31
st
,
2023, at approximately 7:01 AM, Mr. O’Donnell took the elevator from his unit
to the ground floor of the building.  He had with him a black coloured electric
bicycle (“E-bike”).  He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt.  Mr. O’Donnell exited
the building via the south-east exit and rode away on the E-bike.
[
12
]
Shortly after
7:01 AM on this same date, Mr. O’Donnell entered the underground parking lot of
the building, gaining entry via the car ramp.  While inside the parking lot,
Mr. O’Donnell retrieved a sawed-off shotgun, and shotgun shells.  Mr. O’Donnell
carried the shotgun, which was concealed in a bag, out of the parking lot. He
rode away on the E-bike.
[
13
]
At
approximately 8:00 AM on the same date, Ms. Flanagan arrived at the building
for work.  She entered the management office and sat at her desk, with her back
to the windows.
[
14
]
At 8:17 AM, Mr.
O’Donnell arrived at the north side of the building. He was riding the E-bike.  Mr.
O’Donnell stopped in front of the windows on the north side of the building,
outside the management office.  He was directly behind Ms. Flanagan, who was sitting
at her desk.  Mr. O’Donnell had changed his clothes.  At this point, he was
wearing black clothing.  He was also wearing a black medical face mask.
[
15
]
At that time,
Mr. O’Donnell produced the sawed-off shotgun from a bag and shouldered it.  He
fired the shotgun once, directly at Ms. Flanagan. Mr. O’Donnell was standing
approximately 10-12 feet away from Ms. Flanagan when he shot her.
The
shotgun pellets smashed through the window and struck Ms. Flanagan.  She
incurred injuries from the shotgun pellets to her right arm, left shoulder,
left arm, left chest, and neck.
[
16
]
Mr. O’Donnell
intended to shoot Ms. Flanagan, and he intended to seriously wound her.
[
17
]
The injuries
caused to Ms. Flanagan by this shooting amount to wounding and maiming as set
out in
section 268(1)
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
18
]
Mr. O’Donnell
placed the shotgun back into the bag and rode away on the E-bike.
[
19
]
At
approximately 10:15 AM, Mr. O’Donnell returned to the building on foot.  He did
not have the E-bike with him.  He had changed his clothes and was now wearing
the shorts and t-shirt that he had been wearing when he left the building
earlier that morning.
[
20
]
At
approximately 1:08 PM, Mr. O’Donnell attended at XYZ Storage facility, which is
located at 1 Laird Avenue, Toronto.   Mr. O’Donnell rented an outdoor parking
spot at this storage facility.  Mr. O’Donnell unloaded the E-bike from his
truck and placed it into a storage trailer that he had previously parked there.
[
21
]
On August 1
st
,
2023, at approximately 10:57 PM, a
Criminal Code
search warrant was
executed on Mr. O’Donnell’s residence.  Mr. O’Donnell was the only person inside
the unit before the police executed the warrant. He was arrested for attempted
murder.
[
22
]
During the
search of the unit, a disassembled Winchester model 370 12-gauge single shot
shotgun was located inside of a blue reusable shopping bag.  This was the
shotgun that Mr. O’Donnell used to shoot Ms. Flanagan.  The shotgun was found
in the closet of Mr. O’Donnell’s bedroom.
The gun was not locked, and
there was one 12-gauge shotgun round in the bag with the shotgun.
[
23
]
The shotgun and
the shotgun round were unsecured and carelessly stored in the residence.
[
24
]
The shotgun was
later examined by a qualified analyst, who determined it was a firearm as
defined in
section 2
of the
Criminal Code
.
The s
hotgun had been sawn off - the barrel of the shotgun
had been cut down in length.  The qualified analyst concluded that the shotgun
was a “prohibited firearm” as defined in
section 84
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
25
]
Mr. O’Donnell
was not legally authorized to possess the shotgun or the shotgun cartridge.
THE
OFFENDER
[
26
]
I
obtained information about Mr. O’Donnell from a pre-sentence report and a
psychiatric report.
[
27
]
Mr.
O’Donnell is currently 61 years old.
[
28
]
He
was born in Toronto.
[
29
]
He
completed grade 11. He described himself as an average student.
[
30
]
Mr.
O’Donnell is single.  He has never been married. He has no children.
[
31
]
Mr.
O’Donnell worked for 26 years with a municipal operation responsible for waste
management, until he retired a few years ago.
[
32
]
He
has a criminal record.  He has never previously been sentenced to a penitentiary
term of imprisonment.
[
33
]
In
1980, he was convicted of theft under $200; theft of an auto over $200 and
dangerous driving. He received a suspended sentence and a three year probation
order.
[
34
]
In
1991, he was convicted of assault, and received a suspended sentence, with a two
year probation order.
[
35
]
In
1995, he was convicted of impaired driving, and was sentenced to a $650 fine
and a one year driving prohibition.
[
36
]
In
2000, he was convicted of impaired driving, and was sentenced to a $2000 fine,
18 months of probation and a driving prohibition of three years.
[
37
]
His
parents are no longer alive.
[
38
]
Mr.
O’Donnell told the author of the pre-sentence report that he was raised in a
stable home environment without major trauma or neglect.
[
39
]
His
only sibling, his sister, passed away six years ago. She was 10 years older
than him. Mr. O’Donnell and his sister did not get along with each other. Apparently,
Mr. O’Donnell’s sister was hard on Mr. O’Donnell. According to Mr. O’Donnell,
his sister was abusive and blamed him for many of the difficulties their family
faced.
[
40
]
Mr. O’Donnell’s
cousin, Mike, recalled that Mr. O’Donnell, as a young child, always appeared “a
bit slow” at learning new things.   Mike was unaware of Mr. O’Donnell having
any formal history of mental health problems.   Mike had not noticed any recent
changes or decline in Mr. O’Donnell’s cognition or functioning.  Mike expressed
surprise by Mr. O’Donnell’s offence. Mike was unaware of Mr. O’Donnell being
violent in the past.
[
41
]
While
Mr. O’Donnell minimized his difficulty controlling his alcohol intake, there is
evidence to support the conclusion that he has suffered from alcohol abuse
issues, and he has related liver damage.
[
42
]
Mr.
O’Donnell suffered a shoulder injury when he was arrested by the police in this
case.
[
43
]
He
did not report any other history of medical illness, head injuries or seizures.
[
44
]
Mr.
O’Donnell denied any history of psychiatric diagnosis, psychiatric
hospitalizations or other treatment for psychotic issues.
[
45
]
Mr.
O’Donnell does not take any prescription medications.
[
46
]
When
asked about the offence, Mr. O’Donnell told the author of the pre-sentence
report that Ms. Flanagan never liked him.  He believed that she was picking on
him.  Mr. O’Donnell apparently thought that he was targeted by Ms. Flanagan in
an effort to remove him from the building.  When speaking with the doctor who
prepared the psychiatric report (Dr. Paul Benassi), Mr. O’Donnell described Ms.
Flanagan as “not very nice”.  Mr. O’Donnell said that he was angry that Ms.
Flanagan had evicted other residents of the building.  When describing the
offences to the psychiatrist, he said “it wasn’t the right thing to do” and “I shouldn’t
have done it.”  He stated that his intention when he committed the offences was
to “scare” Ms. Flanagan , and to “teach her a lesson.”
[
47
]
Mr.
O’Donnell has been involved in hunting for years, and one of his relatives
speculated that is the reason he had access to a firearm.  Mr. O’Donnell told
the doctor who conducted the assessment that he had owned the firearm for 15 to
20 years.
[
48
]
Mr. O’Donnell
denied using alcohol or any other substances on the date of the offences.  He
did not report experiencing depressed, elevated or irritable mood over the two
weeks leading up to the offences.  He also denied any specific stressors at the
time, other than his frustration with Ms. Flanagan.
[
49
]
Mr.
O’Donnell described himself as an “easy going” person and denied having issues
with anger or aggression.
[
50
]
Dr.
Benassi concluded that Mr. O’Donnell “meets the criteria for alcohol use
disorder”.
[
51
]
Dr.
Benassi also concluded that Mr. O’Donnell is “likely to have an unspecified
neurodevelopmental disorder.”  A neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized
by deficits in attention, memory, perception, language, problems solving or
social interaction.  Given that Mr. O’Donnell was able to maintain employment
and live independently for years as an adult, it was Dr. Benassi’s view that
the severity of Mr. O’Donnell’s deficits are “most likely to be mild or
borderline.”
[
52
]
Dr.
Benassi was of the view that Mr. O’Donnell “may also meet criteria for an “unspecified
neurocognitive disorder”.  An unspecified neurocognitive disorder is
characterized by a cognitive deficit with an underlying medical cause. It
affects one or more cognitive domains such as memory and learning, executive
functions, attention, and social cognition.  Significantly, Dr. Benassi noted
that there was no information to suggest that Mr. O’Donnell had recently experienced
an observable deficit in his adaptive functioning.
VICTIM
IMPACT STATEMENT
[
53
]
A
victim impact statement, dated September 14, 2024, was filed as an exhibit by
the Crown on behalf of Ms. Flanagan.  It described how Ms. Flanagan’s life has
been impacted by the shooting.
[
54
]
Ms.
Flanagan divided her statement into four main areas:
•
emotional
impact;
•
physical
impact;
•
economic
impact; and
•
fear
for her security.
[
55
]
I
will review some of what Ms. Flanagan wrote under each of these headings.
[
56
]
I
will start first with “emotional impact”.  Since the shooting, Ms. Flanagan was
diagnosed with PTSD and major depression.  She has “intense fear and anxiety”
when she is outside her home.  I note that during the preliminary inquiry, Ms.
Flanagan testified that since the shooting she did not often leave her home.  She
has experienced anxiety and panic attacks when she sees a bicycle.  She is
unable to experience joy, and feels flat and indifferent.   She feels a sense
of worthlessness, as a result of losing her job.  Her self-esteem has been
affected, as she no longer has the feeling of accomplishment that she received
from her job.  She said that losing her job has made her feel “adrift and
powerless” She has also experienced rapid mood changes and finds it difficult
to regulate her emotions.  She has experienced nightmares and often dreams
about being shot.
[
57
]
Turning
to the physical impact of the offences.  Ms. Flanagan states that the shooting
has impacted a number of areas of her body, “especially due to the bullet
fragments that remain entrenched”.  Ms. Flanagan states that, as September,
2024, there were 15 fragments that were still in her body.  The fragments left
her with numbness in her right hand. She has scars on her neck, chest, and both
arms.  She has seen a number of doctors and therapists to deal with her
depression, anxiety and PTSD.
[
58
]
I
will next address the economic impact of the shooting.  Ms. Flanagan states
that losing her job and being on long term disability was “one of the hardest
blows to handle”.  Ms. Flanagan had to deal with an “immediate and severe”
financial strain.
[
59
]
Finally,
Ms. Flanagan said that her sense of safety has been completely shattered, and
that every day feels like she is in a battle against fear.
[
60
]
Ms.
Flanagan ended her statement by stating that despite the challenges that she
faces, she is determined to reclaim her strength and find comfort in the
support of her loved ones and the community.
POSITIONS
OF THE PARTIES
Position
of the Crown
[
61
]
The
Crown takes the position that the Court should impose a custodial sentence of 8
years, less credit for pre-sentence custody, harsh conditions of detention, and
strict bail conditions.
[
62
]
The
Crown also requested a number of ancillary orders.
Position
of the Defence
[
63
]
The
defence takes the position that the Court should impose a custodial sentence of
5 ½ years, less credit for pre-sentence custody, harsh conditions of
pre-sentence custody and strict bail conditions.
[
64
]
The
defence is not opposed to the ancillary orders that were requested by the
Crown.
THE
PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING, AND THEIR APPLICATION IN THIS CASE
[
65
]
A sentencing
judge must impose a sentence that reflects the fundamental purpose of
sentencing and the relevant sentencing objectives and principles.
[
66
]
The fundamental
purpose of sentencing is to contribute to “respect for the law and the
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society” by imposing just sanctions
that have one or more of the following objectives:
•
to denounce
unlawful conduct;
•
to deter the
offender and other persons from committing offences;
•
to separate offenders
from society, where necessary;
•
to assist in
rehabilitating offenders;
•
to provide
reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and
•
to promote a
sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to
victims and the community.
[
67
]
The
relevance and weight to be given to these objectives will vary depending on the
nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.
[
68
]
The
objectives of denunciation and deterrence will usually dominate the other
objectives when an offence is particularly serious:
R. v. Hamilton and Mason
,
(2004)
2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA)
,
72 OR (3d) 1 (CA)
, at paragraph
103
.
[
69
]
There is no
dispute that the offences before the Court are serious.
[
70
]
In
firearms-related cases, the sentencing objectives of general deterrence and
denunciation are given priority:
See
R. v. Aden
,
2025 ONCJ 3
, at paragraph
48
.
[
71
]
Courts in
Ontario have consistently concluded that offences of this nature will not be
tolerated and the punishment for committing them will be severe:
Aden
, at
paragraph
48
.
[
72
]
In my view,
deterrence and denunciation are the paramount sentencing considerations in this
case.
[
73
]
A
determination of what constitutes a fit sentence
requires a court to consider the life experiences of
the person standing before them:
R.
v. Ipeelee
,
2012
SCC 13
,
1 SCR 433
, at paragraph
75
.
See also
R. v. Parranto
,
2021 SCC 46
, at paragraph
44
.
[
74
]
However,
factors that may mitigate an offender’s personal responsibility “cannot justify
a disposition that unduly minimizes the seriousness of the crime committed”:
Hamilton
and Mason
, at paragraph
93
.
[
75
]
In this case,
when determining the appropriate sentence, I have taken into account the
opinion of Dr. Benassi that Mr. O’Donnell meets the criteria for alcohol use
disorder, is likely to have an unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder and may
also meet the criteria for unspecified neurocognitive disorder.
[
76
]
Mr. O’Donnell
is 61 years old.  He is not a first offender.  While rehabilitation is a
relevant consideration in determining the appropriate sentence, it is not a
paramount objective. As I have already stated, deterrence and denunciation are
the paramount sentencing objectives in this case.
[
77
]
Mr. O’Donnell
has been subject to a bail order since February 20, 2024 and has not breached
the conditions of that order.  That is a relevant consideration
when assessing
rehabilitative prospects. Mr. O’Donnell has received the support of some
members of his family, which – if it continues in the future – may potentially
assist in his rehabilitation.
[
78
]
Based
on all the evidence – including what Mr. O’Donnell said to the authors of the
PSR and the psychiatric report – it is my conclusion that he has little insight
into the harm that he has caused and has limited remorse for the harm he caused
to Ms. Flanagan.
[
79
]
Given
his age, and what I have found is both limited evidence of remorse and limited
insight into the significant harm that he caused, I cannot conclude that Mr.
O’Donnell’s rehabilitative prospects are strong.
[
80
]
I will now turn
to the fundamental principle of sentencing, which is proportionality.
Section
718.1
of the
Criminal Code
provides that:
“A
sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.”
[
81
]
The gravity of
these offences is very high.
[
82
]
The
Supreme Court of Canada in
R. v. Friesen
,
2020 SCC 9
, paragraphs
96-97
,
observed that maximum sentences help determine the gravity of an offence.
[
83
]
Aggravated
assault and discharging a prohibited firearm with intent are both offences that
are punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. With respect
to the later offence, in the circumstances of this case, there is a mandatory
minimum sentence of five years imprisonment (see
section 244(2)
(a)(i) of the
Criminal
Code
).
[
84
]
Turning to Mr.
O’Donnell’s degree of responsibility.  Even after taking into account Dr.
Benassi’s opinion that Mr. O’Donnell likely has one or more disorders that he
has been dealing with – which potentially may have affected his judgment and
decision making – in my view, Mr. O’Donnell’s degree of responsibility for the
commission of these offences is very high.  He carefully planned the commission
of these offences, which involved a targeted attack on Ms. Flanagan.
[
85
]
As previously
stated, Ms. Flanagan testified at the preliminary inquiry.  She was a credible
witness.  In my view, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that Ms.
Flanagan intentionally provoked or annoyed Mr. O’Donnell.  Ms. Flanagan was
simply doing her job, which included ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone
in the building.
[
86
]
While
proportionality is the fundamental principle of sentencing, other principles found
in s. 718.2 must also be considered when determining the appropriate sentence,
including:
•
a sentence
should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or
mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender;
•
a court must
take into account evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the
victim; and
•
a sentence
should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar
offences committed in similar circumstances.
[
87
]
In
this case, Mr. O’Donnell’s guilty plea is a mitigating factor.
[
88
]
The
mitigating effect of a guilty plea will vary in weight from case to case.  A
guilty plea where there is a genuine issue for trial may be worthy of more
weight than a guilty plea in circumstances where the Crown’s case is very
strong:
R. v. Lynch
,
2022 ONCA 109
, at paragraph
20
. A guilty plea in a
case where the trial may take a significant amount of court time may be worthy
of greater weight than a case in which the trial would last a day or two:
Lynch
,
at paragraph
20
. Mr. O’Donnell’s guilty plea saved significant resources in the
Superior Court of Justice.
[
89
]
Mr. O’Donnell
did not plead guilty at an early stage of the process.  He pleaded guilty after
Ms. Flanagan testified at the preliminary inquiry.
[
90
]
In
assessing the weight that should be given to the guilty plea, I have taken into
account that the Crown’s case was very strong.
[
91
]
As I
have already stated, it is my conclusion that Mr. O’Donnell is not very
remorseful for the harm he caused to Ms. Flanagan.
[
92
]
I
view the guilty plea in this case to be worthy of medium weight.
[
93
]
In my view, the
casual link between the commission of these offences and the psychiatric disorders
identified by Dr. Benassi is not clear.
[
94
]
Furthermore,
while Mr. O’Donnell has some cognitive limitations, he was clearly capable of
planning this attack and carrying out his plan.
[
95
]
In my view, Mr.
O’Donnell’s psychiatric disorders or cognitive limitations are not significant
mitigating factors.
[
96
]
There was no
evidence that Mr. O’Donnell was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when he
committed these offences.
[
97
]
I do not view
the injuries that Mr. O’Donnell suffered when he was arrested as a significant mitigating
factor.  Based on the evidence that I heard during the preliminary inquiry, the
use of force by the police, in these circumstances, was reasonable.
[1]
[
98
]
There
are a number of aggravating factors, and they include:
•
The
pre-meditated nature of the offences, which involved a targeted attack on Ms.
Flanagan.  Mr. O’Donnell took steps before and after the commission of the
offences to avoid detection.
•
Mr.
O’Donnell used a prohibited weapon to shoot Ms. Flanagan.
•
Mr.
O’Donnell intended to shoot Ms. Flanagan and intended to seriously wound her.
•
Ms.
Flanagan was defenceless.  She had her back to Mr. O’Donnell.  He was 10-12
feet from Ms. Flanagan when he shot her.
•
There
was significant physical, emotional and financial harm caused by Mr. O’Donnell.
The shooting caused
profound and long-lasting harm to Ms. Flanagan.
[
99
]
While
Mr. O’Donnell is not a first offender, his other offences are dated and
unrelated. I do not view his criminal record as a significant aggravating
factor.
Firearm
Offences and Range of Sentence

100
]
In
R.
v. Lacasse
,
2015 SCC 64
, at paragraph
89
, the Supreme Court of Canada
stated that “the frequency of a type of offence in a particular region can
certainly be a relevant factor for a sentencing judge.”
[
101
]
In
R.
v. George
,
2023 ONCJ 298
, at paragraph
8
, Justice Fraser noted that in
recent years there has been a dangerous increase in gun crimes in Toronto.
[
102
]
Crimes

In

of sentencing for dangerous firearm related offences of 7 to 11 years.
[
107
]
In
Aden
,
at paragraph
57
, Justice Jones recently observed that a review of the
authorities demonstrates sentences for similar offences “may deviate from this
established range, running as low as five to six years, and, in some cases, as
high as 12 years or more.”  That is not surprising, as sentencing is an
individualized exercise, and sentencing ranges are not meant to handcuff the
court.  There will “always be situations that call for a sentence outside a
particular range”:
Lacasse
, at paragraph
58

[
108
]
In
the case at bar, counsel provided me with a number of authorities, which I have
reviewed and considered.
[
109
]
I
have also considered the thorough review of the sentencing caselaw of similar
offences that Justice Jones recently conducted, at paragraphs 56 to 78,
in
Aden
.
[
110
]
In
my view, the sentencing authorities provided to the court by the defence are
factually distinguishable for a number of reasons from the facts in the case at
bar.  Having said that, there are almost always distinguishing facts and
features between a case at bar and previous cases. Every case is unique, and
sentencing is an individualized process.
[
111
]
The
following features of this case, in my view, make this case significantly different
from the authorities that the defence provided to the court.
[
112
]
This
case involved a planned and targeted attack, using a firearm, by a mature man
with a criminal record against a defenceless victim in which the victim was
shot from behind (from a distance of about 10 feet) and the victim suffered
significant physical and emotional harm.
Harsh
Conditions of Detention
(
Duncan
/
Marshall
)
[
113
]
In
R.
v. Duncan
,
2016 ONCA 754
,
the
Court of Appeal concluded that in appropriate circumstances particularly harsh
pre-sentence incarceration conditions can provide mitigation apart from and
beyond the 1.5 credit referred to in section 719(3.1).
In
Duncan
,
the Court went on to say that in considering whether any enhanced credit should
be given, a Court must consider both the conditions of the pre-sentence
incarceration and the impact of those conditions on the accused.
[
114
]
There is no mathematical formula
for determining the amount of enhanced credit for harsh pre-sentence
incarceration conditions.
[
115
]
In
R. v. Marshall
,
2021 ONCA
344
, at paragraphs
51 to 53
, the Court of Appeal clarified how harsh
pre-sentence conditions of pre-sentence custody should be taken into account by
a sentencing judge.  The Court concluded at paragraph 52 as follows:
“The “
Duncan
” credit is not a deduction from
the otherwise appropriate sentence, but is one of the factors to be taken into
account in determining the appropriate sentence. Particularly punitive pretrial
incarceration conditions can be a mitigating factor to be taken into account
with the other mitigating and aggravating factors in arriving at the
appropriate sentence from which the “
Summers
” credit will be deducted.
Because the “
Duncan
” credit is one of the mitigating factors to be
taken into account, it cannot justify the imposition of a sentence which is
inappropriate, having regard to all of the relevant mitigating or aggravating
factors.”
[
116
]
In
Marshall
, at paragraph
53
, the Court went on to say that while quantifying the specific number of days
that are given as a
Duncan
credit is not necessarily inappropriate, it
may skew the calculation of the ultimate sentence.

]
In this case, a summary of the time
that Mr. O’Donnell spent subject to lockdowns while at the Toronto South
Detention Centre was filed as an exhibit.
Mr. O’Donnell was subject to either full or
partial lockdowns on 24 occasions.  The reason for most of the lockdowns was
staff shortages.
[
118
]
In
R. v. Ahmed
,
2021 ONSC
8157
, at paragraph
40
, Justice Schreck observed that:
“…the conditions at the TSDC have been the subject of
frequent judicial criticism.”
[
119
]
I accept that, as a result of
lockdowns, Mr. O’Donnell experienced particularly harsh conditions of detention
that warrant consideration:

[

Following
the guidance provided by the
Court
of Appeal
in
Marshall
,
at paragraph
53
, I have not set out a specified number of days as a
Duncan
credit.  Instead, I have considered it as a mitigating factor that I have taken
into account, together with the other mitigating and aggravating factors, when
determining the appropriate sentence.
Summers
Credit
[

]
Mr. O’Donnell
was arrested on August 1, 2023.  He was released from custody on February 20,
2024.
[
122
]
He served
a total of 203 real days (or just over 6 months and 19 days) in custody at the
Toronto South Detention Centre.  On a 1.5 to 1 basis, Mr. O’Donnell will
receive 305 days of enhanced credit.

Downes
Credit

In
R.
v.
Downes
,
(2006)
2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA)
,
79 O.R. (3d) 321
, the Court of Appeal held that in
some circumstances it will be appropriate to give credit (and consider as a
mitigating factor) the time an offender spent under strict bail conditions.
[
124
]
As
the Court of Appeal
stated in
R. v. Joseph
,
2020 ONCA 733
, at paragraph
114
, “The relevant inquiry is whether bail conditions were punitive enough to
be akin to punishment, thereby warranting mitigation.”
[
125
]
While
the impact of bail conditions cannot be assumed, there are some restrictions,
such as house arrest, from which inferences can be drawn and the impact is
obvious:
R. v. Daley
,
2016 ONSC 3513
.
[
126
]
There
is no mathematical formula to be applied when determining the appropriate
credit.
[
127

Whether
a
Downes

trial judge:
R. v. Eden
,
2021 ONCA 733
, at paragraph
10
.
[
128
]
A
number of factors must be taken into account when determining the amount of
credit for harsh bail conditions, including:
•
The
length of time spent on bail;
•
The
stringency of the conditions;
•
The
impact on the accused’s liberty;
•
The
ability of the accused to carry out normal relations, employment and
activities; and
•
Any
particular impact on the accused.
[

]
The
offender
in
Downes
was subject to a house arrest condition for 18 months
with an exception that allowed him to be outside his home when he was in the
company of his surety.  The Court of Appeal concluded that five months’ credit
was appropriate.
[
130
]
In
R.
v. Mok
,
[2017] OJ No. 3758 (Ont. Sup Court)
, Justice McMahon gave 14
months’ credit for a 28 month period during which the accused was under strict
house arrest with electronic monitoring.  The accused in that case was
separated from his wife and children, and they were unable to travel to Canada
to visit him.

In
Joseph
,

, the Court of Appeal concluded that the sentencing judge erred
by giving a 1:1 credit for the time an accused spent subject to house arrest.

R. v. Fobister
,
2010 ONCA 7
, at paragraph 2
.
In
Joseph
,
at paragraph
112
, the Court held that house arrest is very different from jail,
and “it is an error to equate them”.
[

Having
said that, house arrest is a significant restriction on liberty and there is,
unlike jail, no remission:
R. v. Mori
,
2020 ONCJ 620
, at paragraph
34
.
[
133
]
In
this case, Mr. O’Donnell has been on a strict bail order since February 20,
2024. He has had an ankle monitor and is subject to house arrest, with no
exceptions unless he is in the company of a surety.
[
134
]
I am
satisfied that the bail order that Mr. O’Donnell has been subject to was
restrictive and it had an impact on his liberty interests.
[
135
]
In
my view, it is appropriate to credit Mr. O’Donnell with 90 days
for the restrictive bail
conditions.
CONCLUSION
[
136
]
Mr. Pearce said
everything that could be said on behalf of Mr. O’Donnell.
[
137
]
The seriousness
of the offences is clear.  The offences involved a calculated, planned and
deliberate attack, with a prohibited firearm, on a defenseless victim.
[
138
]
Mr. O’Donnell
caused real and long-lasting harm to Ms. Flanagan.
[
139
]
These offences were
the product of, in Mr. O’Donnell’s mind, a perceived slight or slights by Ms.
Flanagan.  Once again, I find that Ms. Flanagan did nothing wrong.  The actions
of Ms. Flanagan prior to the commission of the offence were very different than
the conduct of the victim prior to the shooting
in
R. v. Harrison
,
2024
ONSC 3272
.
[
140
]
After taking
into account all the relevant circumstances (including Mr. O’Donnell’s age), I
have concluded that the appropriate sentence (before taking into account
Downes
or
Summers
credit - but after taking into account
harsh pre-sentence incarceration conditions)
is 2859 days
imprisonment.
[2]
[
141
]
While this is a
lengthy first sentence in the penitentiary, the offences in this case are very
serious. In my view, this sentence is proportionate to the seriousness of the
offences and Mr. O’Donnell’s degree of responsibility.
[
142
]
After deducting
the
Summers
credit (305 days) and the
Downes
credit (90 days),
the remaining time left to be served on each count (as of February 20, 2025) is
2464 days imprisonment (or 81 months).
[3]
The sentences will be served concurrently with each other.
[
143
]
The 305 days of
enhanced pre-sentence custody will be noted on the information.
[
144
]
I also make the
following ancillary orders:
•
Aggravated
assault and discharge of a firearm with intent are primary designated offences
under
section 487.05(1)
of the
Criminal Code
.  Mr. O’Donnell will be
required to provide a suitable DNA sample.
•
A section 109
order for 10 years.
•
Pursuant to
section
743.21
of the
Criminal Code
, while serving the custodial part of his
sentence, Mr. O’Donnell must not communicate, directly or indirectly, with Ms.
Flanagan.
•
Pursuant to
section
491
of the
Criminal Code
, the firearm seized by the police is forfeited
to His Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General directs.
[
145
]
Finally, I see
no reasonable basis to waive the victim surcharge. Since he retired, Mr.
O’Donnell has received a pension.  He has the ability to pay the victim
surcharge.  The imposition of the surcharge would not cause undue hardship to
Mr. O’Donnell and it would not be disproportionate to the gravity of the
offences or the degree of Mr. O’Donnell’s responsibility for those offences. Mr.
O’Donnell has 3 months to pay the surcharge.

In
arriving at this conclusion, I find that Constable Ted Tompras, the ETF officer
who testified at the preliminary inquiry about his interaction with Mr. O’Donnell
was a credible witness.  Constable Tompras provided reliable evidence. I accept
Constable Tompras’s account of what occurred.

Approximately 7 years and 10 months.
