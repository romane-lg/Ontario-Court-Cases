PRINGLE
J.:
[
1
]
Mr. Senthilgumar is charged with a
single count of operating a conveyance while his ability to do so was impaired
to any degree, by alcohol or a drug or both, contrary to
section 320.14(1)
of
the
Criminal Code
.
[
2
]
There was no evidence of any
alcohol being present in the defendant’s blood or breath.
The
Crown’s
case
was
premised
on
the
theory
that
his
ability
to
drive
was
impaired
to some degree by drug and more specifically by cannabis.
[
3
]
The defendant was
not
tried,
and was
apparently not
charged, with the offence of having
a
blood
drug
concentration
(BDC)
over
the
legal
limit
within
two
hours
of
operating
a motor vehicle.
[
4
]
The entire trial
proceeded by way of agreed fact. It was uncontested that on October 24, 2023,
in the early morning hours, the defendant was operating a motor vehicle when he
crossed a lane and hit a truck. This accident happened sometime between 7:30
and 8:00 AM.
[
5
]
The
collision
caused
damage
to
the
truck.
Its
passengers,
who
were
not
seriously
injured, came out of their truck to check on the defendant’s car. They called
911, discerning from the circumstances that the defendant was in some kind of
medical distress. Specifically, they thought he was having a seizure.
[
6
]
A police officer arrived and saw
the defendant being treated by paramedics. He made observations of the
defendant’s physical appearance. The defendant was awake but appeared confused,
sweaty and drowsy.
[
7
]
There
was
an
agreed
statement
of
fact
about
Mr.
Senthilgumar’s
appearance
after the accident, which said:
It is agreed that Mr.
Senthilgumar’s presentation after the collision
is
consistent
with
a
person
who
has
just
experienced a seizure otherwise known as a
‘post ictal’ state.
[
8
]
The officer found a vape pen and
“marijuana products” in the passenger seat of the defendant’s vehicle. The
agreed statement of fact does not make clear what kind of marijuana
products
were
located.
I
understood
the
inclusion
of
this
fact
to
explain
why
the officer took the next
step he did. He arrested the defendant for impaired driving.
[
9
]
The
defendant
was
taken
to
hospital
and,
en
route,
had
a
seizure.
At
hospital,
they took a sample of his blood “before or
at 8:55 am”.
[
10
]
This blood sample was analyzed by
CFS forensic scientist Zacharie Currie. He found the concentration of THC in
the defendant's
blood to be 72 ng/ml
with a variability of six nanograms per milliliter. His report was attached to
the agreed statement of fact and was also accepted as fact.
[
11
]
Both parties agreed that this THC
measurement reflected the THC concentration in
the
defendant's
blood
at
the
time
the
blood
was
drawn.
They
also
agreed
the
defendant consumed no THC
between the time of the collision and the time his blood was taken.
[
12
]
There was no direct evidence as to
the THC concentration, in the defendant's blood,
at
the
time
he
was
operating
the
motor
vehicle.
There
was
no
evidence
before
this court to assist with issues such as the absorption and elimination
of THC, or if and how that may vary from person to person. There was no
evidence as to when the cannabis was consumed by the defendant, or how he
consumed cannabis, whether it be orally or inhalation. The vape pen suggested
inhalation, but vape pens are commonly used to inhale other substances.
[
13
]
The CFS report set out and
explained the following conclusions. The detected blood concentration of THC
indicated the defendant’s:
…prior use of a cannabis product.
THC can impair an individual's ability to operate a motor vehicle. Blood
concentrations of THC do not correlate well with effects; however, effects that
can occur following recent use of THC include
altered
time
perception,
incoordination
and
decreased ability to concentrate. The
effects of THC are dependent on factors including dose, the time and route of
administration and experience of the user.
[
14
]
To be clear, the author of this
report proffered no opinion whatsoever relative to the
question
of
impairment
in
this
case,
including
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
at
the time he was operating the motor
vehicle, impaired to any degree. Instead, the Crown sought to prove this
circumstantially, inviting the drawing of inferences.
[
15
]
The
defence
called
no
evidence.
[
16
]
Both sides agreed that there could be no reasonable
doubt about the defendant operating
a
conveyance
that
morning.
In
arguing
impairment
to
any
degree,
from
slight
to great,
was
proved
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
the
Crown
relied
on
the
level
of
THC
located in
the
defendant's
blood
and
how
that
level
compared
with
the
legislation
and
regulations
Parliament enacted about legal limits of THC.
[
17
]
Specifically,
in
revising
the
impaired
driving
related
offence
provisions,
Parliament enacted
prescribed
blood
drug
concentrations
of
between
2
and
5
nanograms
of
THC
per milliliter
of
blood. That
range
applies
to
offences
committed
by operating
a
motor
vehicle while
over
those
various
limits.
There
is
no
prescribed
blood
drug
concentration
level
with respect to
the specific offence of impaired operation by drug, which
is the charge before this court.
[
18
]
The Crown emphasized that the BDC
in the case at bar was approximately 33 times greater than the bottom range of
the prescribed legal limits. She also relied upon
the decision of
R. v.
Robertson
,
2022 ONCJ 160
, where my colleague Caponecchia J. upheld the
constitutionality of the prescribed limits and related offence provisions.
[
19
]
At paragraphs 107 through 111, Caponecchia
J. in the context of upholding the constitutionality
of
the
legislation
and
regulations,
found
a
rational
connection
established between
the
limit
of
five
nanograms
per
milliliter
of
THC
and
the
objective
of
the
legislation which is to detect drivers
impaired by THC. She relied upon, in drawing that conclusion, expert testimony
about the effects of 5 nanograms per milliliter on recreational or naive
consumers, and that the reading can suggest recent consumption, which in turn
can permit a court to infer that an individual is impaired by THC while
driving.
[
20
]
In
my
opinion,
it
is
a
stretch
to
draw,
from
this
aspect
of
the
constitutional
decision,
a conclusion that a reading over 5 nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood
necessarily equates to proof beyond reasonable doubt of impairment. I
appreciate that only slight impairment by drug need be proven by the Crown.
However, even slight impairment by drug must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[
21
]
The
Robertson
case
was
decided in two separate judgments, the second which reinforced this conclusion.
In
R. v. Robertson
,
2021 O.J. No. 7559
, the same defendant was acquitted
of the charge of impaired driving. The defendant had readings of 40 nanograms
of THC in one milliliter of blood. He also had a lower reading, subsequently
taken, of 15 nanograms per milliliter.
[
22
]
The
defendant
was
proven
to
have
THC
in
his
blood,
but
the
court
was
not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
he was impaired to any degree by drug while driving because there were other
available, reasonable inferences that could be drawn.
[
23
]
In that case, expert evidence was
called by the Crown. A forensic toxicologist testified that the BDC level of 40
nanograms was detected 45 minutes after a collision, and
that
it
could
not
be
correlated
to
any
degree
of
impairment
at
the
time
of
the
collision.
[
24
]
The test result did not assist
with the question of whether the defendant was a frequent
or
infrequent
user.
It
did
not
prove
that
the
defendant
consumed
it
in
the
morning before
the
accident. Factors
such
as
timing,
quantity consumed, and
tolerance level can all
bear
weight
on
the
question
of
impairment,
and
there
was
no
proof
beyond
reasonable doubt that the defendant was
experiencing the impairing effects of THC at the time he was driving.
[
25
]
The danger of concluding that
proof of impairment beyond reasonable doubt is made out solely by comparing BDC
readings to the legal limit, was exemplified, at least for me, by paragraph 41
of the trial
decision in
Robertson
:
Ms. Chow [
C.F.S. expert
]
explained that the 40ng/ml of THC detected in Mr. Robertson's blood 45 minutes
after the collision cannot be correlated to any
degree of impairment at 1:00
p.m.
or
earlier.
Nor
does
it
reveal
if
Mr.
Robertson
was
a naïve user or frequent user. The
toxicology evidence proves that Mr. Robertson consumed an unknown amount of
cannabis
between
7:00
a.m.
--
9:00
a.m.
the
morning
of
June 18, 2020. Depending on
the timing, quantity consumed and his
tolerance
level
he
may
or
may
not
have
been
experiencing the impairing effects of THC
when he caused the collision at approximately 12:15 p.m.
[
26
]
The trial judge then looked to
other evidence, outside those readings, to assess whether
it
was
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
experiencing
the impairing
effects of THC
while
driving. She concluded it
was not.
For
example,
evidence about the physical appearance of the defendant at the
scene led to more than one reasonable inference. He had suffered significant
physical injuries in the crash, and accordingly, his speech and balance and
walk could not be meaningfully assessed.
[
27
]
The trial judge observed, at para.
43, that "there is no evidence to support an inference
that
the
accused
consumed
the
cannabis
close
in
time
to
the
accident
and
was
operating
under
the
impairing
effects" because
first
responders
had
covid
masks
on
and were unable to detect smells like
freshly smoked cannabis.
[
28
]
The
trial
outcome
in
Robertson
is
not
binding
on
me,
and
the
evidence
in
that
case cannot be used as evidence in this case. I appreciate that.
However, the conclusion in
that case
reinforced the defence submission in the case at bar, which was that proof of
impaired driving by drug, could not be made out beyond a reasonable doubt,
solely by the
BDC
reading
of
72
nanograms
of
THC
in
1
ml
of
blood
compared
to
the
Regulations
.
[
29
]
I have not lost sight of the fact
of the accident in this case. The Crown, fairly, did not rely on it as evidence
of impairment. She referred to it as a bit of a red herring and acknowledged
the
accident
could
have
been
rooted
in
medical
causes.
But
I
am
still required to
assess all the evidence, as a whole and including this accident. Thus, I will
subsequently return to the topic.
[
30
]
Defence counsel drew analogies
between the circumstances in this case and precedent about impaired driving and
the legal limit for blood alcohol levels while operating
a
motor
vehicle.
For
example,
R.
v.
Kumar,
[2022]
O.J.
No.
1060
observed
that without expert testimony, a court was not permitted to take
judicial notice that a person who consumed a specific certain amount of alcohol
before driving was impaired.
[
31
]
In
R.
v.
Letford
,
2000 CanLII 17024 (ON CA)
,
[2000]
O.J.
No.
4841
at
para.
22
,
the
Court
of
Appeal
held
the
trial
judge was in error to rely on BAC results without expert evidence to infer the
appellant was
impaired
by
alcohol.
In
R.
v.
Hoffner,
2005 CanLII 32924 (ON SC)
,
[2005]
O.J.
No.
3862
,
the
appellants’
conviction for
impaired
driving
was
overturned.
The
trial
judge
had
improperly
used
high
BAC
results,
without
expert
testimony,
to
conclude
the
appellants
memory
must
have
been
unreliable.
The
appellate
court
relied
upon
cases,
such
as
Letford
,
by
way
of
analogy.
The
test
results which those cases said could not
be used to infer impairment, could also not be used to support conclusion that
a person's memory of events was unreliable and impaired by alcohol: see paras.
66-68.
[
32
]
In
R. v. Cabral,
[1988] O.J. No. 2170
, a
conviction for impaired driving was overturned because of a similar error committed
at trial. The trial judge had improperly taken judicial notice in relation to
the amount of alcohol consumed, and inferred that amount was enough to impair a
person while driving. Without expert testimony, Hill J. sitting as a summary
conviction appeal court concluded, the trial court should not have used
the
amount
of
alcohol
consumed
to
conclude
that
amount
was
sufficient
to
impair
a person. See also
R. v. Kumric,
[2006]
O.J. No. 4886
[Durno J. – S.C.A.D.]
[
33
]
In considering these authorities,
in application to the case at bar, I agree with defence counsel that I cannot
take judicial notice in the manner the Crown invites. More specifically,
I
cannot
take
judicial
notice
that
when
compared
to
the
legal
limits
prescribed by statute, the BDC present in
the defendant’s blood proves impairment, be it slight or great, beyond
reasonable doubt.
[
34
]
This
conclusion
does
not
end
the
analysis.
All
of
the
evidence
must
be
considered, in determining whether the
count before the court was proven to the requisite standard. The test for proof
of impairment beyond reasonable doubt, and the application of the often-cited
Stellato standard, was well explained
in
R. v. Andrews,
1996 ABCA 21
(CanLII)
at paras.
19
, 20, and 26:
… [I]t is so important not to
deal with the issue of impairment separate from impairment of one's ability to
drive. Stellato must not be understood to mean that a person who has anything
to
drink
and
then
drives
a
motor
vehicle
commits
the offence under s. 253(a) [now 253(1)
(a)]. Nor does it mean any lack of sobriety is sufficient...
The ratio of judgment in Stellato
is that
it is
not necessary for the
Crown
to establish
a
marked
degree
of
impairment
of
the
accused's
ability
to
drive;
rather,
any
degree
of
impairment
of
that
ability
if
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
will
sustain
a
conviction.
...[Stellato] speaks to degree of
proof. In other words, as framed in Stellato the conduct must be of such a
nature that an
impairment
of
the
ability
to
operate
a
vehicle
(be
it
slight
or marked impairment) is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
[
35
]
Stellato’s
use of the word “slight” should not be understood as
lessening the Crown’s burden of proof in any way. The impairment proven can be
slight. The proof of impairment remains to the standard of beyond reasonable
doubt.
[
36
]
In considering the evidence as a whole I am not
satisfied the Crown proved its burden beyond reasonable doubt. More
specifically, the Crown has not proven beyond reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant’s
ability
to
drive
was
impaired
to
any
degree
by
drug.
[
37
]
As
stated,
after
reviewing
the
trial
result
in
Robertson
,
as
well
as
the
constitutional decision and the
alcohol-related cases
submitted
by defendant, I found
myself
unable to take
judicial
notice
of
any
degree
of
impairment
being
proven
by
comparing
the
BDC
level to the legal limits set by
Parliament.
[
38
]
The Crown characterized this as
the drawing of a reasonable inference, as opposed to taking judicial notice. If
that characterization is a correct one, as opposed to taking judicial notice, I
find the inference the Crown sought drawn to be speculative and insufficiently
supported by evidence.
[
39
]
Further, I found the accident and
the defendant’s physical appearance both to be easily
explicable
–
indeed,
probably
explicable
–
by
a
medical
crisis
and
more
specifically by the defendant’s seizures.
The Crown fairly acknowledged in her submissions that a medical
crisis
was
a
reasonable,
alternate
inference
that
could
be
drawn
on
this
evidence about the accident and I agree
with that position.
[
40
]
The evidence when considered as a
whole fell short of the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and as a
result, the defendant must be acquitted of the single count before the court.
