Tomovski J.:
I.          INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
The Applicant’s trial has yet to occur.  It is
scheduled for December 9 and 10, 2025, nearly 23 months after the Applicant’s
arrest.  However, this will be the third time a trial date has been set for
this relatively straightforward “domestic” assault case involving one alleged
victim.  Third time’s not the charm, according to the Applicant.  As such, he
brings an application pursuant to s. 11(b) of the
Charter
alleging that
his right to be tried within a reasonable time has been violated and seeks a
stay of the proceedings as a remedy.  This application arises from the failure
of the trial to proceed on the first two scheduled dates.  The Applicant and
the Crown disagree on who is ultimately responsible for the delay in reaching
the currently scheduled trial date.
[
2
]
The Applicant argues that delayed core disclosure
at the beginning of the prosecution caused significant delays in the completion
of the case irrespective of the reasons for the adjournment of the first two
trial dates.  Conversely, the Crown argues that once core disclosure was made,
the Applicant’s actions led to an adjournment of the first two trial dates due
to a scheduling error and the Applicant’s unavailability on multiple earlier
dates and is therefore responsible for the delay that followed.
[
3
]
For my reasons that follow, I dismiss the
application.  I find that once defence delay is deducted from the total delay,
the net delay is significantly below the presumptive ceiling established by the
Supreme Court in
R. v. Jordan
,
2016 SCC 27
and by any reasonable
assessment is the delay in the Applicant’s case unreasonable. The Applicant’s unavailability
for multiple earlier trial dates offered by the court and available to the Crown
coupled with the Applicant’s error in scheduling the second trial date when the
Applicant was already booked were the main causes of the bulk of the delay in
the Applicant’s case.
II.         BACKGROUND
[
4
]
The Applicant is charged with three counts of
assault against the alleged victim.  The incident dates are April 9, December
29, 2023, and January 12, 2024.  The Applicant was arrested on January 13,
2024.
[
5
]
The Information was sworn on January 22, 2024.  The
anticipated end of trial is December 10, 2025, the second day of a two-day
trial.  As a result, the overall delay is 688 days or 22 months and 18 days,
which is over the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling for unreasonable delay of 18
months for a trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, when the Crown has elected
to proceed summarily, which it has in this case.
[
6
]
For the sake of analytical convenience, the
history of the proceedings in this case can be somewhat neatly divided into two
phases, as will become apparent in these reasons: the disclosure phase and the
trial-setting phase.
[
7
]
Starting with the disclosure phase, the applicable
period is from the date the Information was sworn (January 22, 2024) and the date
the Applicant finally received the alleged victim’s statement to police (August
20, 2024), a period of 211 days.
[
8
]
Both the Crown and the Applicant agree that this
entire period is appropriately viewed as non-defence delay; specifically, Crown
delay based on the Crown’s (and police’s) failure to provide core disclosure (the
alleged victim’s statement to police), disclosure necessary for the Applicant to
be able to meaningfully assess the case against him and to allow him to move
his case forward to the trial-scheduling phase.
[
9
]
The disclosure phase consisted of several court
appearances in the administrative remand court, which included numerous efforts
on the part of the Applicant to obtain the core disclosure.  Those dates are January
26, March 1, April 12, May 24, July 5 and August 9, 2024.
[
10
]
Before moving on from this period, I wish to
address what I find is far too common an approach by the Crown that contributes
to a culture of complacency that must change to ensure the re-occurrence of this
type of delay is prevented.  The Supreme Court in
Jordan
at paras.
4, 29
and 40
referenced a culture of complacency and a tolerance for excessive delay
and identified insufficient practices as one contributing factor to that
culture. That recognition was nearly 10 years ago.  Neither in its written
materials on this application nor during its oral submissions did the Crown
provide an explanation, or satisfactorily attempt to provide one, for why it
took nearly seven months for the Applicant to be provided a copy of the alleged
victim’s statement to police, despite numerous requests by the Applicant for
it.  The statement was recorded on video and obtained prior to the Applicant’s
arrest. Many justice system participants – including the accused, the alleged
victim, and the public – deserve and should expect the Crown to seek out an
answer to avoid re-occurrence of this kind in future cases.  This approach
would align with the framework’s prospective approach in taking proactive
measures to remedy delay:
Jordan
at para.
108
.  While I may not be the
first to raise these concerns, as a justice system participant, I share in the
responsibility of helping to resolve an apparent Crown and police indifference
to remedying the repeated failure to provide timely core disclosure: see
R.
v. Scott-Wolf
,
2024 ONCJ 502
at paras.
57-59
;
R. v. Stefan
, v.
2024
ONCJ 565
at para.

;
R. v. Smith
,
2023 ONCJ 222
at para.

; and
R.
v. Hotaki
,
2023 ONCJ 261
at paras.
29-33
.
[
11
]
Turning now to the trial-setting phase, it is at
this stage that the Crown and Applicant diverge in their views regarding
responsibility for significant portions of the delay in scheduling the trial in
this case.  As such, I will outline this phase in greater detail than I did
when discussing the disclosure phase.
[
12
]
Once the Applicant received the alleged victim’s
statement, both the Crown and the Applicant agree that the latter was able to
take the necessary steps to set a trial date.
[
13
]
At the August 9, 2024, court appearance, the Crown
advised the Applicant that the alleged victim’s statement was just received and
would need to be vetted and would be disclosed to the Applicant right after. 
As referenced above, the statement was eventually disclosed on August 20, 2024.
Additionally at the August 9 court appearance, based on the Applicant’s ongoing
concerns regarding delay in obtaining outstanding core disclosure, the Crown
and the court encouraged the Applicant to take the necessary steps to secure a
trial date in advance of the return date.  The Applicant sought and was granted
an adjournment of six weeks to September 20, 2024, for that purpose.
[
14
]
On September 20, 2024, agent for the Applicant’s
counsel appeared and indicated that he “was supposed to set trial dates” but
was unable to due to personal reasons.  The agent sought and was granted an
adjournment to obtain trial dates.  At the agent’s request, the case was
adjourned to October 11, 2024.
[
15
]
It was not, however, until October 1, 2024, that
the Applicant booked a trial scheduling meeting with the trial coordinator,
which was for the following day, October 2.
[
16
]
At the October 2 trial scheduling meeting, a
2-day trial was secured for September 25 and 26, 2025, which is 20 months from
the date the Information was sworn.  However, as the trial scheduling form shows,
the court offered 21 earlier dates for a 2-day trial – October 17-18, 29-30, 2024,
June 4-5, July 2-3, 7-8, 9-10, 15-17, 23-25, 28-30, July 30 and August 1,
11-13, 18-20, 20-21, 26-27, 28-29, September 2-3, 8-9, 15-16, 17-18, 22-23,
24-25, 2025 – all of which the Applicant was unavailable.  Of those dates, the Crown
was available for 17 of them, starting with June 4-5, 2025, which is approximately
16.5 months from the date the Information was sworn.
[
17
]
The Applicant, at the time of the trial
scheduling meeting, noted his intention to bring a s. 11(b)
Charter
application and secured a date of April 11, 2025, to have the application
heard.  The hearing did not proceed on that date.
[
18
]
As part of the court’s effort to reduce the
backlog of cases in the region at that time, the Applicant’s case was one of
many cases brought forward from their respective trial dates to offer earlier
trial dates which had become available because of the recent appointment of several
new judges.  This appearance occurred on January 8, 2025. An earlier 2-day
trial of April 7 and 8, 2025 was secured, which is 14.5 months from the date
the Information was sworn.  Despite the overall delay being reduced by 2 months
due to the backlog initiative, the Applicant, once again, noted his intention
to bring a s. 11(b)
Charter
application and secured a hearing date of March
7, 2025.
[
19
]
As occurred at the original trial scheduling
meeting, at the January 8, 2025, backlog initiative court appearance, the court
offered earlier dates for a 2-day trial, this time 5 earlier dates were offered
– February 12-13, 20-21, 24-25, 26-27 and March 24-25, 2025 – all of which the
Applicant was, once again, unavailable.  Of those dates, the Crown was
available for all but one of them, February 12-13, which is approximately 12.5
months from the date the Information was sworn.  The Applicant, regardless, confirmed
he would still be bringing a s. 11(b)
Charter
application.  Of note,
because April 7 and 8, 2025, were secured as the trial dates, none of the
parties, understandably, canvassed to see what trial dates, if any, were
available beyond then.  In hindsight, as will become clear below, it would have
been a useful exercise.
[
20
]
On March 5, 2025, the Applicant brought the case
forward to seek an adjournment of the April 7 and 8, 2025 trial dates due to a scheduling
error on the part of the Applicant in setting the trial dates when he was
already booked on an unrelated matter.  No explanation, however, was offered by
the Applicant in his written application or in his oral submissions to explain when
the Applicant first discovered he was not available for the April 7 and 8 trial
dates and why the application was not brought sooner than March 5.  The
adjournment was granted.  A second trial scheduling meeting was held on March 7
to choose a new trial date.  This period from when the trial date was set in
error and the second trial scheduling meeting was held, January 8 and March 7,
2024, respectively, is 59 days.
[
21
]
In seeking an adjournment of the trial and for
the reason referenced above, which the Applicant accepted as his “fault”, he,
however, did not expressly waive his s. 11(b)
Charter
rights including
any ensuing delay caused by the adjournment of the trial.  However, in
considering the request and, ultimately, granting the adjournment, the
presiding Justice put to the Applicant that adjourning the trial “might effect
your 11(b)”, to which the Applicant responded, “it will, absolutely”.
[
22
]
After the adjournment was granted at the March 5
court appearance, the case was adjourned to March 21, 2025, to allow the
Applicant to book the second trial scheduling meeting with the trial
coordinator to secure new trial dates.  That meeting, as referenced above, was
held on March 7.  The current trial dates of December 9 and 10, 2025 were
secured.  Only one earlier date approximately 1.5 months away was offered by
the court, April 23-24, 2025, which was available to the Applicant but not to the
Crown.
[
23
]
At the March 7 trial scheduling meeting, a date
for this application was secured for August 13, 2025.  The application
proceeded before me as scheduled.  I reserved my reasons to October 20, 2025.
III.        ANALYSIS
a.
The
Jordan
Framework
[
24
]
The Supreme Court in
Jordan
outlined the
framework by which delay is to be assessed under s. 11(b) of the
Charter
. 
The framework as it applies to the Ontario Court of Justice is summarized as
follows.
[
25
]
There is a presumptive ceiling of 18 months:
Jordan
at paras.
5, 46, 49, and 105
.  Delay above that mark is presumptively
unreasonable, whereas delay below it is presumptively reasonable:
Jordan
at paras.
47-48, 68, 82 and 105
.
[
26
]
Delay is considered and calculated in different
ways at different stages of the framework.  At the outset, the total delay must
be calculated.  This period is calculated from the date of the charge to the
end of the trial:
Jordan
at para.
60
.  The former equates with the date
the Information is sworn: see
R. v. Allison
,
2022 ONCA 329
at paras.
35-43
;
R. v. Kalanj
,
1989 CanLII 63 (SCC)
.
[
27
]
Defence delay is subtracted from the total
delay:
Jordan
at paras.
49, 60, and 66
.
[
28
]
Defence delay can result from an explicit or
implicit waiver or delay caused solely or directly by the defence’s conduct:
Jordan
at paras.
61, 63 and 66
.  An example of the latter is when the Crown and court
are ready to proceed but the defence is not:
Jordan
at para.
64
. 
However, legitimate defence conduct is not defence delay:
Jordan
at
para.
65
.
[
29
]
When the delay is above the presumptive ceiling,
the onus is on the Crown to establish the presence of exceptional circumstances
that justify the delay:
Jordan
at paras.
47, 68, 81 and 105
. 
Exceptional circumstances are circumstances that are reasonably unforeseen or
reasonably unavoidable and the ensuing delay emanating from those circumstances
cannot reasonably be remedied by the Crown:
Jordan
at para.
69
.  The Crown
must show that it took reasonable steps to avoid the delay before the
presumptive ceiling was surpassed:
Jordan
at para.
70
.  Those steps need
not be successful in preventing the delay:
Jordan
at para.
70
.
[
30
]
Generally, exceptional circumstances fall into
two groups: discrete events or particularly complex cases:
Jordan
at
para.
71
.  The former includes medical emergencies or unexpected illnesses,
whereas the latter includes cases with novel or complicated legal issues, voluminous
disclosure or many witnesses requiring a lengthy trial:
Jordan
at paras.
77-78
.
[
31
]
Like defence delay, delay caused by exceptional
circumstances is subtracted from the total delay:
Jordan
at para.
75
.
[
32
]
When the delay is below the presumptive ceiling,
the onus is on the Applicant to show that the delay is otherwise unreasonable
by establishing that it “took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
effort to expedite the proceedings” and the case took “markedly longer than it
reasonably should have”:
Jordan
at paras.
48, 82 and 105
.
[
33
]
Meaningful and sustained steps include seeking
and setting the earliest available trial dates and giving notice when delay is
becoming a problem:
Jordan
at para.
85
.
[
34
]
Whether a case took markedly longer considers
multiple factors including the case’s complexity, local considerations, and
whether the Crown took reasonable steps to expedite the proceedings:
Jordan
at para.
87
.
[
35
]
Stays beneath the presumptive ceiling will be
granted only in clear cases:
Jordan
at para.
83
.
b.
The
Hanan
principle
[
36
]
In
R. v. Hanan
,
2023 SCC 12
at para.
9
, the
Supreme Court rejected a bright-line rule of attributing the entirety of
ensuing delay to the defence after the rejection of an initial date because of
unavailability.  Instead, a contextual analysis was emphasized in which all
relevant circumstances are to be considered to determine if and how the ensuing
delay should be apportioned.
[
37
]
In
R. v. Jones
,
2025 ONCA 103
at para.
32
,
the Court of Appeal noted that
Hanan
did not “adopt an inverse
bright-line rule apportioning the defence with none of the delay”.  The Court at
para. 33 reiterated that all relevant circumstances must be assessed to decide
how to apportion the delay among the parties: see also
R. v. Jacques-Taylor
,
2024 ONCA 458
at paras.
5-7
;
R. v. Shaporov
,
2025 ONCA 281
at para.
33
.
[
38
]
In
R. v. K.D.
,
2025 ONCA 639
, the Court
of Appeal further clarified the principle in
Hanan
.  The Court at para.
46 noted, “it is not that the apportionment of delay is warranted in every
case, but rather that the circumstances of every case must be considered to
determine whether apportionment is warranted”.
[
39
]
In
R. v. Bowen-Wright
,
2024 ONSC 293
at
paras.
38-48
, the summary conviction appeal court identified several factors that
would inform any contextual analysis in the apportionment of ensuing delay
after the rejection of an initial date.  Those factors include the reason for
the need to reschedule and whether it was caused by the defence; the extent to
which the defence was available; and the reasons for the defence unavailability.
c.
Jordan
and
Hanan
Applied
[
40
]
The total delay in the Applicant’s case is from
January 22, 2024 (the date the Information was sworn) to December 10, 2025 (the
anticipated end of trial).  The total delay is 688 days or 22 months and 18
days.
[
41
]
As referenced earlier in these reasons, the Crown
inevitably conceded it was responsible for all the delay up to the date it
finally provided core disclosure to the Applicant.  I accept the Crown’s
concession and agree that the Crown’s failure to provide the Applicant with the
alleged victim’s video statement to police is entirely Crown delay.  This
period is from January 22, 2024 (the date the Information was sworn) to August
20, 2024 (when the statement was disclosed to the Applicant), a period of 211
days.
[
42
]
I find there is no further Crown delay beyond
August 20, 2024.
[
43
]
There are, however, several periods of defence
delay once the Applicant received the alleged victim’s statement and was able
to proceed, that are to be deducted from the total delay.
[
44
]
The first period of defence delay is from
September 20 to October 2, 2024, a period of 12 days.  This is the period from when
the Applicant had received the alleged victim’s statement (August 20, 2024) and
was ready to set a trial date but returned to court on September 20 having
failed to take the necessary steps to set a trial date, requiring a further
adjournment to October 11.  It was not until October 1 that the Applicant set a
trial scheduling meeting for October 2 and obtained a trial date.
[
45
]
Subtracting 12 days from the total delay of 688
days leaves a net delay of 676 days.
[
46
]
The second period of defence delay is from June
5 to September 26, 2025, a period of 113 days.  This period is in reference to
the scheduling of the first trial date.  Of the dates offered, June 5 was the
first date that the court and Crown were ready to proceed but the Applicant was
not.  The latter was not available until September 25 and 26, 2025, the dates
chosen for trial.  As referenced earlier, the court and Crown were available
for 17 additional interim dates, while the Applicant was not.
[
47
]
Subtracting 113 days from the net delay of 676
days leaves a remaining delay of 563 days.
[
48
]
The third period of defence delay is from February
21 to June 5, 2025, a period of 103 days.  This period is in reference to the
backlog initiative court appearance of January 8, 2025.  At that appearance, the
first trial date of September 25 and 26, 2025, was vacated so that an earlier trial
date could be chosen.  Five earlier dates were offered.  The Crown and court
were ready to proceed starting on February 20-21, 2025.  February 21 is,
therefore, the start of this period of defence delay.  Determining the end of
this period of defence delay requires a more nuanced assessment.  Although an
earlier trial date of April 7 and 8, 2025 was chosen, as it became apparent
later, the Applicant had set this date in error because he was not actually
available, because of a prior commitment.  At the original trial scheduling
meeting of October 2, 2024, when the first trial date of September 25 and 26,
2025 was chosen, the earliest trial dates the Crown and court were available
was June 4 and 5, 2025.
June
5 is, therefore, the end of this period of defence delay.
[
49
]
I do not find it appropriate to apportion any of
the third period of delay to anyone other than the Applicant.  As referenced in
Hanan
, I am required to undertake a contextual analysis of the cause of
the delay resulting from the backlog initiative court appearance.  After having
considered the circumstances including the reasons the first trial date was
vacated – a defence error in booking a date he was not actually available – I
find that none of the delay flowing from the vacated first trial date should
rest with anyone other than the Applicant.  I find the Applicant’s trial should
have taken place no later than June 4 and 5, 2025 and could have taken place as
early as February 20 and 21, 2025.  Regarding the latter, I find the dates
offered were sufficiently far enough away (1.5 months away) from when the
parties appeared on January 8, 2025, to be a reasonable date to offer and
expect the defence to be available.  My view that it is reasonable to find the
defence’s unavailability as the basis for finding this period is defence delay
is reinforced by the fact that three further dates were offered, also unavailable
to the defence, including March 24-25, 2025, approximately 2.5 months away.
[
50
]
Subtracting 103 days from the net delay of 563
days leaves a remaining delay of 460 days.
[
51
]
If I am mistaken in my determination of the start
of this third period of delay, that is, February 21, 2025, or in attributing
the entire period between February 21 and June 5, 2025 as defence delay, I find
that the defence inaction between the setting of the second trial date of April
7 and 8 at the January 8 backlog initiative court appearance, and the
corresponding vacating of the September 25 and 26 trial date at that time, and
the Applicant’s delay in waiting until March 5 to bring an adjournment
application to rectify the scheduling error is defence delay.  As stated in
Jordan
at para.
113
, the defence “cannot benefit from its own delay-causing action or
inaction”.  On January 8, the Applicant attended the backlog initiative court
and inadvertently set the second trial date on dates for which he was already
booked.  It was not, however, until March 5 and 7, 2024, respectively, that the
matter was brought forward to vacate the trial date and a new trial date was
obtained.  The Applicant cannot benefit from either setting the second trial
date in error or from his delay in correcting it.  I find this entire period,
from January 8 to March 7, 2024, a period of 59 days, as defence delay.
[
52
]
However, I do not subtract this period from the net
delay, but it does factor into any below-the-ceiling assessment and my finding
that the Applicant did not take meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
effort to expedite the proceedings once the Applicant received the
complainant’s video statement.  Further, subtracting one but not both of this
period of delay or the third period of delay from the net delay similarly results
in a period of delay well below the presumptive ceiling.
[
53
]
The fourth period of defence delay is from September
26 to December 10, 2025, a period of 75 days.  As instructed by
Hanan
,
in considering all the relevant circumstances and whether to apportion some,
none or all of the ensuing delay to the Applicant for adjourning the trial
date, I find that but for the Applicant’s error in setting the earlier trial
date of April 7 and 8, 2025, for which the Applicant was not actually
available, the original trial dates of September 25 and 26, 2025, would never
have been vacated, obviating the need for the currently scheduled trial dates
of December 9 and 10, 2025.  This is no fault of the Crown or court.  It is
delay entirely caused by the actions of the defence.
[
54
]
I have considered but declined to apportion any
of the delay in setting the current trial date of December 9 and 10, 2025 to
the Crown.  The second trial scheduling meeting was held on March 7, 2025.  The
only interim date offered, which was available to the Applicant but not the Crown,
was April 23-24, 2025.  However, recall that the first trial date of September
25 and 26, 2025, was available to the Crown at the time it was set – in addition
to a significant amount of earlier trial dates – which were not available to
the Applicant.  Even if I were to apportion the entire period from when the Crown
was originally available, September 26, to its revised availability of December
10, a period of 75 days, as my ensuing below-the-ceiling assessment will show,
the applicable net delay could be adjusted and increased by 75 days and still
be well below the presumptive ceiling (15 months).  However, I reiterate that I
decline to apportion any of the fourth period of delay to the Crown based on
the Applicant having solely caused the need for an adjournment of the April 7
and 8 trial date due to an error in scheduling.  In all the circumstances it
would be unreasonable to apportion any delay to the Crown knowing that it was originally
available for several earlier trial dates starting in February followed by
March, June, July, August and September.

Subtracting 75 days from the net delay of 460
days leaves a remaining delay of 385 days or approximately 12.5 months.
[
56
]
The 12.5 months of net delay falls considerably short
of the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling.  In my view, by any reasonable assessment
and application of the
Jordan
framework for below-the-ceiling cases does
the net delay in the Applicant’s case become unreasonable.  Despite this, I
will briefly undertake a below-the-ceiling assessment of the net delay.
[
57
]
Aside from the very low numeric value itself, there
are several factors which lead me to find that the delay in the Applicant’s
case is reasonable.  They are as follows.
[
58
]
The Applicant failed to take meaningful and sustained
steps.
[
59
]
First, the Applicant did not set the earliest
available trial dates.  When the first trial date was set, the Applicant was
unavailable for 17 earlier dates that were offered by the court and available
to the Crown.  Similarly, when the second trial date was set, the Applicant was
unavailable for 4 earlier dates that were offered by the court and available to
the Crown.
[
60
]
Second, the Applicant waited approximately two
months to bring an adjournment application to vacate the trial dates that were
set in error and obtain new trial dates.
[
61
]
The case did not take markedly longer than it
reasonably should have.
[
62
]
First, the Crown took reasonable steps to
expedite the proceedings.  The first two times the Applicant’s case was ready
to be set down for trial (October 2, 2024, and January 8, 2025), the Crown and
court offered several earlier dates, all which were under the presumptive
ceiling.  Additionally, after the first trial date of September 25 and 26, 2025
had been set on October 2, 2024, the Crown and court acted quickly in
earmarking the Applicant’s case for the backlog initiative court and secured a
date of January 8, 2025, to offer earlier trial dates.
[
63
]
Second, regarding local considerations, a trial within
12.5 months in this, and likely, any jurisdiction, is reasonable.  In Peel region,
recent similar cases to the Applicant’s with a net delay in the range of 14-16
months have been found to be reasonable: see, for example,
R. v. Richards
,
2024 ONCJ 7
(15.5 months);
R. v. Kullab
,
2023 ONCJ 458
(15.5 months);
Scott-Wolf
,
supra (14.8 months delay);
R. v. Mikovic,
2024 ONCJ 106
(14.6 months).  Conversely,
I am unable to locate a single recently reported decision in this jurisdiction
in which a case with a net delay of 12.5 months resulted in a stay being
granted.  Even if one did exist, the circumstances of the Applicant’s case and
the reasons for the delay do not satisfy me that the delay is unreasonable.
[
64
]
Before concluding, I will address one of the
cases relied on by the Applicant in this application:
R. v. A.(C.)
,
2024
ONSC 1603
.  Both
A.(C.)
and the Applicant’s case involved significant
delay at the outset of the prosecution in obtaining core disclosure.  However,
the similarities end there.  There were determinative facts in
A.(C.)
, not
present in the Applicant’s case, which justified a stay of proceedings.  These
facts include: no defence delay (para. 115); the net delay exceeded the presumptive
ceiling (para. 39); an alternative analysis placing the adjusted net delay at 17
months (paras. 44-45); new trial dates offered were never more than 33 days away
(paras. 2, 8-11; 26-31, 35); and the Crown’s attempt to secure an earlier trial
date began too late – 14.5 months after the charge (paras. 8, 34, 111, 114).
V.        CONCLUSION
[
65
]
The net delay of 12.5 months is well below the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling.  The Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption and
show that the delay is otherwise unreasonable.
[
66
]
The application is dismissed.
