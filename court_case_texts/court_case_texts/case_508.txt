Introduction
A.
Introduction
[
1
]
The
defendant is charged with impaired operation and refusing to provide a breath
sample arising out of a police investigation on May 7, 2023.  On Friday
December 20
th
, 2024, I provided a brief oral decision in court
because I was in the middle of another trial.  I indicated that I would provide
a written judgment forthwith sourced from my draft oral judgment. Court did not
sit from December 23
rd
, 2024, to January 1
st
, 2025.  On
January 2
nd
, 2025, I filed this written judgment with the Clerk of
the Court and distributed electronic copies to counsel.
[
2
]
The
defendant, as the applicant brought a
Charter
application alleging a
breach of ss. 8,9,10(a) and 10(b) of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(
Charter
)
.
The applicant submits that given
the neglectful conduct of the police, this court should exclude all
evidence obtained from the applicant including his refusal, statements,
utterances, actions, and observations of him pursuant to
s.24(2)
of the
Charter
.
[
3
]
The parties requested a blended application and trial.  The
defendant testified on the application only.  There was no Defence evidence presented
at trial.
[
4
]
At the
submission stage the challenge to reasonable grounds for the arrest (
ss. 8
and
9
Charter
breach) was abandoned.
The application also alleged
that the police breached the defendant’s
ss. 10(a)
and
10(b)
Charter
rights
by failing to recognize “special circumstances” around the defendant’s use of
the Mandarin language.
[
5
]
The applicant submits that the police should have recognized that a
significant language barrier existed.  The applicant submits that the police
should have engaged translation services for the applicant given the
circumstances.  The applicant also submits that the negligent behaviour of the
police bled into the deficient approach to facilitating rights to counsel.  The
applicant submits that the defendant should have been connected with Mandarin language
translation services for the provision of rights to counsel and a Mandarin-speaking
lawyer.
[
6
]
The respondent Crown submits that there were no “special
circumstances” extant.  Alternatively, the respondent submits that the police
action was responsive to the circumstances and no
Charter
breach
occurred.
[
7
]
For the reasons that follow, the
Charter
application
is dismissed.  Even if I have erred in the analysis of the alleged breaches, I
would not exclude the evidence under
s.24(2)
of the
Charter
.
[
8
]
I make the following specific findings that I will explain
further and expand upon in this written judgment.
[
9
]
First, notwithstanding the respondent’s position, I find that
the applicant is correct.  I find that “special circumstances” did in fact exist.
[
10
]
Second
,while “special circumstances” did exist, I find that the police were attentive
and responsive to the issue.  It is significant that within two minutes of his
arrest at 22:57 HRS, the police asked the applicant if he wished to communicate
in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English.  The applicant told the police he preferred
English.
[
11
]
Finally,
I reject the applicant’s testimonial assertion that he did not understand the
interaction with the police throughout because of a language barrier.  I do not
believe the applicant’s evidence that language issues impaired his
understanding of the breath sample demand, his interaction with legal counsel;
or his understanding of the events in the breath room.  I make the credibility
finding that the defendant was wilfully and deliberately obstructive in the
breath room.
[
12
]
As
it concerns the trial, for the reasons that follow, I am satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt as it concerns each count. The
defendant is found guilty of both counts before the court.
II.
The
Charter
Application
A.
Onus – ss. 10(a) and
10(b) of the
Charter
[
13
]
The Crown Attorney and Defence counsel
jointly requested that the court approve a blended application and trial. 
Notwithstanding this common request, it is imperative that the court vigilantly
observe the various onuses on the application, and the ultimate burden of
proof:
R. v. Boston
,
2013 ONCA 498
, at paras.
23-27
.
[
14
]
The defendant as the applicant must
establish any alleged breach of
ss.10(a)
and
10(b)
of the
Charter
on a
balance of probabilities.  The onus of establishing the
s.24(2)
remedy lies on
the applicant as well.
[
15
]
In this case it is also important to
emphasize that the defendant elected to provide evidence on the application
only.  The defendant did not testify on the trial proper.
B.
Credibility
on the
Charter
Application
[
16
]
For
reasons that will become apparent during this judgment, I did not find the
applicant to be a credible witness on central issues relevant to the
Charter
.
As such, it is important to note the approach to credibility on a
Charter
application.
[
17
]
A
Charter
application is not a trial.  With respect to the assessment
of
credibility
issues on the
Charter
application, the principles pronounced
in
W.(D). v. The Queen
, (1991), 63
C.C.C. (3d) 77 (S.C.C.) do not apply. The guilt or innocence of the
applicant is not being determined, and the criminal standard of proof does not
apply: (See the reasoning in
F.H. v. McDoug

2008

[
18
]
The
evidentiary record produced by the applicant must persuade me on a balance of
probabilities that his version of the events are to be preferred. Simple
preference of the applicant's evidence is sufficient to sustain his assertions.
C.
The Alleged Breaches
of the
Charter
[
19
]
At
its core, the evidentiary record produced by the applicant must persuade me on
a balance of probabilities that “special circumstances” existed.  The applicant
must also persuade me that the police conduct, in light of the “special
circumstances” breached his
Charter
rights.
[
20
]
Having
regard to the record,  and the submissions of Defence counsel, I may identify,
extrapolate, and summarize the following core alleged breaches:
1.
The police should have afforded the applicant
access to language-translation services at the scene;
2.
The police should have used language-translation services to
provide rights to counsel at the scene and at the police station;
3.
The police should have used language-translation services to articulate
the breath demand at the scene and at the police station (breath room);
4.
Notwithstanding the fact that when asked as to whether the
applicant preference Cantonese, Mandarin, or English,  the applicant indicated
he preferred English, it was incumbent upon the police to revisit the issue;  and,
5.
Given the deficient approach of the police as it concerned the
informational component of s.10(a), the applicant did not fully understand his s.10(b)
rights and therefore could not exercise them.
[
21
]
The
resolution of the
Charter
application depends, in part, on my assessment
of the credibility and reliability of all of the witnesses on the application. 
But before addressing credibility and my factual findings, I will set out the
other necessary consideration – the notion of “special circumstances”.
D.
Foundational
Principles
[
22
]
In
a recent decision called
R. v. Vertentes-Arruda
,
2023 ONSC 6770
, J.
Stribopoulos J. set out the relevant foundational principles when considering
s.10(a)
and
s.10(b)
of the
Charter
(at paragraphs  219 to 223):
219
In
Bartle
, the Supreme Court of Canada concisely
summarized the duties
section 10(b)
of the
Charter
imposes upon the police when they detain or arrest an
individual, which include:
(1)to inform the detainee of
his or her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay and of the
existence and availability of legal aid and duty counsel;
(2)if a detainee has indicated
a desire to exercise this right, to provide the detainee with a reasonable
opportunity to exercise the right (except in urgent and dangerous
circumstances); and
(3)to refrain from eliciting
evidence from the detainee until he or she has had that reasonable opportunity
(again, except in cases of urgency or danger).

, at para.

,
[2014] 2 S.C.R.
495
, at para.
23
.
220
The
first duty is informational. The second and third duties are implementational
and only triggered if the detainee invokes their right by asking to speak with
a lawyer: see
Bartle
,
at para.
17
;
R. v. Sinclair
,
2010 SCC 35
,
[2010] 2 S.C.R. 310
, at
para.
27
.
221
The
informational duty obligates the police to advise the individual "about
Legal Aid and duty counsel services which are in existence and available in the
jurisdiction at the time," which "need consist of no more than
telling a detainee in plain language" of the existence of the "phone
number" by which they may "contact a lawyer right away":
Bartle
, at para.
28
.
222
Also,
as part of their informational duty, when a person under detention or arrest is
advised of their right to counsel and indicates that they do not understand, or
it is apparent that they do not, the police must take further steps to
facilitate their understanding: see
R.
v. Willier
,

223
In
circumstances where language difficulties are the apparent cause of an
individual's inability to understand, the police's informational duties under section
10(b) include facilitating a translation of the required information into the
language the person understands: see
R.
v. Tam
(1995),

[
23
]
In
five paragraphs J. Stribopoulos J. efficiently set out the appropriate bedrock
principles upon which the sa.10(a) and 10(b) analysis should rest.
E.
“Special
Circumstances” Existed
[
24
]
The
respondent simply submits that  “special circumstances” did not arise in this
case.  While there are many informative decisions
addressing “special circumstances”, my conception of the concept is informed by
several legal authorities:
R.  v. Vanstaceghem
,

, [1987] O.J. No. 509 (C.A.),

2011 ONSC 4342
, at paras. 28-33;
R. v. Silva
,
2015 ONCJ 2
, at para.
11
.  In
particular, I found the  persuasive and thorough
guidance provided by
R. v. Ukumu
,
2019 ONSC 3731
, at paras.
32-35
to be
helpful.
[
25
]
Synthesizing
these guiding authorities, I easily arrive at the finding that there existed special
circumstances  based on an evaluation of both objective criteria and subjective
criteria.  I find that the applicant has demonstrated that special
circumstances existed.
[
26
]
First,
I accept the
viva voce
evidence of the applicant on the application that
English is not his first language.
[
27
]
Second,
I accept the applicant’s subjective evidence that his comprehension was
impacted to a degree by language comprehension issues.
[
28
]
Third,
I accept the evidence of each police witness called on the application in the
sense that both the arresting officer and the qualified breath technician (QBT)
responded to the applicant’s presentation by adapting to facilitate language
comprehension.
[
29
]
Fourth,
the objective evidence in the case supports the finding.  I have observed the
applicant on body-worn-camera footage (BWC) at the scene, the booking video,
and the breath room video.  I can see how the applicant presented to the police
officers and gauge their response.  In this vein, and with the assistance of
the authorities noted above, the following findings are clear:
•
English is not the applicant’s first language
•
The applicant has a discernable accent
•
The applicant was not born in Canada
•
Simple language was utilized by the police
•
The applicant communicated in “broken” English
omitting words
•
The applicant responded with brief mono-syllabic
answers at times
•
At times the applicant expressed confusion or a lack of
comprehension
•
The police officers felt the need to speak
slowly and explain things in simpler terms
[
30
]
I
find that this record clearly demonstrates that special circumstances existed. 
I now turn to the central question – the adequacy of the police response.
F.
“Special
Circumstances”:  The Police Response
[
31
]
Notwithstanding
the existence of special circumstances,  the police did not breach
ss.10(a)
or
s.10(b)
of the
Charter
.
I arrive at this finding for several reasons.
[
32
]
First,
the arresting officer was alive to the issue of language comprehension almost
upon immediate contact with the applicant in front of his residence.  Within
two minutes, the applicant was explicitly asked if he wished to communicate
with the police in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin.  The applicant clearly and
unequivocally told the police that he preferred English.
[
33
]
The
applicant testified on the application that he answered in this way because he held
the subjective belief that the police query limited him to Canada’s two official
languages.  He did not speak French.  So, he chose English.   I do not believe the
applicant’s testimony in this regard.  The applicant did not express this state
of mind at the roadside.  He did not seek any clarification from the police
officers.  He did not express anything in support of the view that his choice
was limited to French or English.  The applicant was clearly and specifically told
that he could communicate in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English.  This necessarily
communicated to the applicant that his choice was not limited to French or
English.  In my view the police offer of communication in Cantonese, or the
Mandarin language was an appropriate and reasonable response to the
presentation of the applicant.
[
34
]
Second,
the applicant answered several questions posed by the police and complied with
their direction throughout the evening.  This commenced at the scene, continued
during booking, and continued in the breath room, notwithstanding the ultimate refusal
to provide a breath sample.  For example, at the scene he complied with
document requests and directions around the arrest.  At booking he answered all
of the questions posed by the officer in charge.  In the breath room he also
complied with English language direction provide by the QBT  (e.g., stand up,
face the wall).
[
35
]
Third,
the applicant spoke to the arresting officer about the accident.  He conveyed
that he had signaled the movement of his vehicle.  He told the police he did
not understand why they were interacting with him (i.e., he was not at fault). 
While the organization of his communication was not perfect, I also recognize
that the applicant was speaking to two police officers and was clearly
flustered by the police involvement.  It is not unusual for persons to exhibit such
a reaction to a police investigation.  I must also frankly observe that the applicant’s
speech was garbled and slurred when he spoke with the police in front of his
residence.  These features were not present when I heard him testify in court.
[
36
]
Fourth,
the applicant testified that he did not understand why the police were
investigating him “at first”.  But he then “knew a bit” why they were there.  He
also testified that he was “aware of something but was just guessing”.  During
further cross-examination the defendant was confronted with the fact that he
had handed his insurance card to the complainant driver.  Further, the Crown
Attorney put to the applicant that he clearly knew that he had been in an
accident and that is why the police attended.  The applicant reluctantly
acknowledged that the police asked about drinking and he understood.  On three
occasions it was put to the applicant that he understood the simple fact that: (1)
he had been in an accident; (2) that drinking and driving was the issue; and
(3) that he was being arrested because of this sequence of events.  Despite
acknowledging these components of the evidence, the applicant refused to
acknowledge his comprehension of these factors.
[
37
]
I
don’t believe the applicant’s testimony on these points.  I did not find his
testimony to be honest or truthful in this regard.  I found that the
cross-examination exposed that he did in fact understand why he was being
investigated by the police.
[
38
]
While I accept that the applicant could have been a bit
confused in the aftermath of the accident – this could be the state of mind of
anyone involved in a motor vehicle accident.  Further, the complainant driver described
the applicant as “not all there”.  I also recognize that confusion may be a
product of alcohol consumption.  But in any event the  complainant driver testified
that the applicant asked him if he had hit him a few times.  When the
complainant driver explained to the applicant that he had in fact rear-ended
his vehicle, it took some time for the applicant to process this information. 
But immediately after, the applicant responded with “I pay you! I pay you”. 
And invited him to his house.
[
39
]
Clearly
the applicant was aware of the accident approximately twenty minutes prior to
the attendance of the police on his driveway.  I don’t believe the applicant’s
testimony that he was confused about the attendance of the police.  I prefer
the evidence of the complainant driver.  The applicant knew precisely why the
police arrived to speak with him.  He was not straightforward about this when
he testified on the application.
[
40
]
Fifth,
the arresting officer testified that notwithstanding the applicant’s position
that he preferred English, she recognized that the administration of rights to
counsel required slower speed, simpler terms, and a more nuanced approach.  In
my review of the BWC footage the arresting officer did in fact adopt this
approach.
[
41
]
The
arresting officer testified that the applicant answered in broken English at
times, and at other times did not . She was aware that there was a language
barrier as it concerned specific words.  This is why she responded by
simplifying her language and going slowly notwithstanding the applicant’s
preference for English.    I found this approach to be reasonable given the
circumstances.
[
42
]
I
should note that I do not accept the arresting officer’s testimony that she addressed
language issues a second time at the roadside before lodging the applicant in
the police cruiser.   This was not captured on her BWC footage or the footage
in the police cruiser.  But I assessed this as a reliability rather than
credibility strike against her evidence.  There is no question that PC Morris
was attuned to language issues and took great care to tailor her approach given
the circumstances.
[
43
]
Sixth,
the applicant’s credibility is further impacted by his testimonial claim that
he did not hear the police offer him the choice of English, Mandarin, or
Cantonese.  This position is completely disingenuous.  As evidenced by the BWC
evidence the applicant clearly heard this offer and clearly responded that he
preferred English.  In a note of comedic relief, the second officer at the scene,
an officer who also spoke in heavily accented English, quipped that he “preferred
English” too.  Further, this testimony conflicted with the applicant’s other
testimony that he believed that he only had a choice between English or French
language.  In this other area of testimony, the applicant clearly acknowledged
having heard the offer of English, Mandarin, or Cantonese.
[
44
]
Seventh,
the arresting officer stood side-by-side with the applicant at the front of the
police cruiser and addressed the informational component by running her finger
along the words of the rights to counsel as she read them from the back of her
notebook.  The applicant stood right next to her closely observing.
[
45
]
Eighth,
during cross-examination the applicant agreed that he understood the words
“free” and “lawyer”, yet he claimed not to understand  “you can call free
lawyer”.  The applicant was unable to articulate why he did not understand
those simple words.
[
46
]
Ninth,
the applicant also clearly understood the question when he told the arresting
officer that he did not have his own private lawyer to call.  Ultimately, when
pressed on this point, the applicant simply said that the arresting officer
never informed him of this information.  Clearly the applicant is an unreliable
historian because it is right there on the BWC.  I accept the arresting
officer’s testimony on this point.  I don’t believe the applicant’s testimony
that he did not understand that he could speak to a free lawyer by telephone.
[
47
]
Tenth,
while the defendant testified on the application that he did not have full
comprehension of English writing, he did not express any concern on this issue
at the time as evidenced by the BWC evidence. In addition, the core information
was conveyed in simple and clear terms in my review of the BWC footage played
at trial.
[
48
]
Eleventh,
during cross-examination on the application, the applicant testified for the
first time that he had impaired vision, and this affected his ability to follow
the printed word on the arresting officer’s notebook.  This evidence was not
stated during direct examination.  It evolved under pressure during
cross-examination.  It demonstrated to the Court that the applicant was adept
at creating new explanations or excuses when under pressure.  I did not believe
his testimony in this regard.
[
49
]
Twelfth,
the arresting officer told the applicant that he could speak to counsel at the
police station in any language.  The applicant responded that he spoke good
English. The arresting officer also told the applicant that when they arrived
at the police station, she could ask for an language interpreter if needed.
While this offer did not absolve the police of their continual duty to ensure
that rights to counsel was understood, the applicant made no such request.
[
50
]
Thirteenth,
the applicant spoke to duty counsel from 0006 to 0019 HRS.  When he completed
the call, he made no complaint about the advice he received. He made no
requests.  He did not convey anything to suggest he did not understand the
lawyer.  He did not indicate any dissatisfaction with the legal advice.  There
was nothing that would have provoked a responsibility on the police to re-engage
on the issue of interpretation.
[
51
]
The
applicant testified during the application that he did not understand duty
counsel on the night in question.  He did not understand what the purpose of
the conversation was.  During cross-examination the applicant conceded that he
did not raise any language issue with the duty counsel.
[
52
]
The
applicant did not adduce any evidence from the duty counsel lawyer he spoke to
that night.  I am generally aware that the identity of duty counsel contacted
from the police station is routinely available, so I infer that this
information was available to the applicant at trial.
[
53
]
Defence
counsel have a heavy obligation when providing legal advice to clients.  Were
it the case that duty counsel was told by the applicant that he could not
understand English or that he required an interpreter, I may infer that duty
counsel would have taken steps to assist.  For example, in several other cases duty
counsel contacted the police station to request an interpreter on behalf of the
client or to facilitate the provision of legal advice.  In my experience this
is not an everyday occurrence, but it is also not an unusual occurrence.  It is
notable in this case that there is no record from duty counsel documenting a
language issue on the part of the applicant.
[
54
]
Finally,
when the QBT was presented with the applicant’s refusal to provide a breath
sample, in addition to giving the applicant over twenty opportunities to blow,
he also used a language application on his iPhone issued by the Toronto Police
Service to communicate the directions he had provided in English.  While it was
suggested during cross-examination that the QBT had no way of knowing if the
Mandarin language was being translated properly, he indicated he would not
expect the Toronto Police Service to provide access to a malfunctioning
interpretation application.  Furthermore, during cross-examination of the
applicant, he conceded he understood the Mandarin language provided by the
application.
G.
Conclusion – Applicant's Credibility
[
55
]
In
the final analysis, the other significant factor on the application concerned
the credibility of the applicant.  I generally did not believe his testimony claiming
a lack of comprehension of the interaction at the roadside, the communication
of rights to counsel, the breath demand, or the instructions provided by the QBT.
[
56
]
While
it is clear that English is not the applicant’s first language, he, like many
in our diverse society, possessed a sufficient understanding of English to
communicate with the police.  He has been in Canada for twenty-six years.  He
has lived in both Toronto and Alberta.  He worked in a commercial retail
setting.  I am satisfied that he understood the interaction with the police.
[
57
]
The
applicant was specifically offered interpretive assistance.  He clearly and
specifically told the police that he preferred English.  In this multicultural
city of diverse persons and a multitude of accents and inflections in spoken
English, the police were not required to act paternalistically, override his
decision, and provide interpretative assistance notwithstanding the applicant’s
express statement.  On the record adduced on this application, the applicant was
given the option and preferred English. The police approach was accessible to
me thanks to the BWC evidence and the video evidence at the police station.   I
find that the police reasonably adapted their approach to the applicant’s
presentation and express choice.
[
58
]
I
should be clear that I am not prepared to find that once a detainee choses
English there is no going back.  Certainly, there may well be circumstances
where notwithstanding the detainee’s expressed preference, subsequent dealings
communicate to the police that they need to re-canvass interpretive
assistance.  But on a review of the entire record in this case, I find that the
circumstances did not require the police to re-canvass the issue.  I find that
the police reasonably adapted their approach given the issue of language.  And
I don't believe the defendant’s testimony that he lacked comprehension.
[
59
]
In
conclusion, I generally reject the applicant’s claim that he did not understand
the circumstances of the evening, his rights to counsel, or the breath demand. 
The applicant has been in Canada for 26 years.  While I generally accept that
he frequents Chinese grocery stores and services, and interacts on a daily
basis in Mandarin, he sought to overemphasize his reliance on Mandarin and
underemphasize his ability in English when he testified about the events.  While
there is no doubt that the applicant speaks English as a second language, I do
not believe his assertion that his English comprehension is as poor as he would
have me believe.
[
60
]
The
applicant’s credibility was significantly impacted by his testimony on the application
suggesting that he did not understand virtually anything that occurred that
night.  The applicant refused to accept that he understood that the police were
investigating the accident despite reluctantly acknowledging that he had been
in an accident, provided his insurance card to the other driver, and he was
aware that it was wrong to “drink and drive”.  Three times he endorsed and
underlying understanding of these themes yet claimed not to understand what was
happening.
[
61
]
In
a similar vein, the applicant understood the words “lawyer”, “free” and “phone
call” in English yet he did not understand that the arresting officer was
offering him access to telephone a free lawyer.
[
62
]
The
applicant’s credibility was also significantly impacted by his testimony that
he did not hear the police offer him the choice of English, Cantonese, or
Mandarin language assistance.  The BWC evidence belies this testimonial
position.  Clearly the applicant heard the police. Clearly the applicant made a
choice.  It also conflicts with his testimony on the application where he
claimed to believe that he was limited to either of the two official languages
in Canada.  He also acknowledged during cross-examination that he did in fact
hear the male police officer ask him if he spoke Cantonese or Mandarin.  Within
the four corners of the applicant’s testimony, he was inconsistent on this
point.
[
63
]
In
my view, the police response to the applicant’s presentation was reasonable and
did not violate the
Charter
.
The applicant has not established a
breach of the
Charter
on a balance of probabilities
H.
Remedy - 24(2)
[
64
]
Notwithstanding
my finding that there was no breach, I will very briefly address
s.24(2)
of the
Charter
in case I have erred.
[
65
]
The
applicant bears the onus on a balance of probabilities to establish the
requested remedy of the exclusion of evidence.  The applicant has not
demonstrated that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute.
[
66
]
Under
s.24(2) of the
Charter
this court must assess the impact on society’s
confidence in the justice system, having regard to the three factors set out in
R. v. Grant,
2009 SCC 32
.
1.
Seriousness
of the
Charter
-infringing State Conduct
[
67
]
Frankly,
the arresting officer in this case demonstrated keen attention to the issue of
language comprehension.  The police canvassed the issue with the applicant. 
They followed his choice.  Even in following his choice, the police still took
the extra steps set out above to facilitate comprehension.  The applicant did
in fact speak with a lawyer for a significant period of time.  He was offered
an interpreter.  He was offered language translations services in Cantonese or
Mandarin.  The QBT used an app to communicate.  Given all of the steps taken by
the officers, if I was to find a breach, it would have to be low on the
spectrum akin to understandable or blameless.  This branch of the analysis
favours admission.
2.
Impact on
the Applicants
Charter
-protected Interests
[
68
]
Were
it the case that a breach occurred, I would characterize the impact on the applicant’s
interests as significant.  It would mean that the applicant did not understand
the arrest, rights to counsel, and the breath demand.
3.
Society's
Interest in an Adjudication of the Case
[
69
]
Society
is keenly interested in the adjudication of drinking and driving offences on
their merits.  This factor favours inclusion of the evidence.
4.
Balancing
[
70
]
The
purpose of s. 24(2) is to maintain the good repute of the administration
of justice including maintaining the rule of law and upholding
Charter
rights.
[
71
]
The
focus is on the long-term confidence of the public in the justice system, not
the immediate result in the instant case. An informed reasonable person would
be concerned that the police facilitate interpretive assistance to a member of
our community.  I believe that an informed reasonable person would respond
positively to the approach of the officers as outlined in this judgment.
[
72
]
Balancing
the three Grant factors the sound conclusion is inclusion of the
evidence:

III.
Trial – Impaired Operation
A.
Introduction
[
73
]
Defence
counsel submits that the Crown has not proven the impaired count beyond a
reasonable doubt.  The central submission is that the identification of the
driver of the defendant’s vehicle has not been proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.
[
74
]
For
the reasons that follow, I find that the prosecution has proven this count
beyond a reasonable doubt.
B.
Analysis
1.
The
Burden of Proof and General Criminal Law Framework
[
75
]
Criminal
trials are informed by a number of well-known legal principles. I will briefly
set out the framework for the proper approach to the analysis of the evidence.
[
76
]
The
central tenet in our criminal justice system is the constitutional entrenchment
of the presumption of innocence.  A criminal defendant begins a trial with the
presumption of innocence.  The defendant is not required to testify.  The
defendant is not required to present any evidence. The presumption does not
shift during the trial. The presumption of innocence is only dislodged if the
prosecution presents evidence establishing the defendant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt:
R. v. Lifchus
,
1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)
, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at para.
27
;
R.
v. Starr
,
2000 SCC 40
, at para.
242
.
2.
Reasonable
Doubt
[
77
]
The reasonable doubt standard applies to the final determination of
guilt or innocence. It is not applied piecemeal to individual pieces of
evidence or categories of evidence:
R. v. Menard
,
1998 CanLII 790 (SCC)
, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109;
R.
v. Morin
,
1988 CanLII 8 (SCC)
, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.
[
78
]
Reasonable
doubt is based on “reason and common sense”, is not “imaginary or frivolous”,
does not “involve proof to an absolute certainty”, and must be “logically
connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.”:
R. v. Villaroman
,
2016 SCC 33
, at paras.
28
,36 [
Villaroman
].
[
79
]
It
is important to note that the Defence bears no burden to prove foundational
facts in support of an inference of innocence:
Villaroman
, at para.
35
;
R.
v. Khela
,
2009 SCC 4
.  Nor is the defendant  required to adduce evidence
providing foundational support for a “finding” of reasonable doubt:
Villaroman
,
at para.
28
.  A defendant is free to point to anything in support of reasonable
doubt including the presence or absence of evidence.
3.
Identification
Issue
[
80
]
The
central issue on the impaired count is identification.  Considering the  core
Defence submissions on this issue I extrapolate the following challenges to the
identification record:
1.
While it is acknowledged that the defendant’s vehicle was being
operated, ownership of the vehicle does not mandate the conclusion that the
defendant himself was operating the vehicle particularly when he lived in a
residence with roommates;
2.
The prosecution has not proven that it was the defendant who
operated the vehicle at the time of the collision as opposed to another elderly
Asian male;
3.
The complainant driver was not asked to identify the person
operating the defendant’s vehicle nor did the complainant driver follow the defendant’s
vehicle to the defendant’s address down the street;
4.
The complainant driver did not witness the police arresting the
person who had operated the defendant’s vehicle;
5.
The keys to the defendant’s vehicle were not found on his person;
and,
6.
The second crown witness’ identification of a Asian male associated
to the defendant’s vehicle was not linked to the person identified at the
accident scene by the complainant driver.
[
81
]
At
the outset, I must stipulate that the Crown did not seek the substantive
admission of any statements made by the defendant to the police – before or
after rights to counsel.  As such, none of the statements made by the defendant
to the police are admissible at trial.
[
82
]
In
a similar vein, the defendant testified only on the
Charter
application. 
As such, that record is not receivable against the defendant at trial.
[
83
]
Having
self instructed on the criminal burden of proof, reasonable doubt, and the
guidance of
Villaroman
, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the defendant is the person who was operating his vehicle at the time of the
collision.  There are several reasons for this finding.
[
84
]
First, 
the complainant driver testified that there was no one else in the defendant’s vehicle
(although he did not check the rear seats of the vehicle).  He spoke with the
driver who was behind the wheel of the other car after the collision.  He did
not “seem like he was all there”.  Throughout the record adduced at trial there
was no evidence of any other person within the defendant’s vehicle.
[
85
]
Second, while the application record contained a reference to a
roommate or some other inhabitant of the defendant’s residence, this evidence
was not adduced at trial.  While the video shows the police interacting with
someone I am not able to see who that person is or what they look like.  As
such, it would be rank speculation to find that that person must be an older
Asian male resembling the defendant.
[
86
]
Third,
I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was in fact the defendant who
interacted with the complainant driver at the accident scene.  The person who
rear-ended the complainant driver asked the complainant driver if he had hit
the complainant’s vehicle.  This person also told the complainant driver “I pay
you!” “I pay you!”  This person also asked the complainant driver to home to
his house.
[
87
]
Fourth,
while waiting the police to arrive the person who operated the defendant’s
vehicle left the scene.  The complainant driver watched the
person drive down a nearby street.  He drove on the left side of the road into
oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the road and tried to park his car in a
driveway four or five times.  The complainant observed this occurring
approximately ten to fifteen houses down the street from where he was located. 
 I find that given the descriptions provided by
the two civilian witnesses and the arresting officer, this was the defendant’s
residence.
[
88
]
Fifth,
the elderly male Asian person who interacted with the complainant driver at the
accident scene provided an expired insurance slip in the name of the defendant.
This was conveyed by the complainant driver to the police when they attended.
[
89
]
Sixth,
the complainant driver’s evidence is corroborated by the second crown witness –
his spouse.  The complainants spouse attended the scene when advised of the
collision. I find that she observed the same vehicle described by the complainant
driver.  At this moment the van began to leave the scene of the collision.  The
complainant driver’s spouse followed the van down the street to a residence. 
The vehicle was being operated erratically -- slowly and then fast.  The
vehicle was not being driven in its lane of proper travel.  This witness watched
him try to reverse into the driveway approximately 10 to 15 times to get into
the driveway.  When the vehicle was finally in the driveway, she told the
person who was operating the vehicle that he left the scene of the accident and
the police were on their way.
[
90
]
Seventh, the complainant driver took a picture of the licence plate
of the car who struck him before he left and conveyed the Alberta licence plate
to the police when they arrived.  The arresting officer noted an Alberta
licence plate on the vehicle parked in the driveway where they had contact with
the defendant.
[
91
]
Eighth,
the complainant driver described the driver wearing a puffy jacket.  The
defendant was wearing the puffy jacket when the police contacted him in front
of his residence.
[
92
]
In
conclusion, it is not lost on me that the complainant driver and his spouse
provided a rather generic identification at trial – an older Asian gentleman in
his sixties.  There is no evidence that either witness was shown a
photo-lineup.  There is no evidence that either witness was present when the police
arrested the defendant.  Neither witness identified the defendant in court.  I
have turned my mind to the possibility that the elderly male who provided the
expired insurance document to the complainant driver was not the defendant.  I
also engage the mandatory caution that all criminal justice system participants
must acknowledge as it concerns the frailties of eyewitness evidence.
[
93
]
I
have considered the submission of Defence counsel that it is possible that
another elderly male Asian person was using the defendant’s vehicle. Having
regard to the criminal burden of proof and the guidance of
Villaroman
, I
find the notion to be speculative.
[
94
]
Again,
it is important to note that I do not have any evidence from the defendant on
the trial proper.  Nor do I have any concrete evidence about who else was present
at the residence.  While the BWC evidence allows me to conclude that there was
a person at the door of the residence, the camera angle does not allow me to
see the person.  I do not know who they are.  I do not know if they reside with
the defendant.  I do not have any evidence as to that person or any other
person’s access to the defendant’s vehicle.
[
95
]
On
this record I find that the prosecution has proven that it was the defendant
who was operating his vehicle at the time of the collision.  In my view I am
entitled to use my common sense and experience to draw the reasonable inference
that that person was the defendant.  I recognize that
Villaroman
does
not require the prosecution to negative every possible conjecture.
4.
Jurisdiction
[
96
]
Notwithstanding
Defence counsel’s focus on identification, I have a responsibility to evaluate
the prosecution case and determine if the prosecution has addressed all of the
essential elements of the offence.
[
97
]
I
do not recall hearing evidence formally establishing jurisdiction (i.e.,
Toronto, Ontario was not explicitly addressed).  But I have heard about
Pharmacy Avenue and “Corinthian”, 54 division TPS, 41 division TPS, and
reference to a nearby subway.  I am satisfied that this incident occurred
within the city of Toronto.  I may have resort to judicial notice as it
concerns the particulars of a local community I know very well.
5.
Impairment
of Ability to Operate
[
98
]
As
it concerns the record in support of the assertion that the defendant’s ability
to operate a vehicle was impaired to any degree by the consumption of alcohol,
I am satisfied that the Crown has proven this beyond a reasonable doubt.  
having regard to: (1) the unexplained accident; (2) no evidence of the use of a
horn or evidence of braking or tires squealing prior to the collision; (2) the
movements of the vehicle on Corinthian Blvd into the oncoming lane; (3) the
erratic movements of the vehicle as it moved down Corinthian Blvd; (4) the
movements of the vehicle demonstrating several attempts to back into the
driveway; (5) the physical observations of the person driving the defendant’s
van as provided by the second civilian witness; and (6) the odour of alcohol
described by the arresting officer.
[1]
[
99
]
The
complainant driver’s spouse testified that the person operating the defendant’s
vehicle was sluggish and unsteady on his feet.  She also testified that the person
was bracing himself on the door, lost his footing while getting out of the
vehicle, and tipped to the side a bit as he got out.
[
100
]
The
arresting officer arrived at the scene at 22:47 HRS and looked for a Dodge
Caravan with Alberta plates as described by the complainant driver.
[
101
]
The
arresting officer smelled the odour of alcohol as she walked around the
vehicle. The arresting officer interacted with the defendant who was sitting on
his front porch.  When she spoke to the defendant she smelled an odour of
alcohol emanating from his person from a distance.  The QBT noted the “overpowering”
odour of alcohol coming from the defendant’s breath in the breathroom.
[
102
]
The prosecution
has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s ability to operate
his vehicle was impaired, to any degree, by his consumption of alcohol.
[
103
]
The defendant is found guilty of this count.
IV.
Trial – Refuse
A.
Introduction
[
104
]
The
Defence position is that the adduced on the blended application and trial
demonstrates that language-related issues impaired the defendant’s
comprehension of the demand and his functional ability to provide a sample of
breath.  The Defence position is that the breathroom evidence demonstrates the
defendant’s good faith efforts to provide a sample.  These efforts were
hindered by the police failure to provide translation services.  Had the
defendant been provided with such assistance he would have clearly understood
the breath demand and the instructions provided by the QBT.
[
105
]
Notwithstanding
my ruling on the
Charter
application, the language issue is still
available to the defendant at trial.  As the prosecution bears the criminal
burden of proof as it concerns the
actus reus
and
mens rea
for
the offence.
[
106
]
The
Ontario Court of Appeal recently restated the elements of the offence in
R.
v. Khandakar
,
2024 ONCA 620
, at paragraphs
17 to 19
:
17
Section 320.15(1)
of the
Criminal
Code
states:
320.15(1) Everyone commits an offence who, knowing that a demand has been
made, fails or refuses to comply, without reasonable excuse, with a demand made
under section 320.27 or 320.28.
18
To establish
the
actus reus
of the offence, the
Crown must prove that the police made a lawful demand under either s. 320.27 or
320.28, and that the accused either "fail[ed]" or
"refus[ed]" to comply. In cases involving the refusal branch of the
offence, the accused must be proved to have refused "unequivocally":
R. v. Degiorgio,
2011 ONCA 527
,
275 C.C.C. (3d) 1
, at para.
42
.
4
19
There is
disagreement in the case law about the mental elements of the refusal offence:
specifically, over whether the Crown must prove that the accused intentionally
failed or refused to provide a breath sample, or whether it is enough for the
Crown to prove that the accused knew that their conduct would have this result:
see e.g.,
R. v. Porter,
2012 ONSC 3504
;
R. v. Lewko,
2002 SKCA 121
,
169 C.C.C. (3d) 359
;
R. v. Soucy,
2014 ONCJ 497
,
316 C.C.C. (3d) 153
;
R. v. Slater,
2016 ONSC 2161
,
94 M.V.R. (6th) 224
;
R. v. Mtonga,
2021 ONSC 1482
.
[
107
]
The
analysis requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances between
the defendant and the police.  I adopt the approach outlined by I.V.B.
Nordheimer J. in
R. v. Slater
,
2016 ONSC 2161
, at paragraphs
9 to 12
:
9
The central point made in
Porter
is that, if the evidence
led by the Crown establishes that the accused did not provide a proper breath
sample, and the accused knows that s/he has not provided a proper breath
sample, then, absent other circumstances being present that might explain that
failure, the inescapable inference is that the accused intended to cause that
result. This point is made in
Porter
where Code J. said, at para. 35:
In the
Lewko
and
Sullivan
line of cases, the
accused all knew that they were failing to provide a suitable sample. Indeed,
there had been repeated failed attempts with no suggestion that the accused was
unaware of the failures.
In other words, it could be inferred that the
accused had a general or basic intent in relation to the prohibited act
.
[emphasis in original]
10
In fact, this is the same approach to the issue of proof
of intent that was utilized in
Lewko
. In that decision, Bayda C.J.S said, at para. 31:
The inexorable, indeed, the
only inference one can draw from these two facts in light of there being no
other explanation, is that the pathetic quality of the attempts was produced by
the respondent's choosing to produce that quality.
In other words, the
inexorable inference is that the respondent intended to produce a failure to
provide an adequate sample
. [emphasis in original]
11
It is also the approach that was implicitly used
in
R. v. Sullivan
,
[2001] O.J. No. 2799 (O.C.J.)
, the other main case
referred to in
Porter
.
In that case, the trial judge had to respond to the Crown's concerns that
requiring it to positively prove intent would place an impossible burden on the
prosecution. It is clear that the trial judge felt that the natural inference
that arises would be sufficient to meet the prosecution's burden of proof,
absent some other evidence being led by the accused to raise a doubt about it.
As Duncan J. said, at para. 13:
As a matter of law, the
accused has the burden of raising sufficient evidence to lend an air of reality
to the issue. Further, as a practical matter, in this situation, that evidence
will have to be fairly cogent.
12
The decision in
Sullivan
is consistent with what I say is the proper reading of
both
Lewko
and
Porter
and, that is, that, absent
evidence to the contrary, or evidence that raises a reasonable doubt, proof of
the requisite
mens rea
for
the offence will be met by the application of the general principle that a
person, who does something that has predictable consequences, usually intends
or means to cause those consequences. Put more directly, evidence that a person
who tries multiple times to provide a breath sample, and in each instance fails
to provide a sample, gives rise to an inescapable inference that s/he is
intending that result, absent some other evidence being present that would
suggest an absence of such an intent, or at least raise a reasonable doubt
about it.

The
defendant did not testify on the trial proper.  As such, his
viva voce
evidence adduced on the application is not admissible at trial.  The record is
limited to the testimony of the QBT and the breath room video exhibit.
[
109
]
The
essential elements of this offence consist of a lawful demand and a refusal or
failure to comply with the demand.  The prosecution has proven that the
arresting officer and the QBT each made a lawful demand for a sample of
breath.
[
110
]
As
for the failure to comply, the defendant was provided with more than twenty
opportunities to provide a breath sample.  As I will outline below, this record
addresses the
actus reus
.
[
111
]
As it
concerns the mental intent, there was no outright refusal in this case.  As
such, the entirety of the defendant’s interaction with the police must be
assessed.
[
112
]
Notwithstanding
the persuasive advocacy of Defence counsel, the prosecution has established
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Put another way, with due consideration of
Slater,
Lewko
, and
Porter
, there is no “evidence to the contrary” or
evidence that raises a reasonable doubt as to the
mens rea
.
[
113
]
There
are two central reasons for this finding.  First, is the testimony and opinion of
the QBT.  Second, my findings sourced in the video of the breath room.
B.
The QBT’s Opinion
[
114
]
The QBT
testified that initially he was concerned that the defendant’s inability was
due to alcohol consumption and a language barrier.  But from approximately
12:40 AM to 01:21 AM the defendant was given over twenty chances to provide a
breath sample.  The mechanics of blowing into the instrument were clearly
articulated to the defendant on numerous occasions.  Ultimately the QBT
testified in support of his subjective opinion that the defendant was
obstructing the process.  That the defendant’s failure to provide a breath
sample was wilful and deliberate.    In arriving at that opinion, he testified about
the conduct of the defendant in the breath room and the numerous ways the
defendant wilfully failed to provide a proper sample of breath.
[
115
]
The QBT
explained the simple basic requirements of a successful breath test on several occasions. 
The QBT demonstrated how to provide a successful breath several times.  The QBT
also used a language application on his TPS issued cellphone to communicate the
simple instructions to the defendant in Mandarin.  The defendant was given several
“last chances” to provide a sample.  The QBT properly permitted additional
“chances”.   Still the defendant did not comply.
[
116
]
I
accept the QBT’s opinion that the defendant’s failure to provide a sample was
deliberate.
C.
The Breath Room Video
[
117
]
Separate
and apart from the subjective opinion of the QBT, the prosecution adduced into
evidence a video of the breath room.  This video clear and objectively shows
the complete interaction between the defendant and the QBT.
[
118
]
The
defendant persistently engaged in manifest obstructive behaviour when asked to
provide a breath sample.  For example, he would not sustain a tone consistent
with the exhalation of breath for more than a few seconds (e.g., 00:58 HRS). 
On other occasions he alternated sucking and blowing (e.g., 01:04 or 0:1:16 
HRS).  At 00:48 HRS the defendant was not even exhaling on the mouthpiece by
itself.  At 00:50 HRS the defendant would start and then immediately stop
blowing.  At times one could even see the defendant’s cheeks hollow as he
sucked rather than blew through the instrument.  The defendant cycled through
these behaviours on each successive opportunity to provide a sample.
[
119
]
A
judge is allowed to use common sense and experience when assessing evidence. 
Having had exposure to hundreds of breath room videos, in my view, the
defendant’s performance on the breath room video manifestly evidenced his wilful
and deliberate obstruction of the breath sample process.  Frankly, the breath
room video evidence depicts one of the clearest cases of refusal I have
witnessed.  The defendant was given over twenty opportunities to provide a
sample.  So many chances that the instrument even timed out and had to be
reinitiated.
[
120
]
The
defendant is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the benefit of any
reasonable doubt . If there was even the slightest thought in my mind that the
defendant’s performance was caused by a language barrier, I would acquit him notwithstanding
my finding on the
Charter
application.  As set out above, the language
issue is available as a trial issue even though I have dismissed the
Charter
application.   But in my opinion, the video evidence manifestly demonstrates
that the defendant’s failure was wilful and deliberate.  This obstructive
behaviour persisted even after the use of the Mandarin translation
application.  The defendant’s failure was not because of language comprehension
issues.
[

The
defendant is found guilty of refuse breath sample.
