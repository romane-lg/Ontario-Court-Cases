SENTENCING DECISION
ASSIÉ J.:
[
1
]
Mr. Lane pleaded guilty to one count of
possession of child pornography. This is my decision on his sentence.
Facts
[
2
]
On October 11, 2024, Mr. Lane, a US citizen, was
travelling from Toronto back to Philadelphia
via
Pearson International
Airport. US Customs Border Patrol (CBP) performed a pre-clearance check on Mr.
Lane. CBP began examining Mr. Lane’s cellphone because they received
information that he might be in possession of child pornography. CBP located
child pornography. They immediately had Peel Regional Police take over the
investigation. Mr. Lane’s cellphone and a micro-SD memory card were seized and
examined.
[
3
]
Police found numerous chat messages on the
Telegram platform that demonstrated Mr. Lane was active in the child
pornography subculture. The messages showed the defendant requested, offered to
trade, and discussed child sexual abuse material with others.
[
4
]
Police also located 3,324 images and 65 videos
of child pornography in Mr. Lane’s possession. His collection featured children
ranging from 3-16 years of age, with most of the content consisting of
prepubescent children. There was a wide range of sexual acts depicted in the
images, including some content that was as highly intrusive and depraved. The
collection includes images depicting:
1)
sexualized posing of young children with no sexual activity
2)
sexual activity between children
3)
solo masturbation by children
4)
non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children
5)
penetrative sexual activity between children and adults
6)
sadism – bondage
7)
bestiality
[
5
]
The Crown filed a representative sample of the
images, videos, and chats, which the Court reviewed in preparation for the
sentencing proceedings.
[
6
]
The chats demonstrated that Mr. Lane sought out
and traded child abuse materials with other people within the subculture. The
chats also demonstrated that Mr. Lane wrote stories about child abuse and
shared them with others. His chats included lurid and realistic stories of
himself having sex with children. The Crown was unable to prove that any of Mr.
Lane’s stories were true, nor am I to consider those stories as evidence of
actual assaults committed by him.
The Purposes
and Principles of Sentencing
[
7
]
Sentencing is a personalized process that takes into account the
seriousness of the crime, the responsibility of the offender, and the damage
caused. The fundamental purposes of sentencing are set out in
section 718
of
the
Criminal Code
,
namely to contribute, along with crime prevention
initiatives, to the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful
and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the
following objectives:
(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;
(b) to deter the offender and other
persons from committing offences;
(c) to separate offenders from
society, where necessary;
(d) to assist in rehabilitating
offenders;
(e) to provide reparations for harm
done to victims or to the community; and
(f) to promote a sense of
responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims
and to the community.
[
8
]
A central principle in sentencing is proportionality: the
sentence must match the seriousness of the crime and the offender’s degree of
responsibility.
[1]
While it must be strong enough to denounce the conduct, it cannot go beyond
what is fair given the offender’s blameworthiness.
[2]
A fair sentence balances both
aspects of proportionality, without emphasizing one over the other.
[3]
The importance of
each sentencing goal varies depending on the crime and the circumstances of the
offender, and there is no exact calculation for what makes a sentence just.
[4]
[
9
]
Parity gives meaning to proportionality. Parity means that
offenders who commit similar crimes, under similar circumstances, should
receive similar sentences. It is rooted in fairness and equality before the
law, ensuring that sentencing does not become arbitrary or wildly inconsistent.
[5]
[
10
]
It is important for the court to identify the appropriate range
of sentences based on statute and caselaw. Ranges reflect judicial experience.
Given the unique ways in which offences can be committed and unique
circumstances of offenders, judges may deviate from established sentencing
ranges where appropriate.
[6]
[
11
]
The court must identify the aggravating and mitigating features
present in the matter before it, which includes the circumstances of the
offender. An aggravating feature is one that is not inherent to the crime
itself. As the Court of Appeal said in
R. v. V.(M.)
,
“It is helpful to
think of the material aggravating factors as those that increase the gravity of
the offence relative to other offences of the same kind, or that increase the
degree of responsibility of the offender, relative to other offenders
committing the same kind of offence.”
[7]
Sentencing for
Possession of Child Pornography
[
12
]
It is helpful for the court to begin by identifying which of the
specific sentencing goals are paramount based on the offence and the offender.
Appellate courts have repeatedly stated that denunciation and deterrence are
the paramount sentencing objectives for offences involving child pornography.
[8]
This is consistent
with s. 718.01
Cr. C.,
which provides:
When a court imposes a sentence for
an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years,
it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and
deterrence of such conduct.
[
13
]
This is also consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in
Friesen
,
where the Court stated that sentences for sexual offences committed against
children must increase in order to denounce the wrongfulness of such conduct
and to recognize the serious harm they cause.
[9]
[
14
]
Regarding child pornography offences, harm may
be either potential or actual. Potential harm involves the reasonably
predictable consequences of the crime, while actual harm must be proven and may
aggravate the seriousness of the offence.
[10]
[
15
]
Possessing
[11]
or accessing
[12]
child pornography are hybrid offences. When prosecuted by indictment, as is the
case here, the maximum sentence is 10 years. Making
[13]
or
distributing/making available
[14]
child pornography are straight indictable offences with a maximum sentence of
14 years. It is evident Parliament intended for those who create or distribute
child abuse material to be punished more severely. Given that the offences can
be committed in different ways, it is unsurprising that the mandatory minimum
sentences have been declared unconstitutional.
[15]
[
16
]
The Internet has transformed the world of child
pornography for the worse. Perpetrators can “produce, distribute, and acquire
child pornography more quickly and easily, and with much less risk of
detection.”
[16]
In an attempt to reaffirm that possession of child abuse materials is not a
victimless crime, the Ontario Court of Appeal in
Pike
articulated the
various harms possession of child abuse material causes. Those include:
1)
People who possess child pornography violate children’s dignity.
Child pornography featuring real children cannot come into existence without
the abuse of a real child. Possession of child pornography violates the rights
of children not to have permanent records of their abuse used by adults for
their pleasure.
[17]
2)
People who possess child pornography directly invade children’s
privacy.
[18]
3)
People who possess child pornography inflict severe emotional harm
on children and continue their violation. They are effectively parties to the
initial abuse by continuing it through the consumption of the material. They
contribute to the powerlessness felt by victims who know they are unable to
remove the recording of their abuse from the Internet.
[19]
4)
People who possess child pornography create a market for the
material and incentivise the future abuse of children.
[20]
5)
Possessing and watching child abuse material can also incite
perpetrators to commit and facilitate other sexual offences against children.
It leads to denying and minimizing the wrongfulness of abuse which leads to
facilitating the commission of other sexual offences against children.
[21]
6)
People who possess child pornography undermine children’s equality
and humanity – it renders them mere objects for the sexual appetites of adults.
[22]
[
17
]
The Court’s central goals in
Pike
were to
reaffirm that possession is a
grave offence
, that possession continues
the children’s abuse depicted in the material, that possession itself
constitutes child sexual abuse, and that possession creates a demand for
further sexual abuse.
[23]
[
18
]
In
Pike
, the Court reviewed a
non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors relevant when sentencing people who
possess child pornography. The aggravating factors include:
1)
the size of the collection
2)
videos versus still images
3)
the level of organization of the collection
4)
the level of physical intrusiveness of the activity depicted
5)
the existence of violence beyond that inherent in the sexual
offences
6)
the age of the children
7)
whether it involves real children versus stories or virtual images
and videos
8)
the duration of involvement with the material
9)
frequency of downloading and viewing
10)
degree of collaboration with other offenders
11)
participation in the child pornography subculture
12)
the existence of a criminal record
13)
production and distribution
14)
payment for materials
15)
the perpetrator’s risk to children

Sentencing
Ranges for Possession
[
19
]
The following is a review of relevant sentencing
decisions by the Ontario Court of Appeal.
[
20
]
In
R. v.
Inksetter
, a 51-year-old
first time offender pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and
distribution.
[25]
The accused was in possession of 1.2 million images and 40,000 videos, which
the police analyzed. They gave up analyzing the material seized after having found
28,052 unique images and 1,144 unique videos. Of the material analyzed, 95
percent of the material depicted actual penetration and other sexual activity.
Some of the material involved children as young as one. Other images involved
bondage and bestiality. The material was meticulously organized. He pleaded
guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. The trial judge sentenced him to 2
years less one day. The Court of Appeal substituted a 3.5-year sentence for
distribution and 3 years for possession (concurrent).
[
21
]
In
R. v. Walker
, the offender was
convicted of three offences: accessing, possessing, and distributing child
pornography.
[26]
The materials in question involved prepubescent children, including toddlers.
The offender was found to have made these materials widely accessible through a
peer-to-peer file-sharing network. The Court of Appeal upheld a three-year
sentence.
[
22
]
In
R. v. Olivetti
, the accused pleaded
guilty to one count of possession and one count of accessing child pornography.
[27]
He had 11,000 images and 88 videos (primarily depicting prepubescent girls).
The accused was 77 years old and had a prior criminal record for which he had
been sentenced to 10.5 years for numerous historical sexual offences involving
children. The judge acceded to the joint position for 4 years. The Court of
Appeal upheld the sentence.
[
23
]
In
R. v. Brown
, the accused was convicted
after trial of accessing, possessing, and making available child pornography.
[28]
He was found guilty in relation to 500 files. The files contained both images
and videos and, for the most part, involved children 10 years old and younger.
Many of the files were characterized as "severe", meaning they
depicted sexual violence against children. Some showed children exposing and
touching their genitals or performing sex acts on themselves. Some showed sex
acts between adults and children, and between children. He was sentenced to 3
years by the trial judge, which  was upheld on appeal.
[
24
]
In
R. v. McCaw
, the accused pleaded
guilty to one count of possession of child pornography.
[29]
He was a repeat
offender who had committed the same offence in 2002 and had received a
conditional sentence. In 2011 he had been convicted of possession and
distribution and received a sentence of 2 years less a day. He was 46 years old
at the time of sentencing and was accessing child pornography daily. The
accused had uploaded videos of children between the age of 1 and 12 engaging in
sexual acts with adults and other children. Police found seven unique images
and three unique videos in his possession. The trial judge gave him a
conditional sentence. The Court of Appeal substituted a 3-year sentence.
[
25
]
In
R. v. Rule
, the defendant was a
70-year-old retired schoolteacher.
[30]
He had a vast collection. He had more than 22,429 images and 204 videos.
Approximately two thirds of the material focused on children’s genitals with
the last third showing children engaged in graphic sexual activity including
vaginal and anal penetration. The offender had been viewing the images since he
was 60 years old. There was no evidence he produced or distributed any of the
material. The Court of Appeal upheld a 22-month custodial sentence.
[
26
]
In
R. v. V.(M.)
, the accused pleaded
guilty during the same proceeding to charges contained in two distinct
informations.
[31]
The first information related to sexual interference charges and the second
related to child luring and child pornography charges. The judge imposed an
8-year global sentence, even though the parties suggested a joint position of 1
year for the sexual interference, leaving open the child luring charge. The
Court of Appeal overturned the decision and substituted a 5.5-year global
sentence – 1 year for the sexual interference, 3.5 years for the child luring,
and 1 year for the child pornography offences. The accused had close to 500
images, and 213 videos with a total run time of almost 18 hours. He shared some
of his child pornography with others.
[
27
]
In
R. v. Covil
, the accused pleaded
guilty to breaching a s. 161
Cr. C
. prohibition order, mischief, and
obstructing a peace officer.
[32]
He was found guilty after trial of distribution of child pornography. The
police had found one image and four videos on the defendant’s cell phone. The
trial judge sentenced him to 6 years. The Court of Appeal reduced the sentence
to 5 years.
[
28
]
In
R. v. Parker
, the accused was found
guilty after trial of making available child pornography, possession, failing
to comply with a probation order and breaching a prohibition order.
[33]
The trial judge sentenced him to 8 years – a significant jump from his prior
sentence of 2 years and 8 months for similar offences in similar circumstances.
The police found 356 images and 30 videos containing child pornography. Police
also uncovered communications involving Mr. Parker and two other individuals,
which pertained to the exchange of child abuse material. In one instance, Mr.
Parker transmitted hyperlinks to images and videos to a recipient who had
expressed an interest in obtaining child sexual abuse material. In another
instance, Mr. Parker engaged in a conversation with an individual who
identified herself as a 10-year-old girl. He inquired whether she was familiar
with pornography, to which she responded, “what’s porn?” Mr. Parker then sent
an image depicting adult sexual content, followed by an image showing an adult
male performing a sexual act on a toddler, along with additional explicit and
threatening messages. At the time of the offence he was under a prohibition
order precluding him from accessing the Internet and a probation order
prohibiting him from accessing social medial or file sharing networks. At the
time of sentencing he was 30 years old. He had a criminal record dating from
2017 for possessing and making available child pornography.
[
29
]
Notably in
Parker
, the Court stated:
The trial judge
then went on to impose an eight-year sentence for the conviction for making
available child pornography and a six-year sentence for the conviction for
possession of child pornography. In imposing these sentences, it appears that
the trial judge may have been influenced by the numbers referred to in
Friesen
for sexual offences against children. As reviewed above, in
Friesen
, the
Supreme Court was explicitly dealing with sentences for sexual interference and
the listed related offences. In that context, the court clearly stated that
offences involving child pornography are also very serious and that sentencing
for such offences should increase in recognition of the wrongfulness of the
conduct and the serious harm caused to children.
However, the decision
cannot be read as suggesting that sentencing for offences involving the making
available and possession of child pornography should necessarily be in the same
range as sentencing for sexual interference and the other related offences
.
[34]
(emphasis added)
[
30
]
In
Pike
, the accused Scott was found
guilty after trial of possessing 89 images, 57 videos, and approximately 3,000
virtual and story material.
[35]
He had been discovered when he brought the material into Canada from abroad. He
had been consuming the material for three decades. Initially, the trial judge
sentenced him to a 23-month conditional sentence order. The Court of Appeal
substituted a 3-year sentence.
[
31
]
Prior to
Pike
, the upper range was 3.5 to 4 years for
possession of child pornography.
In
Pike
, the Court of Appeal increased
the upper range at 5 years. In explaining the new range, the Court stated:
The increase I set
out is measured and harmonizes with related sentencing ranges.
The upper end
matches the five-year upper end of the range for child luring, which carries
the same maximum sentence as possessing child pornography:
M.V
.
, at
para.
87
.
Further, it respects Parliament's choice to set higher maximum
sentences for contact offences and for the production and distribution of child
pornography than for simple possession because it is lower than the ranges for
those offences:
R. v. Parker
,
2024 ONCA 591
, at paras.
31-32
;
M.V
.,
at paras.
81-82
;
D.G.F
., at para. 29.
[36]
(emphasis
added)
[
32
]
Respectfully, I believe the Court made an
error.  Child luring (s. 172.1
Cr. C.
) has a maximum sentence of 14
years – the same as production and distribution of child pornography – whereas
possession (s. 163.1(4)
Cr. C.
) has a maximum 10-year sentence.
Consequently, the range for possession
cannot
be harmonized with the
range for child luring and must reflect Parliament’s choice of a lower sentence
for those who possess or access child pornography.

Aggravating
and Mitigating Factors
[
34
]
Mr. Lane is 34 years old and an American
citizen. His biological mother was a young woman engaged in prostitution and
heavily addicted to crack cocaine and used substances throughout her pregnancy.
At the age of two, he was removed from his mother’s care and placed in foster
care and group homes, where he remained until the age of six. He was sexually
and physically abused by an older foster sibling to the point of being
hospitalized. He was placed into the care of his current adoptive parents.
However, the abuse continued by another foster child until he was around eleven
or twelve years old when his older adoptive brother learned what was happening
and his adoptive parents were alerted. The offending child was removed from the
home.
[
35
]
Regarding his biological mother, Mr. Lane had
his last contact with her in 2013 after learning she had been diagnosed with
colon cancer. He spent a year living with her and providing care until her
passing in 2014. She had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and experienced frequent
manic episodes. Although it was a difficult time, he expressed appreciation for
the opportunity to reconnect and spend time with her during her final year.
[
36
]
He is single, never married, and has no
children. He was in a committed relationship for three years. They remain good
friends. Prior to his incarceration he was gainfully employed as a senior fleet
safety specialist in the United States. He came to Canada for business purposes
when he was investigated and discovered in possession of the offending
material.
[
37
]
In 2013 he was convicted of impersonating an
officer and threatening and received a 6-month custodial sentence and four
years of probation. In 2015 he was convicted of “criminal trespass/gains entry
by subterfuge” and received three years of probation. Both of those occurred in
the United States
[
38
]
The aggravating factors in this case are as
follows:
1)
The size of the collection. Mr. Lane had 3,324 images, which
constitutes a large collection.
2)
The collection included 65 unique videos, which totaled
approximately 3.5 hours of sexual abuse materials.
3)
The material consisted of real children being abused. This was not
written fiction, AI generated, or adult participants who had images of
children’s faces superimposed.
4)
The nature of the acts depicted including penetrative sexual
activity between children and adults, sadism, and bestiality.
5)
Mr. Lane crossed the border in possession of the material, though he
was not charged with importing materials.
6)
His chats demonstrated that he was an active trader of child abuse
materials and well ensconced in the subculture.
7)
His chats included sexualized stories of having abused children.
Assuming that the stories were mere fantasies and works of fiction, they have
the effect of inciting others by normalizing the abuse of children.
8)
Mr. Lane has an unrelated and somewhat dated criminal record.
[
39
]
The mitigating factors are as follows:
1)
Mr. Lane provided his passwords to his devices and cooperated with
the police during the investigation.
2)
He pleaded guilty. He has been self-represented and attempted to
move his matter expeditiously. He has demonstrated a desire to plead guilty
from an early instance.
3)
Mr. Lane provided letters he’s written to the court. I accept that
his remorse is sincere and that he truly recognizes the harm that he’s
committed. I accept that he has a sincere desire to receive treatment to manage
his deviant sexual desires. He has not minimized what he has done, nor
attempted to justify it.
4)
Mr. Lane’s PSR reveals that he has had a very challenging upbringing.
He’s been the victim of sexual and physical abuse, parental neglect, and grown
up in foster homes and as a ward of the state in the United States.
Position of
the Parties
[
40
]
The Crown seeks a 5-year sentence minus time
spent in pre-sentence custody. The Crown focuses on the aggravating factors of
his participation in the subculture, the fact that he was exchanging material,
and that he crossed the border with the material. They further submit that Mr.
Lane’s guilty plea is worth little given the overwhelming Crown case.
[
41
]
Mr. Lane asks for a 2.5-year sentence minus time
spent in pre-sentence custody.
Pre-Sentence
Custody
[
42
]
Mr. Lane has been in custody since his arrest on
October 12, 2024. He will have spent 11 months in custody by the time he is
sentenced. Credited at 1.5 to 1, he will have spent 16.5 months in pre-sentence
custody. He was housed at Maplehurst and the Toronto South Detention Centre.
Between both institutions, records show he was under lockdown for 73 days and
triple bunked at Maplehurst for 146 days. Mr. Lane kept his own records for the
time he spent under lockdown. His records conflict with those provided by the
institutions.
Conclusion
[
43
]
After careful review of the caselaw and a
consideration of the aggravating and mitigating facts, I find that an
appropriate sentence in this case is 3 years. Given the harsh pre-sentence
conditions, I will reduce his sentence by 3.5 months. His sentence will be
reduced by a further 16.5 months for the time already served (11 months
credited at 1.5:1 for 16.5). Consequently, he shall serve a further 16
months.
[
44
]
What Mr. Lane did was deeply offensive and
intolerable, but if I was to sentence him to the sentence requested by the Crown,
I would not be treating Mr. Lane similarly to similar offenders committing
similar offences, nor would the sentence be proportionate to his degree of
responsibility, and it certainly would not respect the principle of restraint.
[
45
]
Mr. Lane will be subject to a SOIRA order for 10
years, a s. 161 order for 10 years, and a s. 110 order for 10 years. I will
also authorize the collection of his DNA as a primary designated offence. I
will recommend that he serve his sentence at the Ontario Correctional Institute.
