J.:
[

Kyle
Ellis
seeks
a
stay
of
the
proceedings
pursuant
to
section
24(1)
of
the
Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms
arguing
that
his
right
to
a
trial
within
a
reasonable
time
pursuant
to section 11(b) has been breached.
[

Mr.
Ellis
submits
that
the
total
delay
in
this
matter
is
18-months
and
14-days
from the
date
the
information
was
sworn
which
is
above
the
presumptive
ceiling
of
18-months as set out by the Supreme Court
of Canada in
Jordan
[1]
.
Mr. Ellis submits that this delay is not
reduced by defence delay or justified by exceptional circumstances.
[
3
]
The
Crown
submits
that
there
are
2
periods
of
time
that
ought
to
be
deducted
from the overall delay which would bring the time to trial under the
18-month ceiling. Furthermore,
even
if
the
total
delay
exceeds
the
18-month
ceiling,
the
Crown
submits
that exceptional
circumstances
contributed
to
the
complexity
of
the
case
and
which
justify
the time to trial.
[
4
]
The issues
I am
to
determine
are:
1.
When
does
the
11(b)
clock
begin?
2.
Is
there
any
delay
attributable
to
the
defence?
3.
Was
this
a
complex
case
that
would
justify
the
delay?
Legal
Framework
[
5
]
The Supreme Court
of
Canada held in
Jordan
[2]
that there is
a presumptive ceiling on
the
time
it
should
take
to
bring
an
accused
to
trial.
In
the
Ontario
Court
of
Justice,
this presumptive ceiling is 18-months
[3]
.
[
6
]
How
to
apply
the framework
was
summarized in
Coulter
[4]
as
follows:
i.
Calculate
the
total
delay,
from
the charge
to
the
anticipated
end
of
trial
ii.
Subtract
from
this
total
delay
any
defence
delay
to
get
the net
delay
iii.
Compare
this
net
delay
to
the
presumptive
18-month
ceiling
iv.
If the net delay exceeds the
presumptive ceiling, it is presumptively unreasonable.
The
Crown
can
rebut
this
presumption
if
it
can
establish
the presence of exceptional circumstances.
If
it cannot rebut the presumption, a stay will follow.
In general, exceptional circumstances fall under two categories:
discrete events and particularly complex
cases
v.
Subtract
delay
caused
by
discrete
events
from
the
net
delay
leaving
the remaining
delay
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
presumptive ceiling has
been reached
vi.
If the remaining delay exceeds the
presumptive ceiling, the court must consider whether the case was particularly
complex such that the time the case has taken is justified and the delay is
reasonable.
vii.
If
the
remaining
delay
falls
below
the
presumptive
ceiling,
the
onus
is
on the defence to show that the delay is
unreasonable.
WHEN
DOES
THE
11(b)
CLOCK
BEGIN?
[
7
]
In this case
the information charging Mr. Ellis
was sworn on October 24, 2023. Mr.
Ellis
was
charged
with
break
and
enter
of
a
non-dwelling
and
possession
of
property
obtained by crime over $5000 with two co-accused: Joelle
MacKay and Michael Mask. Mr. Ellis was not arrested until November 10, 2023.
[
8
]
The
Crown
submits
that
the
pre-arrest
delay
in
this
case
ought
to
be
deducted
from the overall delay.
[
9
]
The
general
rule
is
that
the
Jordan
clock
starts
running
from
the
date
the
person
is charged.
The SCC ruled in
Kalanj
that a person is charged upon the
swearing of an information
[5]
.
The Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed this
principle in
Allison
[6]
.
[
10
]
The Crown submits
that the
Allison
and
Kalanj
are factually distinguishable from
the case at bar.
In
Allison
and
Kalanj
the arrest preceded the information being sworn. Mr. Ellis was
arrested after the information was sworn.
To
support the proposition that the Jordan clock can start when the offender is
arrested, the Crown relies upon
Magiri
[7]
,
Millar
[8]
and
JK
[9]
in which the courts found evidence
that the accused had been evading arrest and that the police had taken a number
of steps to effect an earlier arrest of the individual.
Based upon the evidence that the police tried to arrest the
offender sooner and that he had been evading arrest, the court held that the
11(b) clock started on the date of the arrest.
[
11
]
The defence
argues that the police in this case were not reasonably diligent in attempting
to execute the arrest warrant before November 10, 2023.
In fact, at the time the information was sworn and the arrest
warrant issued, Mr. Ellis was bound by an house-arrest interim release order
which listed his surety’s address and the address at which Mr. Ellis was
to
be
residing.
Despite that information,
there is no evidence before me
that
the
police
ever
attempted to
execute the warrant at Mr. Ellis's
residence
or
even
communicate
with
Mr.
Ellis
or
his
surety
to
advise
him
of
the
warrant
for
his
arrest.
Rather, the
police
choose
to
attend
the
courthouse
on
November
10,
2023,
a
date
that
had
been scheduled
for
Mr.
Ellis’
trial
on
another
matter,
and
execute
the
warrant
as
he
entered
the courthouse.
Practically, that
had
a significant impact
on Mr. Ellis
and delayed
the trial
in another matter.
[
12
]
In the case
before me, I find that there is no evidence before me that would support the
proposition that the police acted with reasonable diligence in executing an
arrest
warrant.
It
is
expected
that
police
make
more
than
perfunctory
efforts
to
locate
an accused once they have an arrest
warrant and in this case there is no evidence that the police made any efforts
before November 10, 2023 to effect the arrest of Mr. Ellis.
[
13
]
The pre-arrest
delay
will not be deducted from the
overall delay. The 11(b) clock starts from the date the information was sworn.
IS
THERE
ANY
DELAY
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
THE
DEFENCE?
[
14
]
The
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
clarified
what
constitutes
defence
delay
in
R
v.
Cody
:
Defence delay
arises from a defence waiver or is caused
solely by the conduct of defence
.
The only deductible defence delay under
this component
is,
therefore,
that
which:
1.
I
s
solely
or
directly
caused
by
the accused person
; and
2. Flows from defence action that is illegitimate insomuch
as
it
is
not
taken
to
respond
to
the
charges.
As
we
said
in
Jordan
, the most straightforward
example is “deliberate and calculated defence tactics aimed at causing delay
which include frivolous applications and requests (
Jordan
, at para 63).
Similarly, where the court and Crown are
ready
to
proceed,
but
the
defence
is
not,
the
resulting
delay
should
also
be deducted
(
Jordan
,
at
para
64).
These
examples
were,
however,
just
that
– examples.
They
were
not
stated
in
Jordan
,
nor
should
they
be
taken
now, as exhaustively defining deductible defence delay.
Again, as we made clear in
Jordan
,
it remains “open to trial judges to find that their other defence actions or
conduct have caused delay” warranting a deduction (para 64).
The
determination of whether defence conduct is legitimate is “by no means an exact
science” and is something that “first instance judges are uniquely positioned
to gauge” (
Jordan
, at para 65).
It
is highly discretionary,
and
appellate
courts
must
show
a
correspondingly
high
level of
deference thereto.
While trial judges
should take care to not second- guess steps taken by defence for the purposes
of responding to the charges, they must not be reticent about finding defence
action to be illegitimate where it is appropriate to do so.
[10]
[
15
]
The Crown submits
that the 36-day period between December 16, 2024 to January 21, 2025 is delay
that ought to be attributed to the defence.
The
first set of trial dates
offered
were
December
16-19,
2024; the
Crown
and Mr.
Mask
were
available, Mr. Ellis's Counsel and Ms.
Mackay's Counsel were not.
The next
set
of dates offered were January
21, 23, 24, and 28, 2025.
Both the
Applicant, Mr. Mask and the Crown were available but Ms. MacKay’s Counsel was
unavailable.
[
16
]
Relying upon
Gopie
[11]
,
the defence argues that even if Counsel for Mr. Ellis had been available for
the first offered trial dates, those dates were not available for Ms. Mackay's
Counsel.
Therefore, the delay that
was caused was not solely or directly caused by Mr. Ellis and ought not be
characterized as defence delay.
[
17
]
Moreover,
Mr.
Ellis
argues
that
trial
scheduling
did
not
begin
until
July
17,
2024
due to
delay
caused
by
the
co-accused.
Mr.
Ellis
had
taken
steps
to
move
proactively
through the justice system and was ready
to set trial dates months before the co-accused were
ready.
[
18
]
I agree with the submissions made
by the Applicant.
On the record
before me, Counsel for Mr. Ellis was diligent
and
proactive in moving the
matter forward on a timely basis.
Mr.
Mask's actions, or inactions, caused the delay in arriving at the date to
finally set the trial date which was months after Mr. Ellis was prepared to set
the date for trial.
[
19
]
The unavailability of Ms. MacKay's
Counsel caused several months of delay
in
hearing the trial as evidenced from the trial scheduling form.
Counsel for Ms. Mackay was unavailable for
the trial dates offered in December 2024, the dates offered in Jan 2025,
February 2025, and March 2025.
The
first date Counsel for Ms. Mackay was available
was
in
April
2025.
Even
if
Counsel
for
Mr.
Ellis
had
been
available
for
the
dates offered
in
December
2024,
those
dates
would
have
still
been
unavailable
to
Ms.
MacKay's Counsel and the trial would not
have been set
to conclude within the
Jordan
time frame. Mr. Ellis did
not solely cause that delay.
Therefore,
the 36-days between December 16, 2024 and January 21, 2025 will not be
attributed to the defence.
Is
this
a
complex
case that
would
justify
the
delay?
[
20
]
The
Crown
argues
that
where
the
time
to
trial
is
above
the
18-month
ceiling,
it
falls to
the
Crown
to
show
that
the
delay
is
reasonable
because
of
the
presence
of
exceptional
circumstances.
Exceptional
circumstances
fall
under
two
categories:
1.
discrete
events and 2. particularly complex cases.
[
21
]
In this case the Crown submits
that the decision to proceed jointly against co- accused
is
justified
as
an
exceptional
circumstance
which
added
to
the
complexity
of
the
proceeding.
I agree with the Crown
when he submitted that there a
re strong
policy reasons for accused persons charged with offences arising out of the
same event or series
of
events
to
be
tried
jointly.
Delays
resulting
from
the
fact
that
there
are
jointly charged
accused
are
considered
under
the
exceptional
circumstances
analysis
[12]
.
[
22
]
But the
analysis
does
not
end
there.
[
23
]
The
SCC
in
Jordan
cautioned
that
any
portion
of
the
delay
that
the
Crown
and
the
system could reasonably have mitigated may not be subtracted
[13]
.
[
24
]
In
this
case,
Counsel
for
Mr.
Ellis
had
proactively
sought
disclosure
and
conducted
a crown pre-trial at an early stage.
On
March 18, 2024, Counsel for Mr. Ellis indicated that
she
was
ready
to
set
a
judicial
pre-trial.
The
other
two
accused
had
not
yet
retained
counsel.
And Mr. Ellis' matter was
adjourned; his matter was waiting for the other two accused
to
retain
lawyers.
On
April
9,
2024,
Mr.
Ellis
was
again
ready
to
set
a
date
for
a judicial pre-trial.
The court was advised one of the accused
had retained counsel while the
third,
Mr.
Mask,
had
not
retained
a
lawyer.
The
matter
was
adjourned
to
May
7,
2024.
[
25
]
On May 7, the Crown advised that
Mr. Mask needed to have a crown pre-trial before
the judicial pre-trial was set.
The crown pre-trial was scheduled for May 21.
The Crown at that point suggested that the
lawyers create an email chain with the trial coordinator to obtain a judicial
pre-trial date.
The matter was
adjourned to June 11.
[
26
]
During these
weeks, Counsel for Mr. Ellis communicated with the Crown’s office suggesting a
judicial pre-trial be scheduled with counsel.
There had been difficulty in communicating
with
Mr.
Mask
as
he
indicated
he
didn't
have
email.
The
Crown
called
him
for his crown pre-trial but he did not answer his phone. Counsel for Mr. Ellis
proactively bought the challenges with Mr Mask to the attention of the Crown
via email during this time frame.
In
response to the concerns Counsel had communicated over email, the Crown’s
office replied via email on June 5:
The
CPT
was
scheduled
for
May
21
st
,
but
the
accused
did
not
answer
and
it
does not appear that the CPT was rescheduled by the accused.
No
other
suggestions
or
steps
were
taken
by
the
crown
to
mitigate
the
delay
being occasioned by the self-represented
litigant.
[
27
]
On June 11, Mr. Mask explained to
the presiding Justice of the Peace the challenges he had been facing and his
understanding of what was to occur.
THE
COURT:
You’re
self-
representing?
MICHAEL
MASK:
I
don’t
–
my
phone
got
stolen,
and
my
disclosures,
and
my
video,
they
give
me
the
video
stuff,
and
went
all
the
way
back
to
Ajax
to
find
out
that
you
need
a
passcode.
So
it
took
me
a
week
to
get
back
here.
And
they
gave
it
to,
and when
I
went
to
sleep
on
the
train
to
go
home,
someone
grabbed
my
bag,
my
phone, so I missed my....
THE
COURT:
Have
you
applied
for
Legal
Aid?
MICHAEL MASK: Don’t have a phone, can’t. I got a phone
purposely just for this when I come....
THE
COURT:
What
have
you
been
doing
in
the
last
year?
This
–
this
didn’t
happen yesterday. You had a year to obtain Legal Aid.
MICHAEL
MASK:
We’ve
only
been
charged
several
months
ago.
THE COURT: All right. So even – the – yes, the – the
charges are for – from July – your first appearance was in - December the 5
th
, seven
months. So this didn’t happen yesterday.
MICHAEL
MASK:
Yeah,
so
they...
THE COURT: You’ve had...
MICHAEL
MASK:
...charged
in
December....
THE
COURT:
...seven
months
to
apply
for
Legal
Aid.
So
you
just
got
a
phone
that’s got stolen, I’m sorry to hear that, but what have you been doing
all of the other
months?
MICHAEL
MASK:
Well,
I’ve
been
calling
Legal
Aid
every
second
day
and
they don’t call you back. So, I just
self-represent and just...
THE
COURT:
So,
sir....
MICHAEL
MASK:
...go
for
it.
THE
COURT:
Sir,
with
a
great
-
great
respect,
that
is
absolute
nonsense.
Nonsense.
MICHAEL
MASK: They don’t have an office anymore, so I don’t know. I haven’t done
this
in
a
while,
but
–
I
thought
I
was
supposed
to
come
do
a
–
some
sort
of
a pre-trial today.
[14]
[
28
]
The
Crown
explained
its
position
during
this
proceeding:
M. LARRETT: Your Worship, Ms. Bezzina has not
indicated yet - from my understanding, from both Ms. Goldlist and Ms.
Stephenson’s offices, they have grave
concern
as
Mr.
Mask
is
essentially
holding
these
matters
up.
A
pre-trial
was to be
held May 21
st
, as an example, he was called by Ms. Ross, there was
no answer, the voicemail doesn’t have any personal identifiers, so she’s unable
to leave a voicemail....
MICHAEL
MASK:
No,
today’s
my
pre-trial.
That’s
what
I
was
told. THE COURT:
Okay. It’s rude to talk...
MICHAEL
MASK:
Sorry.
THE
COURT:
...over
people. MICHAEL MASK: Sorry.
M. LARRETT: There is no email that he’s left. The
email the Crown’s provided is “no email at no email dot com”. I know that email
because I use that sometimes, myself, for superfluous junk mail. And in
essence, counsel – senior counsel, Goldlist
and
Stephenson,
are
both
ready
to
move
for
a
joint
pre-trial,
a
judicial,
but yet Mr. Mask still has not had a
Crown pre-trial to be able to move this matter forward.
These
charges
are
seven-plus
months
old.
The
court
is
correct,
the
arrest date was in or
around November with an offence from last year. And Mr. Mask is indicating that
he’s been unable to hear from duty counsel – he’s been unable to hear
from
Legal
Aid.
As
I
indicated
with
the
last
matter,
that’s
great;
there’s
a
form
right
here
with
phone
numbers.
There’s
1-800
numbers
there
on
it,
and
there’s
pay phones, including at the back at the end of the hall, Your Worship.
I’m content to stand this matter down while Mr. Mask sorts out what he’s doing.
THE
COURT:
No,
I’m
putting
it
into
a
judge’s
court.
You
can
tell
the
judge
why you haven’t been doing anything in the
last seven months, and see if – if...
MICHAEL
MASK:
I
just... THE COURT: ...his....
MICHAEL
MASK:
...want
to
represent
myself
and
I... THE COURT: Yeah, okay. You can – you
can do...
MICHAEL
MASK:
...thought
today
was
supposed
to
be
a
pre-trial. THE
COURT: ...whatever you want
[15]
.
[
29
]
The Justice of the Peace adjourned
the matter into the Judge-led case management court on June 26, 2024 without
requiring the parties to schedule a judicial pre-trial.
This decision just added to the delay in this case because when
the parties returned
to
court
on
June
26,
2024
in
front
of
a
Judge,
the
parties
were

On June 26, 2024, the Judge
directed the parties to set a judicial pre-trial rather than
continue
to
wait
for
the
crown
pre-trial
to
take
place
with
Mr.
Mask.
The
judicial
pre- trial was conducted on July 9, 2024.
The matter was adjourned to July 17, 2024
to set 3.5
days
for
trial.
[
31
]
In
my
view,
the
time
from
March
18,
2024
to
June
26,
2024
was
a
period
of
delay that ought to have
been mitigated by the Court and the Crown.
In
this case, it was apparent
to
all
that
a
judicial
pre-trial
was
required.
The
Ontario
Court
of
Justice
Practice Direction issued by Chief Justice Nicklas effective November 1,
2023 directs:
15. if the parties anticipate that a judicial
pre-trial is going to be required in a case, the
parties should schedule the
judicial pre-trial within four months of the Information sworn date
.
A judicial pre-trial must be
scheduled
if
substantial
disclosure
has
not
been
received
within
four
months
of
the
Information
sworn
date.
If
necessary,
the
parties
can
schedule
the judicial
pre-trial
before
the
Crown
pre-trial
has
been
conducted
,
if
they undertake
to
conduct
the
Crown
pre-trial
before
the
date
of
the
judicial
pre-
trial.
In this case,
the purpose of the crown pre-trial was significantly diminished by the fact
that the lawyers all recognized that a judicial pre-trial was required.
Mr. Mask was struggling to manage as a
self-represented litigant
[16]
.
He claimed he didn't have email. On
June
11,
2024,
the
Crown
or
the
Court
could
have
simply
directed
that
the
judicial
pre- trial date be set right then and
there.
There
was no need to schedule the matter in front of a judge to then
set a judicial pre-trial. Once the matter reached the Judge-led case management
court, the requirement for a crown pre-trial was dispensed with and the
judicial pre-trial was set.
Requiring
a crown pre-trial to be conducted with Mr. Mask before setting a judicial
pre-trial wasted 3-months of time.
[
32
]
In
my view, the Crown
and
Court had
an
obligation
to
move
this
matter forward in much more
expeditious fashion and in accordance with Chief Justice Nicklas’ Practice
Directive.
The
decision
to
dispense
with
the
requirement
of
a
crown
pre-trial
for
Mr.
Mask
is
one
that
ought
to
have
been
made
much sooner
in the
process.
[
33
]
The facts before me are
distinguishable from the facts in
Albinowski
[17]
where the delay that ensued was the result of the
collective actions of the defence.
In
Albinowski
, all the accused presented a united front as they moved
through the system.
That is not the
situation with Mr. Ellis and his co-accused.
[
34
]
I find that joint trials can make
a matter more complex than a charge against a single individual.
That challenge does not absolve the Crown
and the Court of their responsibilities to ensure that the
matter is moving expeditiously through
the system. To the
contrary,
there
was
a
positive
obligation
on
the
Crown
and
Court
to
mitigate
any
delay.
[
35
]
In
this
case,
there
are
no
other
aspects
of
this
prosecution
that
would
make
this
a
complex case.
[
36
]
I find that any delay occasioned
because of the complexity of this prosecution does not justify the time that
this matter has taken to reach trial.
Conclusion
[
37
]
The delay is presumptively unreasonable.
The application is granted.
The Applicant’s rights pursuant to
section
11(b)
of the
Charter
to be tried without reasonable delay have been
breached and he is entitled to a remedy.
[
38
]
In
accordance
with
section
24(1)
of
the
Charter
,
I
impose
a
stay
of
proceedings
of the charges against Mr. Ellis.
