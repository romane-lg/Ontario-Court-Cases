Tomovski J.:
I.          INTRODUCTION
[
1
]
The Applicant’s trial is scheduled for the third
time on April 21-22, 2026, for what appears to be straightforward intimate
partner violence allegations.  This date is one month short of six years and,
therefore, well beyond the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling of 18 months.
[
2
]
The Applicant brings an application pursuant to
s. 11(b) of the
Charter
alleging that his right to be tried within a
reasonable time has been violated and seeks a stay of proceedings as a remedy. 
He and the Crown disagree on who is ultimately responsible for the delay in
reaching the currently scheduled trial date.  The Applicant argues that delayed
disclosure by the Crown and the alleged victim’s non-attendance for the second trial
caused significant delays that necessitate a stay.  Conversely, the Crown
argues that the non-attendance was an unforeseen circumstance and the root
causes of delay in the case are the pandemic, an adjournment of the first trial
at the Applicant’s request and a pervasive indifference to delay throughout the
proceedings by the Applicant.
[
3
]
For my reasons that follow, I dismiss the
application.  I find that once defence delay is deducted, the net delay is
below the presumptive ceiling established by the Supreme Court in
R. v.
Jordan
,
2016 SCC 27
and accept the Applicant’s concession that, in those
circumstances, the Applicant’s case is not a clear case necessitating a subceiling
stay.  Although I agree with the Applicant that the non-attendance of the
alleged victim for the second trial is crown delay, the Applicant is
responsible for the bulk of the remaining delay as I will outline below.
II.         BACKGROUND
[
4
]
Mr. Sahota is charged with three assault-related
offences against the alleged victim.  The incident dates are April 15 and May
7, 2020.  Mr. Sahota was arrested on May 12, 2020.
[
5
]
The Information was sworn on May 8, 2020.  The
anticipated end of trial is April 22, 2026, the second day of a two-day trial. 
The overall delay is 2175 days or one month short of 6 years, which is well over
the
Jordan
presumptive ceiling for unreasonable delay of 18 months for a
trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, when the Crown has elected to proceed
summarily, which it has in this case.
[
6
]
For the sake of analytical clarity, the history
of the proceedings can be divided into four phases: the pandemic-related phase,
the pre-trial phase, the adjournment of the first trial and the adjournment of
the second trial.
a.
The Pandemic-related Phase
[
7
]
Starting with the pandemic-related phase, the applicable
period is from the date the Information was sworn, May 8, 2020, to February 5,
2021, the re-opening of the courts following a second pandemic-related
shutdown.
[
8
]
After the alleged victim reported the
allegations to police on May 7, 2020, a warrant was obtained, the following day,
for Mr. Sahota’s arrest.  The Information was sworn the same day.  Mr. Sahota
was arrested and charged on May 12.  He was released on an undertaking with a
first court appearance of July 23, 2020.
[
9
]
On March 17, 2020, court operations were
temporarily shut down for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic (“pandemic”). 
The pandemic continued to affect court operations for several years: see
R.
v. Kirkopoulos
,
2024 ONCA 596
;
R. v. Coates
,
2023 ONCA 856
;
R. v.
Agpoon
,
2023 ONCA 449
; and
R. v. L.L.
,
2023 ONCA 53
.
[
10
]
At the first court appearance of July 23, all cases,
including the Applicant’s, were adjourned, with discretionary warrants, because
of the ongoing impact of the pandemic.  The case was adjourned to October 1.
[
11
]
At the October 1 court appearance, Mr. Sahota appeared. 
The Crown advised that disclosure was being vetted.  The Crown requested that
the Applicant email the Crown’s office to request a copy of disclosure.  The
case was adjourned to November 12.
[
12
]
Mr. Sahota emailed the Crown’s office on October
2.  The disclosure was shared online via the “Disclosure Hub” on October 4.
[
13
]
At the November 12 court appearance, Mr. Sahota advised
he had not yet received the disclosure (even though there is written
confirmation that disclosure had already been shared online on October 4).  Mr.
Sahota also advised that he had retained a lawyer.  The case was adjourned to
December 17.
[
14
]
Like the first court appearance of July 23, the
Applicant’s case was, once again, adjourned on December 17, with a
discretionary warrant, because of the ongoing impact of the pandemic.  The case
was adjourned to February 5, 2021, at which time Mr. Sahota advised that he “recently”
received disclosure.  The case was adjourned to April 15 for Mr. Sahota to review
disclosure with his lawyer.
b.
The Pre-trial Phase
[
15
]
Turning to the pre-trial phase, and starting
with the April 15 court appearance, despite Mr. Sahota having received
disclosure before February 5, his lawyer (hereinafter, “Applicant”) had not
obtained a copy of it and, therefore, requested an adjournment to June 10 (four
months after disclosure was first provided to Mr. Sahota).  The request was to
allow for receipt and review of disclosure and to conduct a crown pretrial.  The
Applicant, however, had not made a written request for disclosure until April
15.
[
16
]
At the June 10 court appearance, the Applicant requested
an adjournment to await receipt of the booking video before conducting a crown
pretrial.  The Applicant’s written request on April 15, however, was a generic
request for disclosure, without any reference to specific items including the
booking video (see the June 10, 2021, transcript, pp. 1-3).  The Crown
maintained that a crown pretrial should be conducted.  The presiding judge adjourned
the case to August 12 and directed that the Applicant send a written request
outlining any specific items of disclosure being sought and conduct an initial
crown pretrial even if the booking video is not received by then.  The
Applicant returned on August 12 without having had a crown pretrial.  The case
was adjourned, once again, to September 30 for the Applicant to conduct a crown
pretrial.
[
17
]
Like the court appearances of July 23 and
December 17, 2020, the Applicant’s case was, once again, adjourned on September
30, 2021, with a discretionary warrant, to October 28 because of the ongoing
impact of the pandemic.  On that date, agent for the Applicant advised, likely
in error, that they were awaiting all disclosure and that they would make a
written request to the Crown for a second copy, even though a first copy was
provided to Mr. Sahota on October 4, 2020.  The case was adjourned, yet again,
for the Applicant to conduct a crown pretrial.
[
18
]
At the next court appearance of December 23, the
Applicant advised that a crown pretrial was scheduled for February 7, 2022.  The
case was adjourned to February 17 to allow for the conduct of the pretrial.
[
19
]
At the February 17 court appearance, the
Applicant advised that the crown pretrial was conducted and he and the Crown
agreed that a judicial pretrial was not required (see, however, the December 1,
2022, transcript, in which the Crown says a pretrial was not held on February
as there was no answer when the Crown called the Applicant’s phone).  The case
was adjourned to April 21 for a trial date to be obtained in the interim.  The
Applicant advised on April 21 that he was still waiting to hear back from the
trial coordinator’s office.  The case was adjourned to June 18.  There is no
indication from the Applicant or Crown when the former contacted the trial
coordinator’s office to schedule a meeting.
[
20
]
The Applicant returned on June 16 without having
obtained a trial date.  Instead, the Applicant advised that he was now pursuing
a resolution.  The case was adjourned to August 11 with a formal Defence waiver. 
On August 11, the Applicant advised he scheduled a crown pretrial to obtain a
trial estimate instead of pursuing a resolution.  The case was adjourned to
October 20.  On that date, and on December 1, the Applicant had not obtained a
trial estimate because a resolution was, once again, being pursued.  It was not
until December 16, that the Applicant advised he scheduled a crown pretrial to
obtain a trial estimate.  The Applicant confirmed the Defence’s ongoing waiver. 
The case was adjourned to January 11, 2023.  A trial estimate was obtained in
the interim.  On January 11, the case was adjourned to March 15 to confirm the
trial date.  The trial date was obtained in the interim from the trial
coordinator.
[
21
]
At the January 25, 2023, trial scheduling
meeting, a two-day trial was obtained for April 10-11, 2024.  The trial
scheduling form shows the court offered 12 earlier dates for a two-day trial commencing
February 8-9, 2023 – all of which the Applicant was unavailable.  Of those
dates, the Crown was available for 9 of them, starting with March 21-22 and
23-24, 2023.
[
22
]
As part of the court’s effort to reduce the
backlog of cases in the region at that time, the Applicant’s case was one of
many cases brought forward from their respective trial dates to offer earlier
trial dates.  This court appearance occurred on October 5, 2023.  The court
offered earlier dates for a two-day trial commencing in November 2023 and every
month thereafter including April 2024 – all of which, once again, the Applicant
was unavailable.  Of those dates, the Crown was available for all dates except
November 2023.  The existing trial date of April 10-11, 2024 was maintained.
c.
The Adjournment of the First Trial
[
23
]
Turning now to the adjournment of the first
trial.
[
24
]
On April 5, 2024, the Applicant brought the case
forward to seek an adjournment of the April 10-11 trial date.  No reasons were
noted on the record.  The Applicant made a formal waiver.  The adjournment was
granted.  The case was adjourned to April 19 to confirm the new trial date.
[
25
]
A trial scheduling meeting was held on April 11 to
obtain a new trial date.  A trial date of June 18-19, 2025, was obtained.  No
interim dates were noted on the trial scheduling form, likely, because the
Applicant had provided a formal waiver to secure an adjournment of the first
trial.  At the April 19 court appearance, the Applicant confirmed the ongoing
waiver to the second trial.
d.
The Adjournment of the Second Trial
[
26
]
Turning now to the adjournment of the second
trial.
[
27
]
On the first day of trial, on June 18, 2025, the
Crown sought a material witness warrant and an adjournment of the trial because
of the non-attendance of the alleged victim.  The request for an adjournment was
opposed by the Applicant.  The presiding judge granted both Crown
applications.  Neither the Applicant nor the Crown provided a copy of the transcript
of these applications.  The case was adjourned to June 19 then July 21 to obtain
a new trial date in the interim.
[
28
]
This second trial was unable to proceed before
the presiding judge, who was seized with a two-day in-custody trial, which had priority
over the Applicant’s (see the June 18, 2025, transcript, pp. 2).  There was no
indication that another judge was available to hear the Applicant’s trial.
[
29
]
At the July 8 trial scheduling meeting, a two-day
trial was secured for April 21-22, 2026.  The trial scheduling form shows the
court offered 5 earlier dates for a two-day trial commencing July 2025 – all of
which the Applicant was unavailable.  Of those dates, the Crown was available starting
January 27-28, 2026.
[
30
]
At that same meeting, a date was obtained for
this application for December 2, 2025.  The application proceeded before me as
scheduled.  I reserved my reasons to December 16, 2025.
III.        ANALYSIS
a.
The
Jordan
Framework
[
31
]
The Supreme Court in
Jordan
outlined the
framework by which delay is to be assessed under s. 11(b) of the
Charter
. 
The framework as it applies to the Ontario Court of Justice is summarized as
follows.
[
32
]
There is a presumptive ceiling of 18 months:
Jordan
at paras.
5, 46, 49, and 105
.  Delay above that mark is presumptively
unreasonable, whereas delay below it is presumptively reasonable:
Jordan
at paras.
47-48, 68, 82 and 105
.
[
33
]
Delay is considered and calculated in different
ways at various stages of the framework.  At the outset, the total delay must
be calculated.  This period is calculated from the date of the charge to the
end of the trial:
Jordan
at para.
60
.  The former equates with the date
the Information is sworn: see
R. v. Allison
,
2022 ONCA 329
at paras.
35-43
;
R. v. Kalanj
,
1989 CanLII 63 (SCC)
.
[
34
]
Defence delay is subtracted from the total
delay:
Jordan
at paras.
49, 60, and 66
.
[
35
]
Defence delay can result from an explicit or
implicit waiver or delay caused solely or directly by the defence’s conduct:
Jordan
at paras.
61, 63 and 66
.  An example of the latter is when the Crown and court
are ready to proceed but the defence is not:
Jordan
at para.
64
. 
However, legitimate defence conduct is not defence delay:
Jordan
at
para.
65
.
[
36
]
When the delay is above the presumptive ceiling,
the onus is on the Crown to establish the presence of exceptional circumstances
that justify the delay:
Jordan
at paras.
47, 68, 81 and 105
. 
Exceptional circumstances are circumstances that are reasonably unforeseen or
reasonably unavoidable and the ensuing delay emanating from those circumstances
cannot reasonably be remedied by the Crown:
Jordan
at para.
69
.  The Crown
must show that it took reasonable steps to avoid the delay before the presumptive
ceiling was surpassed:
Jordan
at para.
70
.  Those steps need not be
successful in preventing the delay:
Jordan
at para.
70
.
[
37
]
Generally, exceptional circumstances fall into
two groups: discrete events or particularly complex cases:
Jordan
at
para.
71
.  The former includes medical emergencies or unexpected illnesses,
whereas the latter includes cases with novel or complicated legal issues, voluminous
disclosure or many witnesses requiring a lengthy trial:
Jordan
at paras.
77-78
.
[
38
]
Like defence delay, delay caused by exceptional
circumstances is subtracted from the total delay:
Jordan
at para.
75
.
[
39
]
When the delay is below the presumptive ceiling,
the onus is on the Applicant to show that the delay is otherwise unreasonable
by establishing that it “took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
effort to expedite the proceedings” and the case took “markedly longer than it
reasonably should have”:
Jordan
at paras.
48, 82 and 105
.
[
40
]
Meaningful and sustained steps include seeking
and setting the earliest available trial dates and giving notice when delay is
becoming a problem:
Jordan
at para.
85
.
[
41
]
Whether a case took markedly longer considers
multiple factors including the case’s complexity, local considerations, and
whether the Crown took reasonable steps to expedite the proceedings:
Jordan
at para.
87
.
[
42
]
Stays beneath the presumptive ceiling will be
granted only in clear cases:
Jordan
at para.
83
.
b.
Jordan
Applied
i.
Defence Delay
[
43
]
The total delay in the Applicant’s case is from
May 8, 2020 (the date the Information was sworn) to April 22, 2026 (the
anticipated end of trial).  The total delay is 2175 days.
[
44
]
There are several periods of defence delay that
are to be deducted from the total delay.  I will begin with formal waivers, of
which there are two.
[
45
]
The first waiver is from June 16, 2022, to
January 25, 2023, a period of 223 days.  This period starts with when the
Applicant sought an adjournment of the case in order to obtain a trial estimate
and (first) trial date but returned on multiple court appearances having failed
to do so and ends with when the trial scheduling meeting was held.
[
46
]
The second waiver is from April 10, 2024, to
June 18, 2025, a period of 434 days. This period starts with the first day of
the first trial, which was adjourned at the Applicant’s request, and ends with the
start of the second trial.
[
47
]
Subtracting 223 and 434 days from the total
delay of 2175 days leaves a net delay of 1518 days.
[
48
]
I turn now to non-waived periods of defence
delay.
[
49
]
The first period of delay is from November 12 to
December 17, 2020, a period of 35 days.  The case was adjourned from October 2
to November 12 for the Applicant to receive and review disclosure.  The Crown
shared disclosure with the Applicant online on October 4, 2020, but the
Applicant returned on November 12 having failed to download and review the
disclosure.
[
50
]
The case was adjourned in the Applicant’s
absence on December 17, because of the pandemic-caused court closure to
February 5, 2021.  I use December 17 as the end point of this first period of
defence delay, as I will address the period from December 17, 2020, to February
5, 2021, when specifically addressing the pandemic’s impact on the assessment
of delay.
[
51
]
The second period of delay is from February 5 to
September 30, 2021, a period of 237 days.  This period starts with when court
operations resumed and ends with when they were, once again, temporarily,
suspended.  Between these two dates, the Applicant attended court on February
5, April 13, June 10 and August 12, each time seeking a further adjournment
because of a failure to conduct a crown pretrial and set a trial date.  I find
the Applicant’s insistence on receiving the booking video before conducting a
crown pretrial in the circumstances of this case was unreasonable and
contributed to the ongoing delay
.
Core disclosure in this case, the alleged victim’s statement, had
already been disclosed and was sufficient to allow for a meaningful crown
pretrial.  The booking video was not part of core disclosure.
[
52
]
The case was adjourned, once again, in the
Applicant’s absence on September 30 because of the pandemic-caused court
closure to October 28, 2021.  I use September 30 as the end point of this second
period of defence delay, as I will also address the period from September 30 to
October 28, 2021, when specifically addressing the pandemic’s impact on the
assessment of delay.
[
53
]
The third period of delay is from October 28,
2021, to January 25, 2023, a period of 455 days.  However, this period includes
the first waiver, referenced above, from June 16, 2022, to January 25, 2023, a
period of 223 days (to avoid double-counting, I subtract 223 from 455 for a
remainder of 232 days).  This period starts with when court operations resumed
and ends with when the Applicant obtained a first trial date from the trial
coordinator.  Between these two dates, the Applicant attended court on October
28, December 23, 2021, February 17, April 11, June 16, August 11, October 20, December
1, 12, 16, 2022, and January 11, 2023, once again, each time seeking a further adjournment
because of a failure to conduct a crown pretrial and set a trial date. 
Further, I find the Applicant wavering between setting a trial date and seeking
a resolution also contributed to the ongoing delay.
[
54
]
The fourth period of delay is from March 22,
2023, to April 10, 2024, a period of 385 days.  This period is in reference to the
meeting held with the trial coordinator on January 23, 2023, to schedule the
first trial.  Of the dates offered, March 21-22, 2023, was the first date that
the court and Crown were ready to proceed but the Applicant was not.  The
latter was not available until April 10-11, 2024, the dates chosen for trial. 
The Applicant, in his factum at p. 5, concedes this period as defence delay. 
Further, the Applicant was still unavailable for all earlier trial dates
offered during the backlog initiative court appearance on October 5, 2023.
[
55
]
The fifth period of delay is from January 28 to
April 22, 2026, a period of 83 days.  This period is in reference to the
meeting held with the trial coordinator on July 8, 2024, to schedule the current
trial.  Of the dates offered, January 27-28, 2026, was the first date that the
court and Crown were ready to proceed but the Applicant was not.  The latter
was not available until April 21-22, 2026, the dates chosen for trial.
[
56
]
Subtracting 35, 237, 232, 385 and 83 days from
the net delay of 1518 days leaves a net delay of 546 days or 17.9 months: see
R.
v. Shaikh
,
2019 ONCA 895
at footnote 2 for the conversion of actual days to
months
.
[
57
]
The Applicant indicated in oral submissions
that, if the net delay is below the presumptive ceiling, he conceded that a
subceiling stay is not justified in the circumstances of the Applicant’s case. 
I accept that concession.  However, even without the concession, I would have
concluded that the Applicant’s case is not a clear case warranting a subceiling
stay based on the history of the proceedings, as outlined above, including that
the Applicant failed to take meaningful and sustained steps to expedite the
proceedings and did not accept earlier trial dates on three separate occasions.
ii.
Pandemic-related Delay
[
58
]
Despite the Applicant not seeking to justify a
subceiling stay, I will briefly address the delay caused by the pandemic.
[
59
]
I find a deduction attributable to the impact of
the pandemic would have been warranted in the Applicant’s case as a discrete exceptional
circumstance.  The Applicant was charged less than two months after the court first
suspended its operations because of the pandemic.  At least two temporary
shutdowns occurred during the proceedings: December 17, 2020, to February 5, 2021,
and September 30 to October 28, 2021.  Approximately one-third of the
proceedings occurred during the pandemic.
[
60
]
Appellate courts have recognized the pandemic as
a discrete exceptional circumstance: see, for example,
R. v. K.D.
,
2025
ONCA 639
at para.
50
; and
Agpoon
, supra at paras.
4, 33
.  Further, the
pandemic caused systemic disruptions to the court’s operations including a
backlog of cases already in the criminal justice system.
[
61
]
In attributing pandemic-related delay, appellate
courts have endorsed both a general deduction and one tethered to a specific time
period:
K.D.
, supra at paras.
62-63
.  General deductions for
pandemic-related delay have been given in the following cases:
R. v. Soni
,
2024 ONCJ 389
at para.
13
;
R. v. Gutnik
,
2023 ONCJ 274
at para.
17
; and
R. v. A.N.
,
2025 ONCA 300
at paras.
5
, 9.  General deductions may be
informed by a judge’s knowledge of their local conditions: see
R. v. Vrbanic
,
2025 ONCA 151
at para.
66
;
R. v. Jones
,
2025 ONCA 103
at para.
56
;
Coates
,
supra at para.
6
; and
Agpoon
, supra at para.
26
.
[
62
]
Local conditions have been considered in
attributing pandemic-related delay in the following Peel region cases: see, for
example,
R. v. Al-Ramahi & Paul
,
2023 ONSC 7281
at para.
97
;
R.
v. M.W.
,
2023 ONCJ 581
at para.
17
;
R. v. Toor
,
2022 ONCJ 8
at paras.
25-26
; and
R. v. Lokubalasuriya
,
2024 ONCJ 46
at para.
10
.
[
63
]
Although I would have made a general deduction based
on pandemic-related delay (relying on cases like
Soni
, supra), I decline
to identify a specific quantum and deduct it from the net delay in the
circumstances as it is unnecessary for the disposition of this application.
iii.
Crown Delay
[
64
]
There is one final period of delay raised by the
parties that I will address.  It relates to the delay caused by the non-attendance
of the alleged victim for the second trial.  I do not accept the Crown
submission that the non-attendance was “unforeseen” or if it was that it should
be treated as a discrete exceptional circumstance.
[

]
The cases provided by the Crown to support its
submission are distinguishable from the facts of the Applicant’s case.  In Justice
Monahan’s decision of
R. v. Tomlinson
, an unreported decision of the
Ontario Court of Justice dated May 9, 2025, the delay caused by the alleged
victim’s non-attendance at trial was found to be a discrete exceptional
circumstance.  However, the finding was based on evidence tendered by the Crown
through viva voce and affidavit evidence on both the application to adjourn the
trial and the s. 11(b)
Charter
application that the alleged victim was
ill and hospitalized on the trial date: see paras. 20-29.  Similarly, in
Justice Agarwal’s decision of
R. v. Fredrique
, an unreported decision of
the Superior Court of Justice dated October 21, 2025, the
delay caused by the alleged victim’s non-attendance at
trial was also found to be a discrete exceptional circumstance
.  Like
Tomlinson
,
the Crown presented evidence on the adjournment application that the alleged
victim was admitted into a detox facility and unable to attend court, including
the trial, for approximately 30 days: paras. 30-34.
[

]
Unlike
Tomlinson
and
Fredrique
, the
application record placed before me by the Applicant and the Crown is silent on
the reason for the alleged victim’s non-attendance.  Speculation is
impermissible.  The Crown, like the Applicant, could have but chose not to
obtain a copy of the transcript of the appearance before the judge who granted
the trial adjournment and issued the material witness warrant.  I cannot
speculate why those orders were granted.  Further, the Crown could have but chose
not to provide on this application, for example, an affidavit explaining the
alleged victim’s non-attendance.
[

]
I do not accept that the unexplained non-attendance
of a witness for trial, without more to explain the non-attendance,
automatically qualifies as an exceptional circumstance.  Such a categorical
approach is inconsistent with an assessment of exceptional circumstances, which
depends on a trial judge’s good sense and experience:
Jordan
at para.
71
.  Each circumstance of non-attendance, in my view, must be assessed on a
case-by-case basis.
[
68
]
Alternatively, even if I am in error in finding
that the non-attendance of a witness, without more, is not a discrete
exceptional circumstance, I would have found that the delay resulting from the adjournment
of the second trial was non-defence delay and should not be deducted from the
net delay.  The reason is that the Applicant’s trial could not have proceeded
because another trial was given priority over the Applicant’s and there is no
evidence that there was an offer of assistance from another judge to hear the
Applicant’s trial regardless of whether the alleged victim was present.
IV.       CONCLUSION
[
69
]
Even without attributing any pandemic-related
delay, the net delay of 17.9 months is below the
Jordan
presumptive
ceiling.  The Applicant did not seek a subceiling stay.  Accordingly, the
Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption and show that the delay is
otherwise unreasonable.

The application is dismissed.
