COURT
FILE No.: Hamilton 23-47106517
BETWEEN:
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
— AND —
STEVEN ALLABY
Before
Justice J.P.P. Fiorucci
Heard on January 23 and March 27, 2025
Reasons
for Sentence released on August 6, 2025
Dayna Tinkham................................................................................... counsel
for the Crown
Adrianne DiSimoni............................................. counsel
for the offender, Steven Allaby
FIORUCCI J.:
Overview
[
1
]
Steven Allaby is a forty-five-year-old first offender. He entered
a guilty plea to sexual interference. His victim was an eight-year-old girl who
was unknown to him. She was shopping with her mother in a department store. Mr.
Allaby grabbed the girl’s buttocks and then immediately fled the store.
[
2
]
Mr. Allaby committed this offence over twenty-one months ago. After
being arrested and charged, he was released by way of an undertaking to a peace
officer. While on release, he participated in a risk assessment which confirmed
his attraction to female children. The assessor made extensive recommendations
to reduce Mr. Allaby’s risk of sexual recidivism. Mr. Allaby has complied with
these recommendations by participating in extensive therapeutic intervention to
address the root causes of his offending behaviour. That therapy is ongoing.
Mr. Allaby has demonstrated significant remorse and insight.
[
3
]
The Crown submitted that only a jail sentence, followed by the
maximum term of probation could address the principles of denunciation and
deterrence which are paramount in the sentencing analysis for child sex
offences. Defence counsel urged me to permit Mr. Allaby to serve his sentence
of imprisonment in the community by way of a conditional sentence order (CSO).
The defence argued that a CSO, which would permit Mr. Allaby to continue with
rigorous therapy and medical intervention, offered the most protection for the public,
and would adequately address the principles of denunciation and deterrence.
[
4
]
On July 31, 2025, I sentenced Mr. Allaby to serve an 18-month CSO
followed by 3 years of probation and made other ancillary orders. I advised the
parties that I would be releasing written reasons for finding that a CSO was
the appropriate sentence in this case. These are my written reasons.
Circumstances of the Offence
[
5
]
On October 15, 2023, surveillance video inside a
Walmart store showed Mr. Allaby’s movements as he lingered within the store for
approximately ten minutes. During that time, the video depicts him following and
looking at two young girls. In each case, he positioned himself in a way that he
could look at the girls from behind. Mr. Allaby followed the second girl to the
underwear section where he stood at the end of the aisle and watched her.
[
6
]
He then turned his attention to the eight-year-old
victim, T.T., who was shopping with her mother and younger sister. T.T. was
pushing her sister in a shopping cart while her mother was shopping in front of
them. Mr. Allaby spotted T.T. and watched her. He then walked to a position
behind T.T. and after checking the surroundings for witnesses, he stepped up
behind her and grabbed her buttocks. T.T. moved forward to tell her mother. Mr.
Allaby immediately made his way to the front doors, called a taxi, and fled the
area.
Circumstances of the Offender
[
7
]
Mr. Allaby was 43 years old when he committed the offence. He is
now 45 years old. He has no prior criminal record. He has the continued support
of his mother and his sister. He and his sister have daily contact.
[
8
]
His parents divorced in 1980, soon after he was born. Mr. Allaby
grew up with no male father figure. His mother was a single parent. From his
mother, he learned that his father was abusive toward her and did not provide
any support for her and the children. Mr. Allaby’s mother has been supported by
ODSP benefits for many years due to health issues. The family lived in Hamilton
City Housing due to their limited income. Mr. Allaby described his mother as
“loving and kind” and a devout Christian. He and his sister attended church
every Sunday.
[
9
]
Academically, Mr. Allaby was a good student but did not have many
friends while at school. After high school, he wanted to pursue a career as a pastor,
and he obtained a Bachelor of Religious Education from Heritage College in
Cambridge. When he graduated, he began working at a call centre but also
started his own ministry which he called Hugs Community Church. He conducted
services once a week on Sunday. This lasted approximately twenty months before the
ministry closed due to lack of attendance and insufficient funding for rental
costs.
[
10
]
For the past twelve years, Mr. Allaby has maintained the same
full-time permanent employment with a tech company as a Senior Technical Advisor,
doing trouble shooting for phones, tablets, and software. He informed upper
management, human resources, and a few coworkers at his work about his court
matters. Initially, he was on a paid suspension due to the outstanding criminal
charges, but he then returned to work and continued to work while on release
awaiting disposition of his charges. His employment does not involve
interactions with children.
[
11
]
After his arrest in October 2023, Mr. Allaby retained the
services of Alan Kaine, a Clinical Therapist. Mr. Kaine is recognized in
Hamilton and the surrounding area for his work in the assessment and treatment
of sexual offenders. He provides outpatient services to patients with sexual disorders.
Mr. Allaby consented to a risk assessment, which included a phallometric
assessment and physiological and psychometric tests.
[
12
]
The results of the testing and Mr. Kaine’s findings are contained
in his report dated April 17, 2024 (the “Report”). The Report, together with evidence
of Mr. Allaby’s continued participation in therapy and programming, is Exhibit
3 on these proceedings. The Report contains information Mr. Allaby conveyed to
Mr. Kaine throughout the assessment process.
[
13
]
Mr. Allaby reported that his mood and affect changed after his
arrest for this offence; he became anxious and depressed at times and had
suicidal thoughts. He expressed feelings of discontent, stating that he did not
like himself and hoped to “get better and understand why he did what he did”.
He recognized that he has a “problem with unwanted, inappropriate and unhealthy
attractions to young girls”.
[
14
]
The Report details Mr. Allaby’s history of sexual attraction to
young girls. His sexual attraction to prepubescent females started in high
school. In college, he posted on a message board that he was attracted to young
females, resulting in some negative feedback. In one instance, at university, he
was transparent about his attraction to a female child of an instructor,
confiding in other students and in the instructor himself. He suffered no
punitive repercussions but saw a counsellor for two or three sessions. At the
end of his last year of college, Mr. Allaby befriended a man who was actively
involved in the church. Mr. Allaby was attracted to this friend’s daughter who
was 10 or 12 years old, and he told his friend about the attraction. Again, this
did not result in any negative consequences, and it does not appear that his
friend encouraged him to receive counselling.
[
15
]
Mr. Kaine stated in the Report that, at the time of the offence, Mr.
Allaby “was struggling with his life and was preoccupied with sexual thoughts
of underage females”. Mr. Kaine noted that Mr.  Allaby “seemed genuinely
remorseful for his sexual acting out and had no intentions of hurting this
child”. Mr. Allaby was forthright during the assessment process, freely
acknowledging his attractions primarily to pubescent females but also prepubescent
females.
[
16
]
When utilizing risk instruments, Mr. Kaine found Mr. Allaby to be
a very low risk for general recidivism due to such factors as the absence of a
criminal record, academic pursuits, stable employment, pro-social peer group
and supportive family. There were no identifiable risk factors. There is an
absence of any clinical evidence of any features of an antisocial personality,
and no evidence of cognitive distortions which are commonly prevalent with Mr.
Allaby’s pedophilic profile. The Report states, “[h]e was not a collector of
child pornography, and the sexual inventories did not reveal sexual anomalies”.
[
17
]
The Report finds Mr. Allaby’s risk level for sexual offending to
be in the average range with dynamic risk factors including “having no
intimacy/romantic relationships, negative emotionality (ruminates about
negative events; not in control of his life; does not like himself and wishes
that he was someone else), sexual preoccupation and sexual deviancy”.
[
18
]
However, Mr. Kaine goes on to say in the Report that there are
positive strengths when reviewing prognostic risk factors:
He is a first-time offender, and he accepts full
responsibility for his actions. He has an excellent work ethic. He presents as
being remorseful and feels that this is the worst thing that he has ever done
in his life. He recognizes that he needs to engage in therapy and wants help
for his problems. He has no previous police occurrences and has been a pacifist
rather than an aggressor in stressful situations.
[
19
]
Prior to this offence, Mr. Allaby had not had any contact with
mental health professionals regarding his sexual attractions. He has followed
through with recommendations Mr. Kaine made in the Report. For instance, Mr. Kaine
stated that his mother and sister “should be cognizant of his sexual pathology
and present circumstances given that they are his primary support”. Mr. Allaby
followed through with this recommendation by disclosing his outstanding charges
to his sister. He told his mother he was having legal problems but did not
provide specifics about the offence. Due to health problems and
hospitalizations, his mother has required 24-hour nursing care in a nursing
home since May of 2024 which perhaps explains Mr. Allaby’s limited disclosure
to her. Both his sister and his mother remain supportive.
[
20
]
The Report sets out treatment areas that Mr. Allaby needs to
address, including sexual deviancy using treatment modalities including medical
management, cognitive-behavioural therapy and behavioural-modification
techniques. Mr. Kaine referred Mr. Allaby to the CoSA program (Circles of
Support and Accountability), which is a community-based reintegration project
of The St. Leonard’s Society of Hamilton (SLSH).
[
21
]
Rick Pauw, CoSA Senior Outreach Case Worker for SLSH provided a
letter of support for Mr. Allaby, dated November 2, 2024, which is included in
Exhibit 3. The CoSA program involves trained volunteers working with convicted
sex offenders to build relationships and networks of support and accountability
and works “in partnership with other treatment and supervision providers to
ensure a safe reintegration into community for the released offenders”.
[
22
]
Mr. Pauw confirmed that Mr. Allaby contacted CoSA in July of 2024
to utilize their services in accordance with the recommendation made by Mr.
Kaine. Since then, he has met with Mr. Pauw and a volunteer and attended the
Living with Purpose program, “a monthly discussion group where CoSA Core
Members and participants meet to share and respond to challenges and barriers
that many released offenders face in the process of safely reintegrating into
community”. Mr. Pauw observed that, throughout his participation in
programming, Mr. Allaby openly disclosed his offence, and expressed his shame
and remorse for the offence and for its impact on the victim.  In his letter, Mr.
Pauw spoke of Mr. Allaby’s “commitment and determination to a future with no
more victims or harm”.
[
23
]
In addition to his work with the CoSA program, Mr. Allaby has
scheduled individual appointments with Mr. Kaine, attending five appointments
between November 2024 and March 2025. In a follow up letter, dated March 11,
2025, Mr. Kaine stated that he and Mr. Allaby are in the early stages of
therapy which will continue following Mr. Allaby being sentenced, with the
emphasis being on self-regulation and relapse prevention. Mr. Kaine indicated
in this letter that “[t]o date, Mr. Allaby presents as being serious about
being crime-free and managing his sexual deviancy (pedophilia involving female
children)”.
[
24
]
The pre-sentence report (PSR) dated March 25, 2025 is Exhibit 1. Both
Mr. Kaine and Mr. Pauw advised the author of the PSR that Mr. Allaby has
continued to participate in programming and therapy with them.
[
25
]
Mr. Allaby has also involved his family physician in his
rehabilitative steps. His family doctor has prescribed anti-anxiety medication
which has been helpful to cope with the stress of the court process. The
medication has had the indirect effect of lowering his sex drive.
[
26
]
Mr. Allaby has taken the initiative to limit his computer use.
Mr. Kaine reports in his follow-up letter that Mr. Allaby “is very careful when
accessing information on devices to avoid potential triggers of sexual
thoughts, urges and fantasies involving children”.
Impact on the Victim
[
27
]
The Victim Impact Statement of E.T.T., T.T.’s mother, is included
in the brief filed by the Crown, which is Exhibit 2 in these proceedings. In her
statement, E.T.T. expresses the guilt and pain she feels, blaming herself for failing
to protect her daughter from Mr. Allaby. As a single parent who lives alone
with her children, E.T.T. describes being terrified by the fact that Mr. Allaby
watched and followed them through the store before touching T.T., which has
made her paranoid of every stranger who comes close to her children when they
are out shopping.
[
28
]
E.T.T. describes T.T. as a once carefree and naïve child who now
sees the world with cynicism and jadedness. She says that T.T. was in grade 4
when the incident happened and was learning about physical health and sexual
education. Before the incident, E.T.T. would have conversations with her
children about these issues and T.T. was an active participant. After the
incident, T.T. withdrew and became uncomfortable having the same conversations.
According to E.T.T., T.T. refuses to speak about the incident because she feels
embarrassed and ashamed, and she is very guarded when she is out in public.
T.T. is in therapy to help her process and navigate through these feelings.
Positions of the Parties
[
29
]
Crown counsel sought a jail sentence of between
6 to 9 months followed by a 3-year probation order and the customary ancillary
orders that flow from a conviction for sexual interference. The Crown emphasized
the primacy of deterrence and denunciation for this serious sexual offence
involving a vulnerable child who has been significantly impacted. The Crown maintained
that a CSO was inappropriate and pointed to the fact that, according to the
Report, Mr. Allaby is an average risk for sexual recidivism. Therefore, the
court cannot be satisfied that allowing him to serve his sentence in the
community would not endanger the safety of the community. Furthermore, a CSO is
not consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set
out in
sections 718
to
718.2
of the
Criminal Code
.
[
30
]
Mr. Allaby urged me to permit him to continue
along his rehabilitative path, with the supports he has established in the
community, by imposing a CSO of between 16 to 18 months, followed by 3 years of
probation.
[1]
He conceded that the ancillary orders sought by the Crown are appropriate. The
defence did not dispute that denunciation and deterrence are the most important
sentencing objectives in child sexual offence cases and must be given primary
consideration. However, Mr. Allaby has demonstrated insight and remorse, and
has engaged in therapy and programming which focuses on mitigating the risk of
reoffending. The defence submitted that the evidentiary record of Mr. Allaby’s commitment
to rehabilitation should satisfy the court that a CSO will not endanger the safety
of the community and is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles
of sentencing, including denunciation and deterrence.
Legal Principles and Analysis
[
31
]
The principal purpose of the criminal law, and
in particular sentencing, is the protection of society.
[2]
This is reflected in the
sentencing provisions in Part XXIII of the
Criminal Code
.
Section 718
says that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society,
and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives,
to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe
society.
[
32
]
These goals are to be achieved by
imposing just sanctions. Those just sanctions
are to
have one or more of the following objectives:
(a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to
victims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;
(b) to deter the offender and other persons from
committing offences;
(c) to separate offenders from society, where
necessary;
(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or
to the community; and
(f) to promote a sense of
responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to
the community.
[
33
]
The fundamental principle of sentencing, set out in
s. 718.1
of
the
Criminal Code
, is to impose a sanction that is proportionate to the
gravity of the offence committed and the degree of responsibility of the
offender. When applying the proportionality principle,
R. v. Friesen
mandates that courts consider the wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual
offences against children, which impact both the gravity of the offence and the
degree of responsibility of the offender.
[3]
[
34
]
In
Friesen
, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) sent “
a strong message that sexual offences against children are
violent crimes that wrongfully exploit children’s vulnerability and cause
profound harm to children, families, and communities”.
[4]
An assessment of the harm caused includes
not only actual harm experienced up to the time of sentencing but also “
the
reasonably foreseeable potential harm that may only materialize later in
childhood or in adulthood”.
[5]
[
35
]
In
R. v. T.J.
, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated that the
wrongfulness of child sex offences and the harm these offences cause “pertain
as well to the offender’s degree of responsibility”.
[6]
An offender ought to know that applying force of a sexual nature to a child can
profoundly harm the child which increases the offender’s degree of
responsibility.
[7]
It is the vulnerability of children that makes the intentional sexual
exploitation and objectification of them highly morally blameworthy.
[8]
[
36
]
Parliament has enacted special provisions for sentencing
offenders who abuse children.
Section 718.01
of the
Criminal Code
instructs that when a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the
abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary
consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.
[
37
]
In
T.J.
, the Ontario Court of Appeal explained how
sentencing judges are to interpret and apply the primacy Parliament gave to
denunciation and deterrence in
s. 718.01
:
A sentence expresses denunciation by condemning
"the offender for encroaching on our society's basic code of values";
it expresses deterrence by "discouraging the offender and others from
engaging in criminal conduct". Considerations of general deterrence lead
to an offender being punished more severely than he or she might otherwise
deserve in order to send a message to others:
Lis
,
2020 ONCA 551
, at
para.
55
.
The provisions of s. 718.01 not only mean that
denunciation and deterrence must be the primary objectives of the sentence, but
that "it is no longer open to a sentencing judge to elevate other
sentencing objectives, for example rehabilitation, to equivalent or greater
priority than denunciation and deterrence in determining a proportionate
sentence". These other objectives may be given significant weight, but not
priority or equivalency:
Lis
, at paras.
47-48, 53
;
Friesen
,
at
paras.
101-4
.
As the court in
Friesen
concluded, prioritizing
the objectives of denunciation and deterrence "confirms the need for
courts to impose more severe sanctions for sexual offences against
children": at para. 101. That need is directly related to the form of
sanction required, as separation from society reinforces and gives practical
effect to denunciation and deterrence: at para. 103.
[9]
[
38
]
The unequivocal message from
Friesen
was that sentences
for these crimes must increase.
[10]
[
39
]
The Crown relied on
R. v. M.M.
to support its position
that a CSO was inappropriate for the sexual offence that Mr. Allaby committed
against T.T.
[11]
In
M.M.
, the offender was convicted of possessing and making child
pornography and was sentenced to a 15-month CSO and 12 months’ probation. The
complainant, who was the foster daughter of the offender’s aunt, met the
offender when she was 12 years old. They texted each other over a three-year
period, with the messages becoming sexually charged. The complainant sent the
offender photos of her breasts and a video of her masturbating, and the offender
sent her photos of his penis. They arranged to have sex after the complainant’s
16
th
birthday but there was no evidence that they did so. The
complainant was 15 years old at the time of the offences. The offender was 31.
[
40
]
The trial judge found that a relationship of trust existed based
on several criteria including the significant age difference, the fact that the
offender acknowledged he was a role model for the complainant, and he knew she
looked up to him and had looked up to him for emotional support since she was a
child. The offender also knew that the complainant wanted him to be her
godfather and he was prepared to do so. The Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with
the trial judge that a relationship of trust existed and said that although the
child pornography was sent to M.M. unsolicited, “it was plain that [he] had
been grooming the complainant — a child in foster care who was especially
vulnerable as a result”.
[12]
[
41
]
In
M.M.
, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the Crown
that the trial judge erred in principle and that the CSO was demonstrably unfit
considering
Friesen,
saying that “[t]hose who commit sexual offences
against children must understand that carceral sentences will ordinarily
follow”.
[13]
The Court went on to say:
Conditional sentences for sexual offences against
children will only rarely be appropriate. Their availability must be limited to
exceptional circumstances that render incarceration inappropriate — for
example, where it gives rise to a medical hardship that could not adequately be
addressed within the correctional facility. It would not be appropriate to
enumerate exceptional circumstances here and we make no attempt to do so.
Suffice it to say that no exceptional circumstances are present in this case. A
sentence of imprisonment should have been imposed.
[14]
[
42
]
In
R. v. Pike
,
[15]
the Ontario Court of Appeal elaborated on its use of the phrase “exceptional
circumstances” in
M.M.
and offered further guidance on when a conditional
sentence may be appropriate for sexual offences against children.
Pike
dealt with the application of the
Friesen
principles when
sentencing for possession of child pornography.
Pike
reconciled
M.M.
with
the SCC’s decisions in

[

In
Proulx
, the SCC held that, “
it would be both unwise and unnecessary to establish
judicially created presumptions that conditional sentences are inappropriate
for specific offences”.
[18]
The SCC stated that “[o]ffence-specific presumptions introduce unwarranted
rigidity in the determination of whether a conditional sentence is a just and
appropriate sanction”.
[19]
In
Parranto
,
the SCC emphasized that it is inappropriate for appellate
courts to require "exceptional circumstances" when departing from a
range, since “[d]eparting from a range or starting point is appropriate where
required to achieve proportionality”.
[20]
[

Pike
made clear that, notwithstanding the Ontario Court of
Appeal’s use of the term “exceptional circumstances” in
M.M.
, the Court
did not depart from
Proulx
by creating an offence-specific presumption
against conditional sentences.
[21]
Pike
pointed out that, since
Proulx
, Parliament has increased
maximum sentences and prioritized denunciation and deterrence for sexual
offences against children. Furthermore, there is a deeper understanding of the
harmfulness and wrongfulness of these offences. Chief Justice Tulloch, writing
for the Ontario Court of Appeal in
Pike
,
said:
Thus, while there is no presumption against
conditional sentences, these post-
Proulx
changes require more compelling
personal circumstances, mitigating factors, and/or the absence of aggravating
factors, to justify a conditional sentence than might have been the case when
Proulx
was decided more than two decades ago.
[22]
[
45
]
Chief Justice Tulloch went on to say:
Nor, in my view, did
M.M.
intend to depart from
Parranto
by
requiring exceptional circumstances to impose a conditional sentence. Rather,
M.M.
used “exceptional circumstances” as shorthand for personal circumstances and mitigating
factors that are sufficiently compelling to make a conditional sentence
proportionate, as in
R. v. Padda,
2019 BCCA 351
, at para.
36
. Not only
is there no closed list of such circumstances and factors (
M.M.
, at
para.
16
), but multiple seemingly non-exceptional factors taken together, such
as being a young first offender with family support who poses little risk and
takes responsibility for his actions, can collectively render a conditional
sentence proportionate:
R. v. Faroughi,
2024 ONCA 178
, 435 C.C.C. (3d)
1, at para.
99
. This is consistent with
Parranto
’s
holding that sentencing must focus on proportionality, not pigeonholing cases
into ill-defined exceptional circumstance categories: at para. 40; see
R. v.
Ellis,
2022 BCCA 278
, 417 C.C.C. (3d) 102, at para.

[

Friesen
recognizes the wrongfulness and harmfulness of
child sexual abuse and
s. 718.01
directs that primary consideration be given to
the objectives of denunciation and deterrence when imposing a sentence for an
offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years.
Furthermore
,
sections 718.2(a)(ii.1) and 718.2(a)(iii.1)
list as aggravating circumstances the fact that an
offender abused a person under the age of eighteen years and the
fact that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their
age and other personal circumstances.
[
47
]
Each of these considerations and aggravating circumstances apply in
Mr. Allaby’s case. T.T. was a very young, vulnerable victim. The sexual
touching has had a profound effect on T.T., and it is reasonably foreseeable that
further emotional and psychological harm may materialize later in childhood or
in adulthood from having been victimized by Mr. Allaby.
Friesen
observed
that even a single instance of sexual violence can “permanently alter the
course of a child’s life”.
[24]
[
48
]
I also considered the harm caused to T.T.’s family, including her
mother E.T.T., which
Friesen
recognizes to be a harmful consequence that
flows from these types of offences. The Victim Impact Statement speaks of how
T.T.’s relationship with her mother has been damaged by the incident. T.T. has
become withdrawn and is now uncomfortable speaking with her mother about topics
that used to interest her.
[
49
]
Furthermore, I find that the harm to the community that the SCC
spoke about in
Friesen
applies in Mr. Allaby’s case. He followed and
looked at young girls shopping with their guardians in a public place before
ultimately acting on his attraction to young females by sexually touching T.T. It
is reasonable to infer that Mr. Allaby’s brazen conduct negatively impacted the
community’s general sense of safety and security.
[
50
]
The absence of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor.
However, the absence of aggravating factors is relevant to assessing the
gravity of the offence and, therefore, arriving at a proportionate sentence. Mr.
Allaby did not abuse a position of trust to commit the sexual offence against
T.T., nor is this a case in which grooming of the child preceded the sexual
touching. Mr. Allaby’s offence did not involve sexual violence on multiple
occasions over a prolonged period but rather was one brief incident of sexual
touching on the victim’s buttocks over the clothing.  I mention this not to
trivialize the seriousness of the conduct and the harm it caused to T.T. but to
recognize that the degree of physical interference in the violation of the
victim is a relevant consideration in determining a fit sentence. However, I am
mindful of the SCC’s caution in
Friesen
that “
an
excessive focus on the physical act can lead courts to underemphasize the
emotional and psychological harm to the victim that all forms of sexual
violence can cause”.
[25]
Any sexual offence is serious and “even mild non-consensual touching of a
sexual nature can have profound implications for the complainant”.
[26]
[
51
]
There are several mitigating factors in Mr. Allaby’s case. He
entered a guilty plea. Although Mr. Allaby’s guilty plea was not an early one, he
engaged in the risk assessment process soon after his arrest with a view to receiving
treatment and he instructed defence counsel to engage in resolution discussions
with the Crown. The guilty plea spared T.T. and her family the emotional trauma
of a trial and of having to testify in court. Mr. Allaby’s guilty plea also
preserved the judicial resources that would have been allocated for the trial.
Those court resources can be diverted to other matters.
[
52
]
I found Mr. Allaby’s guilty plea to be a demonstration of his
acceptance of responsibility. His guilty plea was accompanied by genuine
remorse for his actions. The PSR and the Report are replete with references to
Mr. Allaby’s shame and anxiety for having acted upon his attraction to young
females by touching T.T. He expressed sincere remorse in his allocution in
court at the conclusion of the sentencing submissions, recognizing, and
apologizing for the harm he caused T.T. and her family.
[
53
]
Mr. Allaby was 43 years old when he committed the offence. He had
no prior criminal record. To that point in his life, he was pro-social, having
excelled academically and having maintained stable, permanent employment. At
the time of sentencing, he was in the twelfth year of his employment with the
same tech company. He had the continued support of his sister and mother and
his employer. This type of support and his steady and fulfilling employment are
indicators of his positive rehabilitative potential. It is significant that his
employer and his sister are aware of the nature of his offending conduct and
remain supportive.
[
54
]
The most significant mitigating factor is that Mr. Allaby has
demonstrated insight into the harmfulness of his sexual offending behaviour and
has taken meaningful steps to treat his pedophilia to reduce the risk of
recidivism for sexual offences against young females. The evidentiary record before
me at the sentencing hearing disclosed that Mr. Allaby was in treatment, was
complying with treatment recommendations, and was committed to addressing what
he acknowledged to be a significant problem in his life, his preoccupation with
sexual thoughts of underage females. Mr. Allaby’s insight and participation in
treatment for over twenty-one months diminishes his future risk of
dangerousness. Based on the record before me at the time of sentencing, I found
that Mr. Allaby was genuinely committed to continuing with treatment to better
himself and ensure that he does not reoffend.
[
55
]
The Crown conceded that Mr. Allaby had taken steps to mitigate
his risk of reoffending. However, the Crown maintained that he should serve a
jail sentence, relying in part on the finding in the Report that he is an
average risk to commit a sexual offence. In my view, given the steps Mr. Allaby
has taken to address his risk of sexual recidivism, and the absence of any
evidence that he reoffended in the twenty-one months he was on release on an
undertaking, the objective contained in
s. 718
(c) (separating the offender from
society to protect children from wrongful exploitation or harm), was of
diminished importance.
[
56
]
The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society. The
parties agreed that an under two-year jail sentence was appropriate in Mr.
Allaby’s case. I found that permitting Mr. Allaby to continue his treatment in
the community, with treatment providers with whom he has developed trusting
relationships, would provide the best prospect of achieving protection for
society, in particular children. The jail sentence of between 6 to 9 months that
the Crown proposed, or any period of actual incarceration, would interrupt Mr.
Allaby’s treatment and could increase his risk of a relapse. I found that permitting
Mr. Allaby to serve his sentence in the community would not endanger community
safety in view of his self-directed efforts at rehabilitation, which had
continued up to the date of sentencing.
[27]
The record on the sentencing hearing also disclosed that there was a concrete
plan to continue treatment after sentencing.
[
57
]
The second part of the test for imposing a CSO requires
considering not only personal circumstances and mitigating factors of the
offender, but also the severe wrongs and harms that he caused, his moral
blameworthiness, and Parliament’s prioritization of deterrence and denunciation.
[28]
This second step ordinarily results in custodial sentences because of the
prioritization of denunciation and deterrence.
[29]
[
58
]
Denunciation is the communication of
society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.
[30]
The sentencing objective of
denunciation reflects the fact that Canadian criminal law is a “system of
values”.
[31]
Condemnation of those who commit sexual offences against children “must be
communicated in the clearest of terms”.
[32]
[
59
]
Deterrence “has both a specific and
general aspect”.
[33]
The authors of
Prosecuting and Defending Offences Against Children, 2
nd
Edition
state:
The specific aspect is to sufficiently punish an offender
such that this specific person will be deterred from reoffending. The general
aspect is to deter any other like-minded individuals who may consider
committing the same offence, by crafting a sentence that demonstrates society’s
condemnation for such acts.
[34]
[
60
]
In
Proulx
, the SCC addressed how, in some circumstances, a
conditional sentence rather than a jail sentence may sufficiently address the
principles of denunciation and deterrence.
[
61
]
The SCC said that incarceration “
will
usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, as a conditional
sentence is generally a more lenient sentence than a jail term of equivalent
duration”.
[35]
However, a conditional sentence with onerous conditions which is “extended
beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been
imposed in the circumstances” can provide a significant amount of denunciation.
[36]
Conditions such as house arrest should
be the norm, not the exception.
[37]
[
62
]
The SCC noted that the “
stigma of a
conditional sentence with house arrest should not be underestimated”.
[38]
The Court observed that “[t]he
amount of denunciation provided by a conditional sentence will be heavily
dependent on the circumstances of the offender, the nature of the conditions
imposed, and the community in which the sentence is to be served”.
[39]
The SCC recognized that there is an
ascending scale of denunciation depending on the circumstances:
As a general matter, the more serious the offence and
the greater the need for denunciation, the longer and more onerous the
conditional sentence should be. However, there may be certain circumstances in
which the need for denunciation is so pressing that incarceration will be the
only suitable way in which to express society's condemnation of the offender's
conduct.
[40]
[
63
]
As for deterrence, in
Proulx
,
the SCC stated that “[i]
ncarceration, which is ordinarily a harsher sanction, may
provide more deterrence than a conditional sentence”.
[41]
The Court cautioned that “Judges
should be wary, however, of placing too much weight on deterrence when choosing
between a conditional sentence and incarceration”, pointing to the empirical
evidence which suggests that the deterrent effect of incarceration is uncertain.
[42]
The SCC went on to say, “[m]oreover,
a conditional sentence can provide significant deterrence if sufficiently
punitive conditions are imposed and the public is made aware of the severity of
these sentences”.
[43]
There may be circumstances in which the need for deterrence will warrant
incarceration which “will depend in part on whether the offence is one in which
the effects of incarceration are likely to have a real deterrent effect, as
well as on the circumstances of the community in which the offences were
committed”.
[44]
[
64
]
In Mr. Allaby’s case, having considered the principles in
Friesen
,
Proulx, M.M.,
and
Pike,
I found that a CSO was consistent with the
fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, especially the fundamental
principle, proportionality. Notwithstanding the prioritization of denunciation
and deterrence for the serious sexual offence that Mr. Allaby committed and its
effect on the victim and her family, his case had sufficiently compelling personal
and mitigating circumstances, and the absence of aggravating factors that made
a CSO proportionate. I found that the principles of denunciation and deterrence
could be met by a CSO with onerous conditions and of significantly longer
duration than the jail sentence that would have been imposed, for example the 6-to-9-month
jail sentence proposed by the Crown.
[
65
]
An 18-month CSO with electronic monitoring for the full duration
and home confinement for the first 12 months addresses the need to denounce the
offending conduct in this case. Specific deterrence is of lesser concern in Mr.
Allaby’s case given his insight and commitment to address his risk of reoffending.
However, in the circumstances, I found that an 18-month CSO with onerous
conditions is sufficiently punitive to give effect to the need for general
deterrence.
[
66
]
Rehabilitation of the offender (
s. 718
(d) of the
Criminal Code
) and the principle of restraint (
ss. 718.2
(d) and
(e) of the
Criminal Code
) cannot be elevated to equivalent or greater
priority than denunciation and deterrence in determining a proportionate
sentence in child sexual assault cases. However, they can be given significant
weight.
[45]
I considered the principles of restraint and rehabilitation and found that a
lengthy CSO with onerous conditions gives appropriate weight to the mitigating
circumstances and principles of restraint and rehabilitation but ensures that
denunciation and deterrence are prioritized.
[
67
]
I will comment briefly on the authorities provided by counsel,
none of which were binding. The Crown relied on the unreported Ontario Court of
Justice cases of
R. v. K.B.
[46]
and
R. v. Johnston
[47]
to support its position of a jail sentence. Defence counsel provided
R.
v. S.E.
[48]
and
R. v. T.M.
[49]
as authority for the imposition of a CSO.
[
68
]
The
S.E.
decision provides some support for the imposition
of a CSO. The offender in
S.E.
, like Mr. Allaby, had taken steps to
address the root causes of his offending behaviour and was willing to continue
to do so. He also had insight into the harm he had caused, was remorseful and
accepted responsibility, all of which made a CSO appropriate notwithstanding
the primacy of deterrence and denunciation. In this respect,
S.E.
demonstrates
how the individualized approach to sentencing can make a CSO appropriate in a
child sex assault case where significant mitigating circumstances are present.
[
69
]
I did not find the other authorities that the parties provided to
be of assistance as comparator cases in arriving at a proportionate sentence in
Mr. Allaby’s case. The Crown’s cases contained aggravating factors that are not
present in Mr. Allaby’s case, including more significant degrees of physical
interference with the victims. The Crown’s cases also lacked significant
mitigating circumstances that are present in Mr. Allaby’s case, such as a
guilty plea, insight, and participation in therapy and counselling to mitigate
the risk of reoffending.
[50]
[
70
]
For the foregoing reasons, on July 31, 2025, I imposed an 18-month
CSO on Mr. Allaby. I ordered that he be imprisoned for a period of 18 months and
that he is permitted to serve the sentence of imprisonment in the community. He

Science Corporation (RSC) and agree to abide by all of its rules and protocols
by providing your signature on the GPS Rules and Protocols which will be
attached to this Conditional Sentence Order as Schedule “A”. These rules and
protocols form part of this Conditional Sentence Order.
(12)
The home confinement condition will be in
effect for the first 12 months
of the Order. Remain in your residence at
all times EXCEPT:
i. between 1 p.m.
and 4 p.m. every Saturday in order to acquire the necessities of life;
ii. for any medical
emergencies involving you or any member of your immediate family (spouse,

approval of the supervisor. The written approval is to be carried with you
during these times;
vii. for carrying out any
legal obligations regarding compliance with this Conditional Sentence Order,
including reporting as directed;
viii. to attend at Central
Police Station, 155 King William Street, Hamilton, to provide DNA samples if they

Following your home confinement, for the
balance of the Order, remain in your residence, or on the property of your
residence, at all times daily between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. EXCEPT:
i. for any medical emergencies
involving you or any member of your immediate family (spouse, child, parent,

ii. with the prior written
approval of your supervisor. The written approval is to be carried with your
during these times.
(14)
Do not contact or communicate in any
way, either directly or indirectly, by any physical, electronic, or other
means, with T.T. or any member of her immediate family, including E.T.T.
(15)
Do not be within 100 metres of any
place where you know T.T. or any member of her immediate family, including E.T.T.,
to live, work, go to school, frequent or any place you know them to be, EXCEPT
for required court attendances.
(16)
Do not possess any weapon(s) as
defined by the
Criminal Code
(for example: a BB gun, pellet gun,
firearm, imitation firearm, crossbow, prohibited or restricted weapon, firearm
part, ammunition or explosive substance or anything designed to be used or
intended for use to cause death or injury or to threaten or intimidate any
person).
(17)
You shall attend and actively
participate in all assessment, counselling or rehabilitative programs as
directed by your supervisor, including to address the risk of sexual offending,
and complete them to the satisfaction of the supervisor and sign any release of
information forms as will enable your supervisor to monitor your attendance and
completion of any assessments, counselling or rehabilitative programs as
directed. You shall provide proof of your attendance and completion of any
assessments, counselling or rehabilitative programs as directed.
[
71

I ordered that the CSO will be followed by a 3-year probation
order. In addition to the statutory conditions of probation,
Mr. Allaby will obey the following conditions of probation:
(1)
Report in person or by telephone to a probation officer
within two working days of the completion of your Conditional Sentence Order
and after that, at all times and places as directed by the probation officer or
any person authorized by a probation officer to assist in your supervision.
(2)
Live at a place approved of by the probation officer
and not change that address without obtaining the consent of the probation
officer in advance.
(3)
Do not contact or communicate in any way,
either directly or indirectly, by any physical, electronic, or other means,
with T.T. or any member of her immediate family, including E.T.T.
(4)
Do not be within 100 metres of any place
where you know T.T. or any member of her immediate family, including E.T.T., to
live, work, go to school, frequent or any place you know them to be, EXCEPT for
required court attendances.

paragraph at
any
time,
any
number
of
times,
without
judicial
authorization
and
without
additional
notice
to
me.
I
waive
any
expectation
of
privacy
I
have
against
the
release
or
sharing
of
my
information
as
described
in
this
paragraph.
8.
I authorize the monitoring service
to record any or all phone calls or other communications between myself and the
monitoring service.
9.
Where applicable, I will promptly answer my telephone,
regularly check and immediately reply to telephone messages, text messages,
email messages or other communications relayed to me from the monitoring
service and/or their agents. I will cooperate fully with instructions received.
10.
I will attend when and where to
directed by the monitoring service for any purpose associated with the
monitoring of the GPS conditions.
11.
I will promptly answer the door
and allow the monitoring service representatives and/or their agents to enter
the home with or without an appointment for the purpose of inspecting or
maintaining
the monitoring equipment and, if desired for the safety of its staff, with
police accompaniment.
12.
I will
charge
the
GPS monitoring
device
2
hours continuously every day. A vibration
will
be
felt when
the
device
battery is
getting
low. When
a
Critical
Battery Alert is received, the
siren
on
the GPS monitoring
device will
be
activated
and
continue
to
alarm
until
I begin
charging. If this protocol is not adhered
to, local police
will
be
called
to
intervene, which
could
result in
apprehension
and
re-incarceration.
DO NOT
CHARGE WHEN
SLEEPING.
13.
I will not swim while wearing the
GPS monitoring device and I will never immerse it in water. Showers are
recommended over baths – if a bath is necessary, the bracelet must be kept out
of the water.
14.
If and when I feel two (2)
vibrations consecutively, I understand that this is a signal that I must
contact the Recovery Science Corporation immediately at 1-877-595-2573.
