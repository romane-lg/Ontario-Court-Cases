BROWN,

(Orally)
Background
The
defendant
Omar
Elkhodary
was
charged
in
an information with the offence of
assault, contrary
to
section
266
of
the
Criminal
Code
, on Vicki Moscoe, on the 2nd day
of November in the year 2023, at the City of Toronto. After a trial when
witnesses were called by the Crown and defence, Mr. Elkhodary was found
guilty
on
February
19,
2025.
The
case
has been remanded for preparation of a pre- sentence
report,
and
from
time
to
time
since then in order for the parties to put
before the
court
relevant
materials.
The matter is now before the
court for the imposition
of
sentence.
The
Crown
takes
the
position that this offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, based on
race, national
or
ethnic
origin,
language,
colour, religion, sex, age, mental or
physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor as set out
in
section 718.2
(a)(i)
of
the
Criminal
Code
.
The
Crown takes the position
that as a result, the sentence
that
is
required
needs
to
emphasize the principles
of deterrence and denunciation,
and
that
a
conditional
sentence is required for this offender and this case. The
defence
takes
the
position
that
a
form
or discharge
should
be
imposed.
The
Facts
A.
Circumstances
of
the
offence
:
The court has
provided lengthy reasons for judgment,
setting
out
the
relevant
evidence, analysis and findings of fact.
In the court’s consideration, the court found that that Mr. Elkhodary
was not acting in self defence
.
Reference
should be made to that judgment
for
the
court’s
reasons
in
greater detail.
The
court
summarizes
those
reasons only
for the purpose of sentence below.
The events
took place a few weeks after the October 7th, 2023, attack by the Hamas
terrorists
in
Israel.
People
were
killed
and injured and many hostages from Israel
were taken
by
the
terrorists.
A
few
weeks
later, on
November
2nd,
2023,
at
approximately
7:20 p.m., the victim, Vicki Moscoe, had
posters of
children
who
had
been
taken
hostage.
She was
placing
the
posters
of
these
children
on
poles on Yonge Street,
between Finch and Sheppard, just south of Empress Street
,
in the
City
of
Toronto.
She
was
doing
this
to raise awareness about
the hostages.
One poster
was
of
a
little
girl,
"Aviv",
with
her
mother
and
little
sister.
Another
poster
was of a different
little girl (who was not "Aviv").
One
poster
said
“Raz,
four
years old, Israeli, kidnapped from her
home by Hamas”.
The
second
poster
said
“Aviv,
two years
old,
Israeli,
kidnapped
from
her
home
by
Hamas”.
Both
posters
stated
below
the
images:
“On October
7th, nearly 200 innocent civilians
were
abducted
from
Israel
into
the
Gaza Strip.
Their whereabouts remain unknown.
More than 3,000 women, men and children,
ranging
in
age
from
three
months
to
85
years
old,
were
wounded,
murdered,
beaten, raped and
brutally separated from loved ones by Hamas.”
Below
the
images
on
each
poster,
the
poster stated, "Take
a photo of this poster and share it.
Please
help bring them...." and then
the
poster
was
ripped
so
you
could
not read
what
it
had
said
below
that.
The
victim,
Ms.
Moscoe,
was
approached
by
Mr.
Elkhodary, who approached in a confrontational manner and started tearing down
the posters right in front of the victim.
He
started
to
tear
down
the
posters she had placed on the poles.
As he had his hands
up
to
tear
down
her
posters,
Ms.
Moscoe
put up her hand on the poster to stop him from
pulling
it
down.
This
was
recorded
on
a
video clip in evidence.
The video
clip also recorded
a
number
of
statements
made
by
both parties.
The allegation related to events that followed those acts.
This
led
to
a
verbal
dispute
between
the
two
parties
as Mr. Elkhodary swore at the complainant,
who
was
in
fact
the
victim.
At one
point
the
victim
asked
Mr.
Elkhodary
his name and he replied, “none of your fucking business”.
As the victim explained during their
verbal
exchange,
that
the
posters
were of
hostages,
he
said,
“I
don’t
give
a
fuck”. He reached over again to get
closer to the posters and he continued to try to remove them in front of the
victim.
He continued
to take down the posters.
At one
point he walked away.
Then he
returned to
the
area
of
the
victim
to
continue
to
take
down the posters.
He was there with
his girlfriend.
Ms.
Moscoe
was
outnumbered
by the two of them.
Ms. Moscoe
did not threaten Mr. Elkhodary, nor
did
she
assault
him.
While
there
might
have been incidental physical contact
as it related to her fingers trying to keep the posters
up
on
the
post,
he
relentlessly
tried to rip them down in front of her.
She did not
assault
him.
He
then
pushed
her.
He
did this, the court would find, for the purpose of
getting
her
out
of
the
way,
to
effectively
intimidate her so that she would remove her hands from
protecting the posters.
His goal and
purpose
was
laser
focused;
it
was
to
tear down
the
posters
of
the
children
in
front
of Ms. Moscoe.
The
court
accepted
the
evidence
of
the
victim Ms. Moscoe as credible and
reliable.
She described the assault,
the push, as a shove, and
also
testified
that
she
felt
her
forehead
being
knocked
by
Mr.
Elkhodary.
She
felt
the pain of being hit by his hand on her
forehead.
Mr. Elkhodary had struck
her in the forehead.
The court
accepted her evidence as credible and reliable, and accurate for the findings
of fact of this court.
Accordingly,
the
assault
consists
of the push and striking the victim in the
forehead.
The
court found that Mr. Elkhodary did not push the victim in self-defence.
He acted intentionally,
with
the
goal
of
intimidating the victim, pushing her out
of the way to pursue his goal of taking down the posters.
When
another
woman
who
was
nearby,
who
was
not
with
the
victim,
said
to
Mr.
Elkhodary
that he does not have to do that,
Mr. Elkhodary asked her “if she has a problem.” He
then
said,
“What
the
fuck.
What
the
fuck is your problem.
Leave.”
Mr. Elkhodary continued
to
remove
the
posters.
After Mr.
Elkhodary assaulted Ms. Moscoe, there were two other women in the area who
approached.
These
women,
as
indicated,
were not
known
to
the
victim.
They
appeared
to
try
to intervene to stop Mr. Elkhodary from doing
what
he
was
doing,
and
the
second
video clip relates to their involvement.
This involvement with the two women is not the subject
of
any
charges
under
consideration
in this case.
There was later a physical altercation
between
Mr.
Elkhodary
and
the
two women who had earlier tried to
intervene in the dispute between Mr. Elkhodary and the victim.
This
altercation
was
not
the
subject
of any charges in this trial.
Mr.
Elkhodary
testified
that
his
stepfather
is Palestinian, and that he has family members “there”.
He testified he disagreed with
the
posters
on
a
fundamental
level,
and that he
disagreed with spreading hateful propaganda and that the posters were
fabricated.
He testified it was a
simple protest of misinformation.
Mr.
Elkhodary is larger in stature than the victim.
He admitted
that
he
pushed
the
victim
but
stated
that he did so in self-defence.
The
court found
that
he
was
not
acting
in
self-defence,
and the court found him guilty of assault.
Overall,
having
accepted
the
testimony
of
the victim, and
considering the admission by Mr. Elkhodary that he pushed the victim, the court
found Mr. Elkhodary guilty of assault. As
noted,
the
court
accepted
the
evidence
of
the
victim in making its findings, and accordingly,
in
addition
to
the
push,
the court also has found that Mr. Elkhodary struck the victim with his
hand to her
forehead.
B.
Circumstances
of
the
offender:
The
court
ordered
a
pre-sentence
report
which is
before the court as an exhibit.
Mr. Elkhodary
was born on August 6th, 1991.
He is
currently
34
years
of
age
as
of
August
6th of this year.
It is now
one month past that date.
He lives
with his common law partner, Jo
Marie
Ortega,
who
was
with
him
at
the
time of
the
assault.
He
has
no
dependents
and
no
children.
As
a
child,
Mr.
Elkhodary
witnessed
incidents of physical abuse by his father on his mother.
There
was
also
physical
abuse
by
his father on him.
His parents separated. Subsequently, he
lived with his mother for a period
of
time,
and
then
with
his
father
for a period of time.
Currently he has regular contact with each
of his parents.
He
completed
high
school
in
2008.
In
2015
he enrolled in an online University
program and took
several
courses,
but
he
did
not
complete the
program.
He
has
had
employment
positions
at
a
fast-food
chain,
a
youth
support
organization, a call center for a
telecommunications
company,
in
restaurants,
and in customer service positions.
In
2020
he
stopped
working,
but
then
returned
to
work
in
2022,
in
parts
management
and
tech support.
He stayed in that position for two years
and
then
left
that
job.
In
December
of 2024, he started working in customer service with
another
company,
and
that
position
ended in
April
2025,
when
the
contract
ended.
As of the date of the
pre-sentence report preparation, he was unemployed.
The court has been updated and advised that he is currently not
working.
He
is
in
a
common
law
relationship
with
Jo
Marie Ortega, who was a witness in this
trial.
Mr. Elkhodary’s alcohol
consumption is minimal,
and
he
consumes
marijuana
about twice
a
week.
He
reflected
as
to
how
he
should have left the area, prior to the
offence,
and
returned
to
remove
the
posters later, after the
victim left the area.
It is interesting that
the mother of Mr. Elkhodary
indicated,
as
reflected
in
the
pre- sentence report, that previously Mr.
Elkhodary suffered from anger management issues,
but
in
her
view
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
As it relates to a need for anger
management, the court has reviewed the video clips
put
in
evidence
in
this
trial
and
finds that there is a
clear need for Mr. Elkhodary to take anger management counseling, as it clearly
indicated
this
played
a
role
in committing the subject offence.
The pre-sentence report also reflected positive
information
from
Mr.
Elkhodary’s
mother Angie Mezher.
The court also
considered the letter written by Ms. Mezher and filed on behalf of the defence.
She considers
Mr.
Elkhodary
to
be
her
hero.
She commented on a number of aspects of
his background and current situation.
This
included his stepping into the role of a father figure for his sister given
their family
situation.
She
expressed
optimism
for her son in the future.
The
court
considers
the
comments
as
credited
to his common law spouse Jo Marie Ortega, including also not seeing a need for
counseling and a view that he communicates well
and
handles
emotions
maturely.
Again, that
is
not
something
that
was
reflected
in
the
video
evidence
in
this
trial
that
the court reviewed.
She has also
written a character reference letter
which
is
before
the
court,
which
the
court
has
reviewed
carefully,
together
with
all
of
the
character
reference
letters relating
to
Mr.
Elkhodary.
She
speaks positively
of
Mr.
Elkhodary
within
the context of
their relationship and her knowledge of him.
She made comments about being
present
during
the
assault,
and
for
his distress in standing up for himself and defending himself.
Again, those are odd comments, given the
much earlier findings of this
court
following
the
trial.
The
court
also
considered
the
comments
in
the
pre-sentence report by the author, from Mr. Elkhodary’s
friends
Stefano
di
Girolamo
and
Elizabeth
Barker.
Mr.
di
Girolamo
also
wrote a character reference letter which
is before the court, which reflects his positive view of Mr. Elkhodary as a
friend, and his surprise to hear of the conviction for
assault.
The
court
also
considers
the
letter
from
Mr.
Elkhodary’s sister, Ms. Aya Elkhodary, and the role that he has played in her
life as her older brother.
The court
considers the letter by Ben Bongolan,
a
doctoral
student
at
U
of
T.,
who
appears
to
be
a
friend
of
Mr.
Elkhodary.
It is
unclear
whether
the
author
of
that
letter
is
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
the
subject
offence.
It
speaks
positively
of
Mr.
Elkhodary.
The
defence
has
also
submitted
a
character
reference
letter
from
Mr.
Elkhodary’s
friend, Harrison Sless, also a member of
the Jewish community.
He
appears
to
be
the
close
friend of Ms. Ortega, Mr. Elkhodary’s
common law spouse.
He has known Mr.
Elkhodary for six or seven years.
He
also made comments regarding
his
deep
sadness
relating
to
Mr. Elkhodary having been
found guilty of
assault.
The
author of the pre-sentence report suggests
that
Mr.
Elkhodary
might
benefit
from anger management counseling.
The
pre-sentence
report
also
indicates
that
Mr.
Elkhodary
was
diagnosed
with
depression
at the age of 23 yrs, anxiety in 2022, and ADHD
in
2023.
He
is
currently
taking medication but only for anxiety.
When
asked
about
the
offence,
Mr.
Elkhodary
expressed
to
the
author
of
the
pre-sentence report, “a sense of hindsight”.
He stated that “looking back, he believes
he should have simply walked away from the situation rather
than
engaging
with
the
individuals.
He recognizes that getting involved in an altercation
was
not
the
best
course
of
action and feels that he could have
returned at a later time to remove the posters without any confrontation.
He
expressed
a
willingness
to attend
for
counselling
if
deemed
necessary”. As indicated, the author of
the report recommends anger management counselling.
C.
Impact
on
victim
and/or
community:
The
Criminal
Code
directs the court to take into account the portions of the victim
impact statement that the court consider relevant
to
“the
physical
or
emotional
harm,
property
damage
or
economic
loss
suffered
by the victim” as a result of the offence
and “the impact of the offence on the victim.”
Sections 722(1)
,
722(4)
,
722(8)
,
together with
section
2
as
the
definition
of
“victim”
in
the
Criminal
Code.
In
this
case,
the
victim,
Vicki
Moscoe
,
has prepared and the Crown has put
before the court in evidence her victim impact statement. Her victim impact
statement indicates,
in
part,
as
follows:
“Toronto no longer feels like the safe and secure city I grew up in.
I was raised in the
northwest
part
of
the
city.
My
parents valued
the
multicultural
aspect
of
our
neighbourhood
and
we
were
raised
feeling
safe and
secure.
We
knew
antisemitism
existed
but we didn’t
feel any less safe than our non- Jewish friends and neighbours.
It was completely different from the
antisemitism and
discrimination
my
parents
endured
growing up here.
However,
all
that
changed
for
me
on
November
2nd,
2023,
when
I
was
attacked
for
putting
up posters
of
kidnapped
Jewish
Israeli
children. In that moment, I experienced
violence motivated
by
a
hatred
for
Jews.
I
now
fear
I
will never again experience living safely. Knowing that there are people living
in this city who feel emboldened enough to openly threaten and act violently is
something I contend with on a daily basis.
I
no longer feel
hopeful
about
the
future
here
for
myself
and
my
children.
I
know
this
shift
in
me
has negatively impacted my children, who
now worry
about
my
wellbeing
in
ways
young
people
should
not
have
to
worry
about
their
parents.
I
spent
the
first
few
days
after
the
attack
in a state of shock and confusion.
I had never
thought
of
myself
as
a
victim
of
anyone
and it took a few days to fully grasp the significance of what had happened to
me.
I had
come
to
realize
that
I
had
been
downplaying the effects the attack had
on me so I could remain strong for my children.
I told
myself
I
wasn’t
knocked
unconscious,
nor had I been
hospitalized, but I was slowly realizing that an attack, even one that didn’t
leave
lasting
scars
or
injuries,
could be as harmful and damaging as one
that does. It took a while to realize that I was traumatized and no longer the
same person.
After
the
numbness
of
the
attack,
I
began
to feel anxious and was easily agitated
and avoided leaving the house. But later that week there was an important
family event I did not want to miss.
It
was held in a restaurant I had been to many times before, but this time was
different.
The mall in which the
restaurant was located seemed unbearably crowded.
I found myself looking at
random
people
and
asking
myself
does
this
person
hate
me?
Does
that
person
want
to
see me dead?
I started to feel warm and dizzy and my heart was pounding in my
chest, a sensation I had never felt before.
I
was panicking
inside
but
forced
to
remain
calm
on
the
outside
so
as
not
to
alarm
my
family.
As we made our way through the mall, I
found myself feeling repeatedly triggered when I would see men who reminded me
of my assailant.
My
mind
was
spinning
as
I
tried to
keep
track
of
who
was
around
us.
It
felt like at any moment someone might
notice the Hebrew
Chai
necklace
I
have
proudly
worn
for
decades
and attack me again.
I remember
quickly tucking it under my shirt, feeling shame
that
I
was
letting
down
my
Bubby,
who had left her Chai necklace to me after she died.
I
know
she
would
never
have
imagined
I’d
ever
try
to
hide
my
Jewish
identity.
The
assault
taught
me
that
anything
can happen to anyone at any time.
I had a constant fear of someone hurting
me and my children.
I found it
difficult to fall asleep.
When
I
did,
I’d
soon
be
woken
from
a
nightmare.
I stayed home much more
and even isolated myself from my elderly parents, because
talking
about
this
with
them
was
too
painful.
When
I
go
out
now,
I
am
always
hypervigilant.
My phone is always in an easily accessible pocket, fully charged and ready to
record in case
anyone
were
to
approach
me
with
anger
or hatred
and
I
can’t
leave
the
house
otherwise.
It's
been
a
year
and
a
half
since
the
horrors of October 7th in
Israel and the assault on me, yet I continue to feel as anxious and unsafe now
as I did then.
I can’t help but
wonder
how
I
would
be
today
and
how
the
past
year and a half would have been if the plaintiff
had
not
attacked
me
on
the
basis
of my Jewish identity.
Would I have been able to
be
a
more
productive
member
of
my
community
and a more present mother for my children.
The
plaintiff
has
stolen
that
time
from us.
As
my
fear
continued
to
intensify,
I
tried
to cope by installing a Ring camera on my
front door, taking Uber’s instead of the TTC, and paying for data on my
children’s phones so I could know their whereabouts, despite my financial
struggles.
However,
I
felt
like
I couldn’t afford not to invest in these
security measures, despite the stress of these added expenses.
I was brought up to
speak out and stand up for
myself
and
others
in
the
face
of
hatred and injustice and I no longer feel
as safe and comfortable doing so.
I
am just one person who has been changed by the growing hatred towards Jewish
people in this city, but there are many others, some of whom are here
today,
who
have
been
equally
impacted.”

BBC, founded in 1875 is Canada’s most senior human rights
organization
dedicated
to
eradicating
racism,
antisemitism

On October
7th, 2023, the world changed following
an
unprecedented,
coordinated
armed
incursion by Harakat al-Muqawama Islamiya (HAMAS)
against
innocent
Israeli
citizens.
On this day,
Hamas led a terrorist attack in Southern
Israel,
murdering
over
1200
Israelis and injuring over 6900 civilians.
During this attack, Hamas terrorists
brutally beat, tortured,
raped
and
murdered
men,
women
and children
at
a
music
festival,
as
well
as
in
their
homes
across
southern
Israel
and
took over 200 hostages.
At least 44 countries, including Canada,
denounced the attack as terrorism.
The
day was labelled the bloodiest in Israels history and the deadliest
for
Jews
since
the
holocaust.
The widespread global increase in antisemitism that followed has
been horrifying and has incited
great
fear
in
Jews
all
over
the
world.
As
representatives
of
the
Jewish
community, BBC
submits
this
community
impact
statement
in
response
to
the
courts
finding
of
Mr.
Omar Elkhodary guilty of assaulting Ms.
Vicki Moscoe, a member of our community, whilst tearing down the kidnap posters
Ms. Moscoe affixed
of
the
hostages
brutally
abducted
by Hamas on October
7th. The goal in widely spreading these posters around the world bearing
the
plea
“please
help
bring
them
home
alive” is to invoke public pressure in hopes of bringing the abducted home and
to inspire outrage
at
Hamas.
The
posters
contained
no political
affiliation or message of endorsement
for
the
Israeli
government.
The
statement
reflects a deep concern, fear and harm experienced by members of the Jewish
community
in
the
wake
of
the
significant
rise in antisemitism and hate motivated crimes against
our
community.
The Jewish
community is disproportionately victimized by hate crimes in Canada.
The crime
committed
by
Mr.
Omar
Elkhodary
is
not an
isolated
incident,
but
a
reflection
of
the
growing hostility, prejudice and surge in hatred towards the Jewish community.
Mr. Elkhodary’s act of hate driven
violence has shaken the Jewish community’s faith in its ability
to
live
freely,
without
with
fear
of
violence, creating an atmosphere of despair and perpetual worry.
No community should have
to
live
like
this.
No
community
should have
to
be
the
victims
of
hate
and
violence.
No
Canadian
should
have
to
fear
for
their safety
while
exercising
their
fundamental
rights and freedoms.
The presence
of hate driven crimes in Canada is sufficiently substantial to warrant concern.
Acts
of
violence
targeting
a
member
of
a
marginalized
community
not
only
harm
the
individual victim but they also leave the entire community feeling ostracized, intimidated
and
unwelcome
in
their
own
society.
Throughout
our
history,
Jews
have
been targeted and unfairly subdued.
Mr. Elkhodary’s
actions
caused
grave
harm
not
only
to
the
victim,
Ms.
Vicki
Moscoe,
but
to
our entire community.
Nonetheless,
the Jewish
community
are
and
will
remain
a
proud
and integral component of Canadian society. We stand in solidarity with the
victim and remain
dedicated
to
advocating
for
a
society where all individuals, regardless
of identity,
can
live
safely
and
with
dignity.

Canadians
affiliated through

Ms.
Moscoe
was
assaulted
while
attaching
posters on poles on Yonge Street
to raise awareness about the hostages being held by terrorist
organization
Hamas.
These
posters were created to raise visibility
for the plight
of
hostages.
Posters
share
each
hostage’s
image, name, age and nationality. The posters contained no political
affiliation
or
message
of
endorsement
for
the
Israeli government.
They have been
placed around cities globally.
The events
of October 7th, 2023, have caused deep
pain
for
the
Jewish
community
in
Canada.
One of the ways in which they have been dealing with this pain in a peaceful
manner is by putting up these posters as a way to ensure
these
people
taken
hostage
and
killed by Hamas are remembered.
Mr. Elkhodary’s actions, which were widely
reported in the media, have caused fear among the Jewish communities
by
sending
the
message
that
this
peaceful act of remembrance will not be tolerated and may well be answered with
physical assault on one’s person.
This
has reiterated the belief among the Jewish community
that
their
safety
is
at
jeopardy, leading to some hiding their Star of David while
walking
down
the
street
to
avoid
being
a victim of assault.
It
is
unfortunate
that
despite
living
in
one
of the most diverse and welcoming countries in the world,
Canada’s Jewish community is not
immune
to
the
alarming
and
growing
threat of antisemitism.
According to Statistics Canada,
year
after
year,
the
Jewish
community
is
the
main
target
of
hate
crimes
in
Canada. While
the
Jewish
community
accounts
for
less than one percent of Canada’s
population, in 2023 (the last year with available data) 19 percent
of
all
hate
crimes
were
motivated
by antisemitism
and
the
Jewish
community
was
the most targeted religious minority,
accounting for
70
percent
of
religiously
motivated
hate. [Stats Can].

The posters that
Vicki
Moscoe
was
installing
when
she
was assaulted by Mr. Elkhodary said
nothing or derogatory about Palestinians.
They
merely called for the release of the hostages and humanized
their
plight
by
highlighting
their names and photographs.
In the Jewish
religion, working towards the release
of
hostages
is
an
essential
religious
duty.

By
assaulting
her
as
she was carrying out this activity, it is
clear and
obvious
that
Mr.
Elkhodary
was
acting
out of hate, bias or prejudice against
Jews. Since
October
7th,
2023,
the
Jewish
community
in
Canada
has
suffered
assaults
on
its
safety
unlike anything
in the past 60 or 70 years. Jew haters have firebombed synagogues. [Global

By contrast, Jews constituted 4.5 percent

In
brief,
we are
targeted
for
a
full
eight
times
our
demographic
share of hate.
The assault committed
by
Mr.
Omar
Elkhodary
against
Vicki Moscoe must not be considered in isolation, but against the
backdrop of this epidemic of hate
crime
targeting
Jews.
This
assault
was
widely
reported,
both
in
the general media [Man charged with assault and hate motivated
altercations: Cops, Toronto Sun, November 6th, 2023] and in the Jewish Press
[Charges
laid
against

This assault, along
with
many
other
acts
of
intimidation, both reported and
unreported, have caused Jews to have
to
watch their backs when installing posters about the hostages, holding
events
to
commemorate
the
hostages, and
meeting
for
any
purpose,
religious
or secular.
In this context, many Jews are giving
up
on
life
in
Canada

crimes

are

Jaime Kirzner-Roberts, on behalf of the Friends of Simon
Wiesenthal Center.
That community
impact
statement
indicates
in
part:
On
that
evening,
Ms.
Moscoe,
a
Jewish
woman,
was
exercising her right to peaceful expression, hanging posters of Israeli
children
kidnapped
and
murdered
by
Hamas
just weeks earlier, during the October
7th, 2023, massacre.
This was not a
random or isolated act.
It was a
targeted assault fueled by hatred.
Hatred
of Jewish people, hatred of what
the
posters
represented,
and
hatred
of
a woman standing firm in public space.
Mr. Elkhodary’s
own
testimony
included
the
deeply troubling
claim
that
the
hostage
posters
were fabricated and
misinformation, a claim that echoes Holocaust denial and other longstanding
forms of antisemitic revisionism.
This
kind
of
denial
is
designed to erase Jewish
suffering, vilify Jewish truth-telling
and
justify
violence
against
Jews
who
speak
out.
This
case
underscores
the layered vulnerability
experienced by Jewish Canadians when asserting their fundamental
rights
to
express
their
identity. That
the
assault
took
place
in
a
public
space
has
only
deepened
its
impact,
sending
ripples of fear and unease throughout the broader community.
Within
Toronto’s
Jewish
community and especially among Jewish
women, this attack has instilled fear, anxiety and sorrow.
It has sent the troubling message that
bearing witness to Jewish trauma, particularly as a woman, may be met with
hostility,
disbelief
and
even
violence.
In our diverse democratic society, we must ensure that public
spaces are safe for all people, especially those from targeted communities,
to
remember
to
speak
and
to
be
seen.

Eva
Waldmann
provided
a
community
impact statement to the court, which
indicated, in
part:
The number
of hate crimes against Jews since October
7th
causing
unrest
and
disturbance
in the Jewish community has been described as “unprecedented”.
[Unprecedented: Antisemitism
in
Toronto
has
sky-rocketed
in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war,
Joshua Freeman,
CTV
News,
November
12th,
2023].
The scary experience of a Jewish woman threatened,
then
assaulted
by
a
stranger
is just one example of how hate is being used against Jews today.
It is more than disappointing for Jews to
be targeted like this, years after trying to heal from the wounds
and
losses
of
the
Holocaust.
It
is outrageous, it
is unfair and often, deliberately cruel.
I
felt
fear
and
indignation
when
I
learned that
this
man
accosted
a
local
citizen,
an older
Jewish woman, like me, like so many
others.
By
demanding
she
rip
down
hostage
posters,
he was disparaging the wish of the Jewish community to have loved ones
returned home, safely if possible.
This
utter lack of sympathy for the grief that the Jewish community is experiencing
intensifies our pain.
It
reinscribes
the
trauma
of
October
7th.
That was the day of a massacre instigated
by
Hamas;
a
terrorist
organization that has openly announced
their intent to eliminate the state of Isreal and all Jews,
worldwide.
His
choice
to
threaten
Jews
and
try
to
impede their right to free speech
contributes to a general sense I’ve had that this city is no longer a peaceful
one.
I’ve always loved Toronto
because
I’ve
experienced
it
as
a
place
where
people
generally
feel
safe.
It no longer feels that way due to several
instances in which Jewish people have been threatened,
interfered
with,
frightened
and even
harmed.
After hearing
about the way Mr. Elkhodary tried to intimidate a Jewish woman, I feel
extremely
vigilant
when
taking
a
walk.
This is because I don’t know if someone
like him might try to approach and threaten me.
I also
feel
worried
about
the
safety
and
well- being of the rest of the Jewish
community.

In the Jewish

By assaulting Ms. Moscoe during this act
of profound

in part as follows:
As
a
social
justice
advocate,
I
too
put
up
stickers
of
our
hostages,
looking
to
raise awareness of the dire situation and
any support and assistance to Let Them Go!
Seeing these
innocent faces, babies, children, teens, elderly, women and men, having
been
brutally
ripped
away
from
their homes, now being brutally ripped
down was heartbreaking and crushing.
The
use of intimidation
tactics
from
others
like
verbal
assault, photography and being followed, especially
against
a
small,
middle
aged, defenseless
woman,
caused
great
concern.
A number of
times I was forced to change my route home as I didn’t want to lead people who
I didn’t know what they might do to my home
and
my
family.
I
had
to
delay
my
return by over an hour,
using circuitous routes and waiting for long periods of time, constantly
looking over my shoulder, to ensure I was alone and safe to return, completely
physically,
mentally
and
emotionally
drained. It was so surreal that I found
myself wondering at times how this could be real life when it was so much like
a bad movie. To
then
only
have
to
once
again
have
another conversation with my children
about safety. Not taking the same route to school every day. Being very aware
of who was around the house
when
leaving
and
arriving
back.
How
to recognize
if
someone
is
following
you
and
who to call if something were to happen.
Also having
to
have
conversations
within
our
own community with others
who also wanted to raise
awareness,
to
keep
them
safe
and
deal
with
rising
and
intense
fears
around
putting up a sticker
to raise awareness about an inhumanity against us.
And then to have to inform
my
synagogue
where
I
regularly
attend and
do
outreach
for,
about
these
issues
and concerns and discuss an increase of
safety measures for there as well.
There
was a brief
moment
where
I
considered
not
going
to synagogue anymore.
That was one of the lowest
moments,
to
even
have
that
thought,
however briefly.
To consider
for the safety of my family and community, to have this taken away from me, it
is difficult to put into
words
the
feelings
that
I
and
so
many
of
us
were
going
through
and
scarring
us
through
this time.

When

are comfortable publicly manifesting their contempt for us.
I no longer feel safe or able to easily
trust others.
I constantly worry
how
strangers
will
react
if
they
knew
I
was Jewish.
Before October 7th, I
never questioned
if
professionals
I
was
involved with were antisemitic, but now
it's a constant concern.
I'm careful
about what public events I attend, which companies I frequent,
and
which
areas
of
the
city
I
go
to
and which to avoid.
In short, I now
feel unwelcome
and
uncomfortable
and
unsafe
in
my
own city.

Rita
Rusu,
a
friend
of
the
victim
Vicki Moscoe, has made a statement with
contents consistent
with
other
community
impact
statements
in
evidence.
She
indicated
in
part:
The
assault
committed
by
Mr.
Elkhodary
against Ms. Moscoe cannot be viewed in isolation.
It
is
part
of
an
epidemic
of
hate
crimes targeting Jews, an epidemic that has forced our community to live in
fear.
Jews now hesitate to install
posters, hold commemorative events, or even gather for religious
or
secular
purposes
without
looking over their
shoulders.
This climate of fear has
driven many Jews to reconsider their future in Canada.

Dr. David Mandel, a senior scientist
with
DND
and
cross
appointed
as
Professor
of Psychology
at
the
University
of
Waterloo
and York University, and a member of the
Jewish community,
indicated
in
his
community
impact statement in part:
Ms.
Moscoe
was
not
only
peacefully
postering, she
was
carrying
out
a
religious
duty
that
is central to Judaism, her religion.
In the Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot
Aniyim 8:-11, Maimonides states, “The redeeming of captives
takes
precedence
over
supporting
the poor or clothing them. There is no greater mitzvah
than
redeeming
captives
for
the
problems
of
the
captive
include
being
hungry,
thirsty,
unclothed,
and they are in
danger of their lives too. Ignoring the need to redeem captives goes against
these
Torah
laws:
“Do
not
harden
your heart or shut your hand against your
needy fellow” (Devarim 15:7). Ms. Moscoe, therefore, was not only assaulted
that day. Mr. Elkhodary prevented her from peacefully carrying out her
religious duty because of his
prejudice,
hatred,
and
callousness
toward Jews.
In
short,
Mr.
Elkhodary
decided
to
use
his
physical
force
to
impose
fate
control over Ms. Moscoe, denying her the
ability to freely
exercise
her
Canadian
Charter
right
to freely practice her
religious duty, no less at
a
time
of
great
pain
and
suffering
for
the Jewish
people,
including
our
Jewish
community in
Toronto.
Mr.
Elkhodary
sought
to
increase the pain and suffering our
community was already experiencing over the horrific program
against
Jews
in
Israel.
He
sought
to deny our community a means of
peacefully expressing that grief.
Due to the
increasing violence against the Jewish community and normalization of that
violence,
I
no
longer
feel
safe
in
Toronto.
I
am
not
alone.
Day
in
and
day
out,
I
hear
my fellow Jewish community members express those same fears.
Our fears and the very real
threats
we
face
are
not irrational,
they are not phobias.
Rather, they stem from actions
such
as
those
committed
by
Omar
Elkhodary
against
Vicki
Moscoe.
They
include his assault,
which is widely known about in the Jewish community, as a prime example.

Joanna
Salit,
a
Registered
Social
Worker and Trauma Therapist, who is a member of the Jewish community,
stated in her community impact statement in part:
I
used
to
love
Toronto
and
valued
the
freedom
and
diversity
of
this
city.
Ever
since
I
was young, I always felt
comfortable going anywhere by foot, transit or car.
As an adult, we intentionally chose to live in a downtown
diverse
area
so
that
my
family
could
interact with people from a variety of backgrounds and belief systems.
October 7th changed all of that.
When one Jewish person
is injured, we all feel the pain.
On
October 8th, I naively thought
that
my
neighbours
would
now
finally understand the level
of hatred and violence Jewish people face.
Instead,
we were met with
hostility,
put
downs
and
aggression.
It was the opposite of understanding and compassion.
It
added
a
significant
layer
of
trauma to the one my nervous system was already
facing.
When
I
saw
the
video
of
Mr.
Elkhodary pulling down the posters of our family
in
a
crass
and
aggressive
manner,
I was
shocked,
hurt
and
frankly,
terrified.
It
also
minimized
the
experience
of
our
grief and attempted to dehumanize us.
Now,
when
I
go
for
a
walk
with
my
dog,
I
am
regularly
confronted with hateful posters
on
poles
and
hateful
signs
on
my neighbours’ lawns.
I hesitate leaving my little
area.
I
am
always
hypervigilant
and have been having recurring nightmares of needing to pack my
things quickly and flee this city and country.
I am constantly scanning
my
environment
to
ensure
that
I
am safe.
I see a trauma therapist regularly. We now have security cameras and I obsessively
check that all doors are locked. I
changed
my
name
on
public
facing
apps,
hide my Jewish necklace and have removed
any mention of work experience in Jewish mental health agencies on my LinkedIn
account.
My son is visibly Jewish; he
wears a kippa and other attire that indicate such.
I especially
worry
that
he
will
be
attacked
in the
same
way
that
Ms.
Moscoe
was
assaulted,
or worse. We talk regularly about safety
planning.
That
is
the
final
community
impact
statement that was put in evidence.
LEGAL
PARAMETERS
In this case, the Crown has proceeded summarily.
The
punishment
is
set
out
in
section 787
of the
Criminal Code
, which
provides:
“Where
the
Crown
proceeds
summarily,
for
most offences where the punishment is not
prescribed otherwise, the maximum punishment is two years less a day jail.
There is no minimum punishment.”
POSITIONS
OF
CROWN
AND
DEFENCE
ON
SENTENCE:
The Crown
submits that the appropriate sentence
in
this
case
is
one
of
a
five-month conditional sentence, with the
first third being
house
arrest
with
limited
exceptions, the
second
third
being
a
restrictive
curfew of five p.m. to eight a.m., and the final third being a
curfew of ten p.m. to eight a.m.
The
Crown opposes any form of discharge.
The
Crown submits that this should
be
followed
by
a
12-month
probation order.
The Crown also seeks ancillary orders,
being
a
DNA
sample
for
the
secondary designated
offence
of
assault,
and
a
section
110
weapons
prohibition
order
for
a
five-
year
period.
The
defence
submits
that
the
appropriate
sentence is an absolute discharge. Alternatively,
the
defence
submits
that
if
the court finds that additional supervision is required, then
a conditional discharge should
be
imposed.
The
defence
did
not
make any submissions regarding the
ancillary orders sought by the Crown.
MITIGATING
AND
AGGRAVATING
FACTORS:
Mitigating
There
are mitigating factors in this case. This consists of a statement of remorse by
Mr.
Elkhodary,
which
was
given
to
the
court,
and indicated as follows:
“Thank you for the
opportunity, quite long process, want to formally apology to Vicki Moscoe.
It
is
safe
to
say
I
overreacted
in this scenario.
In
moment I argued self defence, come to life, court disagree, I respect
that,
I
reflect
on
that,
at
first
I upset,
took
me
time
to
process
it
after
the presentence report and sit down and
think  about
it
and
conversations
with
my
wife
and
mother,
sister,
family,
have
their
support, they
remind
me
this
out
of
my
character
and not who I am.
Apology to
court, I deal with large amount challenges from anxiety and ADHD, twisted
vertebrae,
I
uncomfortable,
not
revealed
to court, explanation for time I seemed dismissive
or
uninterested,
not
reflecting
my
feelings
towards
the
court,
just
a
reality
of what I deal with, so no disrespect to you as a judge.
My
experiences
as
an
Arab
is
that
I
have
seen
a number of world events, highly calibrated to paint a picture of evil in the
middle east, seen in movies, all make assumptions, play video games, call of
duty, no shortage of
Arabs
as
villains
in
modern
times.
On October
6, 5, 8, and for 50 to 60 years before that, not discussed, I do not support
Hamas
or
the
way
it
acted
on
October
7th,
nut
to act as if Israel has suffered more loss; any day loss of life or prisoners
is un- Canadian.
The fact I walk in
street and see support for a country we all know currently at
the
highest-level
government
commits
pain, I’m
not here argue about the people, only that hurts to live through, it does not
justify
anything,
I
overreacted,
I
should
not have
engaged
in
physical
confront,
no
need, destroys examples I tried lead in
my life
Since
found
guilty
only
longer
reflection
of
this
and
I
need
to
do
more
work
to
become
the type of person I would like to see in the community.
Since this time, there have been multiple
videos
on
internet.
I
have
not
been
working
the
last
few
months,
not
been
able
to
get job call backs.
I lost a job call back, just one day let
go, and since then house arrest, not paint myself as victim, I am facing the
consequences head on.
I have not
turned
to
more
anger,
only
pursuits
in
my
own pain
and
moved
forward
and
get
back
living like
function with rest of society.”
The
court
accepts
this
statement
as
a
genuine indication of remorse for what Mr.
Elkhodary did to the victim, Ms. Moscoe.
It
is more genuine and authentic an indication of remorse than what was reflected
as his statement
to
the
author
of
the
pre-sentence report, which effectively was
indicated as his sense of hindsight that he should have simply
walked
away
from
the
situation
rather than
engaging
with
the
people,
that
he
could have returned later to remove the
posters without confrontation.
This
is an interesting
statement,
this
court
would
note
in passing.
Nonetheless, he seems to
have reflected
more
upon
his
acts,
as
of
the
time he made his statement in court.
Mr.
Elkhodary
has
no
prior
criminal
record.
He is a first
offender.
He has indicated a
willingness to attend for counseling if the court
is
of
the
view
that
it
is
required.
It does not appear that he has done any counselling
to
this
point
in
time.
Aggravating:
There
are
aggravating
factors
in
this
case.  Firstly, the court finds that it
was an offence
motivated
by
bias,
prejudice
or
hate.
Section
718.2
(a)(i), of the
Criminal Code
provides that it is statutorily
aggravating where an offence is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on
race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental
or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor. In this
case, the offence was motivated
arising
from
the
complainant
being a member of the Jewish community, and/or by the
victim
taking
steps
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the child hostages in Israel who were abducted by members of Hamas.
In this case, the defence has submitted
that the court should not find that the offence was motivated
by
hate,
as
that
has
not
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The
defence
submits
that
there
is
no
evidence
that the victim was targeted or sought out because she was a member of the
Jewish community,
or
a
woman,
and
that
the
assault
was not accompanied by antisemitic words phrases or gestures.
The court finds that there is no need for
there to be antisemitic words
phrases
or
gestures,
for
the
offence
to be
hate
motivated.
The
court
has
also
found
that
the assault was motivated by Mr. Elkhodary’s desire to silence the victim essentially;
by
removing
her
posters
and
her
right to free speech.
It was clearly motivated
by his desire that she not place posters publicly speaking on behalf of Israeli
child
hostages
taken
by
Hamas.
The
court has found that the offence was motivated
by
hate,
given
the
context
within
which
the
assault
was
committed,
as
set
out in the reasons for judgment.
The defence makes the alternate submission
that if the court finds that it was motivated by hate, that it was nonetheless
a minimal type of offence
and
that
a
discharge
is
appropriate.
Secondly,
the victim was assaulted when she was engaging in a peaceful act of putting up
posters,
pursuing
her
freedom
of
speech,
on
a
main street in Toronto.
She did not
do or say
anything
that
was
in
any
way
provocative,
this was an unprovoked assault in the circumstances.
The
victim
was
also
a
woman,
smaller
in
stature
than
the
accused,
and
she
was alone, while Mr. Elkhodary was accompanied by his girlfriend nearby.
In addition,
as set out above, it is aggravating
that
the
victim
suffered
victim impact as set out above, see also
section
718.2
(a)(iii.1)
SENTENCING
PRINCIPLES:
Analysis:
The
court bears in mind the guiding comments of the Supreme Court of Canada
in
R. v. Lacasse
, [201] S.C.J. No. 64.
In
that judgment, the court stated that sentencing ranges
are
primarily
guidelines,
not
hard
and fast
rules.
Even
if
an
appellate
court
has
established a range, it may be that a fact pattern may arise which is
sufficiently dissimilar
to
past
decisions
that
the
range must be expanded.
Sentencing ranges are nothing more than
summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which
serve
in
any
given
case
as
guides
for
the application of all the relevant principles and objectives.
However, they should not be considered
"averages", let alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen
as
historical
portraits
for
the
use
of sentencing
judges, who must still exercise their
discretion
in
each
case.
Accordingly,
a sentencing range is not a straitjacket to the exercise of discretion of a
sentencing judge.
Each crime is
committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile.
Everything
depends
on
the
gravity
of the offence, the offender's degree of responsibility
and
the
specific
circumstances of
each
case.
Sentencing
ranges
must
in
all
cases
remain
only
one
tool
among
others
that
are intended to aid trial judges in their
work.
In
2010,
the
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
noted
in
R. v. Nasogaluak
,
2010 SCC 6 (CanLII)
, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206 (S.C.C.), at
paragraph
43
, that "[n]o one sentencing
objective
trumps
the
others
and
it
falls to the sentencing judge to determine which objective or objectives merit
the greatest
weight,
given
the
particulars
of
the
case."
Sentencing
is
highly
individualized,
see
R.
v.
Suter
,
2018
SCC
34
and
most
particularly
at paragraph four.
In
2021,
The
Supreme
Court
of
Canada
in
R.
v. Parranto,
2021 SCC 46 (CanLII)
, [2021] S.C.J. No. 46, in
the majority judgment at paragraph 10, the court stated
that
proportionality
is
the
organizing principle for the court in
imposing a fair, fit
and
principled
sentence.
Proportionality
is
the
fundamental
principle.
Sentences
must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the
offender,
and
the
unique
circumstances
of each case.
Parity and individualization are important, yet secondary principles. The demands
of
proportionality
must
be
calibrated by reference to the sentences
imposed in other
cases.
Individualization
is
central
to
the
assessment of proportionality in that it demands consideration of the
individual circumstances
of
each
offender,
as
set
out
in
paragraph 12.
The court
has reviewed
all
of the cases referred
to
by
the
defence
and
by
the
Crown.
The absence of mention by this court of any case does not mean that this court
has not considered a particular case.
It
simply reflects the court’s view that the circumstances in those cases are not
of assistance
in
considering
the
appropriate
sentence in this case.
The principle
of proportionality is also codified
in
the
Criminal
Code
,
which
states that
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
court
must be
proportionate to the gravity of the offence
and
the
degree
of
responsibility
of the offender (see 718.1 of the
Criminal
Code
).
Further, the
court bears in mind that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect
society
and
to
contribute,
along
with crime
prevention
initiatives,
to
respect
for the law and the maintenance of a just,
peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of
the objectives
of
denunciation,
deterrence
(both generally
and
specifically
for
the
offender),
separation of the offenders from society where necessary,
rehabilitation, to provide reparation
for
harm
done
to
victims
or
to
the community, and to promote a sense of responsibility
in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims or to the
community (see
section 718
of the
Criminal
Code
).
The
court
bears
in
mind
any applicable sentencing principles as
set out in
section 718.2
, and as well the principles of
parity,
totality
and
judicial
restraint
in considering a sentence of deprivation of liberty or
imprisonment, as set out in
section 718.2
(b) through (e).
The emphasis of
the
court
in
considering
those
various objectives depends on the nature of the offence, and the
circumstances of the
offender.
The court considers the
nature of the offence,
together
with
the
circumstances
of the offender.
Nature
of
the
offence:
People
in
Canada
have
the
fundamental
freedom
of
thought,
belief,
opinion
and
expression,
guaranteed by
section 2(b)
of the
Canadian Charter
of
Rights
and
Freedoms.
The
victim
in this case was expressing views fundamentally
protected
by
our
Charter,
when
she
put up the posters related to the children who had been taken hostage from
Israel.
She was expressing her views
in a lawful
way.
The
actions
of
Mr.
Elkhodary
in assaulting the victim were actions designed to undermine her freedom
of expression protected
by
the
Charter.
He
acted
in
a
way to intimidate the victim, a smaller
person, who was alone on the street putting up the posters when he was present
with his girlfriend, thereby outnumbering the victim. His actions were designed
to intimidate the victim,
to
show
her
that
if
she
expressed
her views by putting up the posters, this
would be met by aggression and violence, and in this
case,
an
assault
by
Mr.
Elkhodary
on
her.
Bearing in
mind the findings of this court, the
court
finds
that
Mr.
Elkhodary’s
actions were motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, based
on
the
victim
expressing
views
related to people who are Jewish.
Mr. Elkhodary is from the evidence in this
trial, in support of people who are Palestinian.
He indicated his stepfather is Palestinian, his stepbrother
is
Palestinian,
and
he
has
family
in
Gaza.
He
clearly
expressed
his
views
in his evidence that he essentially
fundamentally
disagrees
with
the
content
of what was in the posters, which supported people
from
Israel.
There
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
hate
crime
in
that
respect,
as
the
only
reason
for
Mr.
Elkhodary
committing
the intentional
assault on the victim was to intimidate her, and discourage her from expressing
views in support of the Jewish people
who
supported
the
hostages
in
Israel
who had been taken by Hamas
.
It
is an aggravating factor pursuant to
section 718.2
(a)(i) of the
Criminal
Code
.
Courts
have
considered
this
type
of
offence
in various cases.

C.C.C.
2d
376
,
at
page
379,
the
Ontario Court of Appeal, speaking for
that court, made the following comments.
Justice
Dubin commented upon the racially motivated assault
upon
the
victim,
stating
at
paragraph
eight,
“It
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
society
that every member must respect the dignity, privacy and person of the other.
Crimes of violence
increase
when
respect
for
the
rights of others decreases, and, in that
manner, assaults
such
as
occurred
in
this
case
attack
the
very
fabric
of
our
society.
Parliament's concern for the incitement of racial hatred is reflected in
section 281
of the
Criminal Code
.
An
assault
which
is
racially
motivated renders the offence more heinous.
Such assaults,
unfortunately,
invite
imitation
and
repetition
by
others
and
incite
retaliation. The danger is even greater
in a multicultural, pluralistic urban society. The
sentence
imposed
must
be
one
which
expresses the public abhorrence for
such conduct
and
their
refusal
to
countenance
it.”
The comment
in that case related to the principle
of
general
deterrence,
and
the court
would
note
as
well,
denunciation.
In
R.
v
Soles,
[1998]
OJ
No.
5061,
(Gen
Div)
,
the
court considered offences related to knocking over monuments of deceased
members of
the
Jewish
community,
in
the
B’nai
Israel
Cemetery.
The court noted that
the offences were
racially
motivated
and
intended
to
cause
emotional injury and shock to the Jewish community, which it did.
Victim impact statements were filed which
demonstrated the profound
grief
among
members
of
the
Jewish
community (see paragraphs 5 and 6).
The
court referred, at paragraph 20, to the pluralistic mosaic of Canada, enshrined
in
section 27
of the
Charter
, which indicates that the Charter shall be
interpreted in a manner
consistent
with
the
preservation
and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.
The
court
found
that
denunciation was an
important principle.
The court found that
it
must
reflect
society’s
abhorrence
of
this
type
of
crime
and
allowed
the
Crown’s
appeal
against
sentence.
Subsequently,
in
R. v. Lelas
,
1990 CanLII 6836 (ON CA)
, [1990] OJ No. 1587, (C.A.), the court considered the
case where
the
accused
was
a
member
of
the
Ku
Klux Klan, described himself as a racist,
and spray-painted antisemitic symbols and slogans, or or near a synagogue on a
Hebrew school
building
and
on
an
automobile.
In
the
majority judgment, the court found that the offence
targeting
a
place
of
worship,
done
to cause emotional injury
to a particular segment of society, required a greater penalty.
The court stated, at paragraph 31:
“The
message
must
go
out
loud
and
clear
that conduct such as that engaged in by
the respondent
will
not
be
tolerated
in
Canadian society,
and
if
it
is
engaged
in,
it
will
be met with a
severe penalty.”
Following
R.
v.
Ingram
and
Grimsdale
,
the court stated that whether the Jews
are a racial
or
religious
group
is
irrelevant.
“An offence which is directed against a particular racial or
religious group is more heinous as it attacks the very fabric of our society.”
The
court
also
commented
upon
this
not being an isolated occurrence, and the comments of Justice Dubin that such
offences invite
imitation
and
incite
retaliation.
In
R.
v.
Simms
,
[1990]
A.J.
No.
1050
(Alberta
C.A.)
, the court commented in the consideration of a sentence appeal for assault
related offences, that “Conduct fostered by philosophies and beliefs that condone
and extol violence as a means of disapproval of those perceived to be in
opposition
to
those
philosophies
and
beliefs
must be sternly denounced by the courts.”. The court found denunciation to be
an important factor where the offences were motivated
by
a
philosophy
espoused
by
a
group
supported by the appellants and acted out against the victim as a member
perceived to be a group opposed to that philosophy.
The court has
also carefully considered the cases
of
R
.
v.
Doyle,
[2024]
OJ
No.
5583
,
R.

Cooper
,

R.
v. Sandouga
,
2002 ABCA 196
, and
R.
v. Hennesy
,
2021
ONCJ
263
.
In
R.
v.
Abed
,
Unreported,
OCJ March
11, 2025, at paragraph 32, Justice Borenstein,
a
colleague
of
mine,
indicated
in reasons
for
sentence
relating
to
a
charge
of mischief, in relation to the grabbing
of an Israeli flag from an 88-year-old man, in paragraphs 32 and 34 as follows:
“Mr.
Sacke
attended
the
rally
and
carried
the Israeli flag to draw attention to the
kidnapped
hostages
and
to
support
each
other. He and everyone
have the right to peacefully assemble,
to
gather
and
to
express
their
views.
Ms. Abed chose to provoke them, to engage
in
conduct
intended
to
undermine
their right to peacefully assemble and
their sense of
peace
and
security,
in
the
context
of
what is
going
on
in
the
world.
Ms.
Abed
intended to and did violate Mr. Sacke’s
and his community’s
sense
of
peace
and
security.
It was
meant
to
show
their
assembly
and
support
cannot be expressed publicly without being met
by
aggressive
behaviour.”
The
court
would
find
that
there
is
a
striking
parallel in this case, as Mr. Elkhodary approached the victim, who had the
right to peacefully indicate her views, by putting up posters
on
Yonge
Street.
Mr.
Elkhodary
chose to provoke her, by tearing down the
posters right in front of her.
His
actions, in the presence
of
his
common
law
spouse,
culminated in physical violence to this
smaller woman, who
was
alone.
He
pushed
her
and
then
struck
her in the head.
In
addition,
the
court
has
considered
all
of
the cases referred to by the defence. In
R.
v.
Gillard
,
2022
ONCJ
164
,
the
court
considered
a
case
related
to
hate
motivation. However, there were many
distinguishing features, most particularly related to the entry of a guilty
plea, saving the victim from
having
to
testify.
Secondly,
he
was
a
youthful
first offender, with unique mental health issues, related to an Impulsive
disorder, a seizure disorder, and physically affected by the heat.
He is in need of medication
for
his
condition.
He
also
had
an
indigenous
background.
The
court
did
not
find
that
case
helpful
in
considering
the subject case.
In
R.
v.
Ghaddar,
2018
ONCJ
959
,
the
court
considered
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea
after the
victim
had
testified.
It
was
a
case
of intra-familial violence, and not a
hate motivated offence.
There were
potential immigration related consequences.
He
had also
completed
53
hours
of
community
service, and the court ultimately imposed
a conditional
discharge.
Both
the
facts
of
the offence and the offender are very
unlike the case at bar.
Mr. Elkhodary
has done no community
service
to
the
knowledge
of
this
court.
In
R.
v.
Brown
,
2005
Can
LII
24762
,
a
summary
conviction appeal decision of Justice Durno, the
court
considered
a
case
of
intra-familial
violence, which was a push, where the trial judge
imposed
an
absolute
discharge.
It
was not a hate motivated offence.
The court ultimately dismissed the appeal
against sentence.
The
test
for
overturning
a sentence
imposed
at
trial
is
somewhat
different
from
the
court’s
consideration
of
imposition
of
sentence
after
trial.
In
R.
v.
Barilko
,
2014
ONSC
1145
,
the
court considered another
case of sentence for intra-familial
violence,
with
no
aspects
of being a hate motivated offence.
In
R. v.
Allen
,
2019 ONSC 971
, the court considered
sentence
after
the
accused
had been found guilty of assault.
It was not a hate motivated offence.
The parties were together to celebrate an
event.
While the accused
threw
the
first
punch,
the
victim
was on top of him after that, which made
it impossible
for
the
accused
to
otherwise
hurt him.
The accused was 23 years old, and the father of two young children.
Another accused was the one who caused
injuries. This case is very different than the one at
bar.
In
R.
v.
Marshall
,
2021
ONCA
344
,
the
court considered the credit for
pre-sentence custody credit, being
Summers
and
Duncan
credit.
The court has considered the submission
of
the
defence
in
the
case
at
bar and does not find this case to be of
assistance.
There
is
no
such
credit
in
this
case.
In
R.
v.
Mills
,
2022
ONCA
404
,
the
court
in
a very short endorsement, considered the
sentence of a tow truck driver who pled guilty to fraud under $5,000.
The offence was not hate motivated.
A psychological assessment revealed a
prior diagnosis of a learning disability as a child.
He had low level functioning as revealed in cognitive tests
and
had
suffered
from
a
number
of
head traumas that required
hospitalization.
He also experienced
serious episodes of anxiety and depression and had engaged in self-harm. A
conditional sentence was imposed by the trial
judge,
but
the
court
ultimately
allowed the appeal and imposed a conditional discharge.
While
a
conditional
discharge
can be
imposed for certain types of offences and offenders, this case is not helpful
to this
court.
The
defence
also
relied
upon
R.
v.
Chapman
,
2008 ONCJ 552
, arguing that this was a de minimus type of assault.
The facts in the case
at
bar
provide
a
context
which
support
it not being an offence of de minimus.
Where
a
defendant
enters
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
a
trial
follows,
this
not
an
aggravating factor.
A guilty plea saving the need for witnesses to testify at trial
can be a mitigating factor.
The
absence of a guilty plea
is
neutral.
As
the
Court
of
Appeal
for
Ontario noted in
R. v.
Kakekagamick
,
2006 CanLII 28549 (ON CA)
, [2006] OJ No. 3346, the “failure to accept responsibility
for
his
actions
weighs
against affording him
significant consideration by way of mitigation”.
Judicial
restraint:
The court
specifically considers the principle
of
judicial
restraint.
Currently it is
codified in
section 718.2
. of the
Criminal Code
.
The court also specifically considers
this
principle
as
it
relates
to
Mr. Elkhodary, a first
offender, although he is not tremendously youthful.
In that regard, the court considers the combination of
R. v.
Proulx¸
2000
SCC
5
,
together
with
the
Ontario Court of Appeal decision in
R.
v. Priest
1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA)
, [1996], OJ No. 3369.
The
Ontario Court of Appeal judgment in
Priest
predated the availability
of
conditional
sentences.
While the
Priest
judgment related to property offences,
the principle which has emerged from
its
consideration
of
the
case
is
that the court should explore all other
dispositions before imposing a custodial sentence.
This principle followed the court’s
earlier
case
in
R.
v.
Stein
(1974),
1974 CanLII 1615 (ON CA)
, 15
C.C.C.
2d
376,
O.C.A.,
at
page
377,
a
judgment
authored
by
Martin,
JA.
The
court also held that for a first term of imprisonment,
the
length
should
be
as
short as
possible.
Proulx
has
made
it
clear
that
a
sentence
of
incarceration
should
only
be imposed
if
a
conditional
sentence
is
not
appropriate.
This court considers
the judgment of the Court
of
Appeal
for
Ontario
in
R.
v.
Batisse
(2009),
2009 ONCA 114 (CanLII)
, 93 O.R. 3d 643, at paragraphs
32 to
34
.
The principle of
restraint for a first offender
requires
the
sentencing
judge
to consider all sanctions apart from incarceration,
and
where
incarceration
is imposed, to impose a term as short as possible and tailored
to the individual circumstances
of
the
accused,
following
R.
v. Priest
.
Secondly,
it
requires
the
sentencing
judge to consider rehabilitation.
Thirdly,
where the case is serious and involves violence,
general
deterrence
and
denunciation
are also significant factors to be
considered.
Overall, the
court finds that denunciation and general deterrence are important principles
for
the
court
to
consider
in
this case.
However, the court also considers
rehabilitation,
given
that
Mr.
Elkhodary
is
a first offender.
Judicial restraint is similarly
an
important
factor
in
this
case.
Considering the law as it relates to this type
of
offence,
and
the
circumstances
of
the offender, the
court finds that an absolute discharge, or even a conditional discharge, given
the aggravating factors in this case, would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
Similarly,
the
court
finds
that
a
suspended sentence would be woefully inadequate to address
the
relevant
sentencing
principles, including the primary principles of denunciation
and
deterrence
for
this
type
of
offence.
The court is mindful of the
aggravating
factors
noted
above,
and
as
well
the principle of judicial restraint for a first offender.
All in all, a suspended sentence would not
be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
of
the
offender
in
this
case.
The
court goes on to consider whether a conditional
sentence
would
properly
address the principles of denunciation and deterrence, together with
rehabilitation, given
the
aggravating
factors
in
this
case,
including the victim and community impact.
Conditional
Sentence:
The
Crown
has
submitted
that
a
conditional sentence would be appropriate
for this offender
and
this
offence.
The
court
must consider
the
provision
for
this
type
of
sentence,
as
set
out
in
section
742.1
of
the
Criminal
Code.
In this regard the
court would note that pursuant
to
the
positions
of
the
parties,
the sentence under consideration is one of less than two years.
The
court
must
also
consider
section
742.1(a) and whether
the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of
the
community
and
would
be
consistent
with the fundamental purpose and
principles of sentencing
set
out
in
sections
718
to
718.2, together with;
(b)
the
offence
is
not
an
offence
punishable by a minimum term of
imprisonment;
Subsections
(c)
and
(d)
are
not
relevant
to
the
court’s
consideration
in
this
case.
The court
must therefore first determine whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment
would
be
available.
This
is
the sentence sought by the Crown.
It is a term of
incarceration,
but
one
to
be
served
in
the
community.
The
Crown
proceeded
summarily.
The
offence
is not punishable by a minimum term
of imprisonment.
The sentence under
consideration
pursuant
to
the
positions
of counsel, as indicated, is less than two years.
The court finds that for this offender,
with
no
prior
criminal
record,
and who has not been charged with
breaching any terms of bail, that the safety of the community would not be
endangered by Mr. Elkhodary serving his sentence in the
community.
The
court
considers
whether
a
conditional
sentence would satisfy the fundamental purpose, principles and objectives of sentencing,
as
set
out
in
sections
718
to
718.2
of
the
Criminal
Code,
for
this
offence
and this offender.
The case law is
clear that the paramount principles and primary sentencing objectives for a
case of this nature are denunciation and deterrence.
As noted, the court also considers rehabilitation
as
an
important
principle
and objective for
Mr. Elkhodary as a first offender.
Courts
have been clear that in some cases, a conditional sentence may satisfy
the
principles
of
denunciation
and deterrence;
R.
v.
Proulx
,
2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)
, [2000]
1
S.C.R.
61,
at paragraphs
102 and 107
,
R.
v.
Wismayer
(1997),
1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA)
, 33 O.R. (3d)
225 (C.A.).
In
Proulx
,
at
paragraph
96
,
the
Supreme
Court
of Canada specifically considered the
principle and objective of judicial restraint,
pursuant
to
section
718.2
(d),
that is to say, that
an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions
may be appropriate in the circumstances.
However,
the court stated that
this
principle,
is
of
course,
not
solely determinative, but
involves a more comprehensive consideration.
As stated in that
paragraph,
“a
determination
of
when
less restrictive sanctions are
"appropriate" and alternatives
to
incarceration
"reasonable"
in
the
circumstances
requires
a
consideration
of the
other
principles
of
sentencing
set
out
in
sections 718
to
718.2
.
So,
this is but one of
the
principles
and
objectives
to
consider.
The court must have regard to both the seriousness
of
the
offence
and
the
offender’s degree of responsibility.”
In this
case, the court also considers that Mr.
Elkhodary
would
be
suitable
for
a
term
of GPS
monitoring, as indicated in the assessment
put
in
evidence
before
this
court, in the event the
court imposes a conditional
sentence.
In all of
the circumstances, the court finds that a conditional sentence, rather than a
term
of
incarceration
to
be
served
in
a
jail, would adequately express society’s condemnation
for
the
conduct
of
Mr.
Elkhodary
in this
case, and achieve the required deterrent
effect.
It
would
also
permit
him to continue on his path of seeking
employment, and for the court to order rehabilitation
in
the
form
of
counseling.
Accordingly,
the court imposes a conditional sentence
five
months
in
length.
The
court
is going to deal with the actual terms in
a moment,
given
that
defence
counsel
has
sought the opportunity to
address the court in the middle of the sentence with respect to the nature of
the conditional sentence and the terms as it relates to house arrest and
curfew.
********
Wednesday,
November 5,
2025
BROWN,
J:
(Orally)
As I have
indicated, I have already done reasons on the earlier date that I have released
orally with respect to the matter. It is a conditional sentence as the court
has indicated. It is approximately five months, but the court has broken it up
into 150 days.
The first 50
days will involve a house arrest term, with exceptions that are set out below.
The next 50 days will involve a restrictive curfew, as set out below.  And the
final 50 days will involve a less restrictive curfew.
There will be a requirement that the GPS monitoring equipment, of
which there has been an assessment done, be worn to monitor those terms for
compliance. The court will address the specific terms relating to those
portions as follows in just a moment. However, due to the GPS electronic
monitoring, it will have the standard terms, which include the following, and
this will be throughout the whole 150 days:
You shall report immediately to the supervisor for the purpose of
arranging your enrolment in the electronic supervision program.
You shall participate and abide by the rules and regulations of that
program as required by your conditional sentence supervisor and/or designated
electronic supervision resource officer, for the purpose of monitoring your house
arrest, home curfew, residence restriction, et cetera.
You shall be placed on electronic supervision for the full
conditional sentence, which is 150 days. You shall make yourself available,
either by phone or in person, as may be required, at any time during house
arrest/home confinement/curfew, and in particular, you shall answer the phone
at any time during house arrest/home confinement/curfew, and present yourself
to Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services staff, police
services and/or persons who are authorized by the Ministry of Community Safety
and Correctional Services associated with the Electronic Supervision Program at
the door of your residence at any time during house arrest/home
confinement/curfew for the purpose of confirming your presence and compliance
You are to reside at [address removed], which is an address approved
by your supervisor and/or designate and you are not to change your address
without prior permission of your supervisor.
You shall permit Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional
Services staff and/or police services in your residence during the
investigation of any alerts; either technical (ie. Transmitter battery low) or
compliance issue (ie. Subject leaving during curfew), generated while on the Electronic
Supervision Program.
You are to report to your supervisor within three working days and
thereafter as required.
You are to attend for any assessment and counseling as directed by
your supervisor, for anger management, and to sign releases or consents to
permit your supervisor to monitor your attendance at those appointments.
You are to have no direct or indirect contact with Vicki Moscoe.
You are not to be within 100 metres of any place of residence,
employment, worship, or locations regularly attended or attended at the time by
Vicki Moscoe.
You are not to possess any weapons as defined by the
Criminal
Code
.
You are not to possess any knives outside of your residence, and
there is no exception to that term.
Then as it relates to the splitting of the conditional sentence into
three sections:
As indicated, for the first 50 days of the conditional sentence,
there shall be a term requiring house arrest. Accordingly, you are to reside at
the address approved in advance by your supervisor, which I set out earlier,
and you are not to move from that address without prior approval of your
supervisor.
Now with respect to that, and I think Mr. Dorsz has already
explained this to you, you are to remain in your residence and there will be no
exceptions to the house arrest until the GPS monitoring equipment is installed
at your residence, but typically it is done the same day, particularly if your
lawyer takes you to probation, just outside the courtroom. It is on a floor in
this building and you can get the process started and they can meet you there.
After the GPS monitoring equipment is installed, the following
exceptions to house arrest for the first 50 days will apply:
Medical emergencies for yourself. Medical appointments and
counselling appointments for yourself. Travel to and directly from and while at
any position of employment, but you are to return immediately back to your
residence. Two hours per week for personal matters, on Saturdays from two to
four p.m., and as well appointments with your supervisor.
As it relates to any exception for medical appointments and
counselling, and any employment position, you shall provide to the supervisor
your schedule of these appointments and employment hours and location, and the
supervisor will incorporate these into a written letter of permission to be out
of your residence and that letter is to be carried by you on your person at all
times while out of the residence.
Then, for the next 50 days of your conditional sentence, you are to
abide by a curfew from six p.m. to eight a.m., each and every day of the week,
and there will be an exception for medical emergencies. Earlier counsel
indicated there was no other exception being sought to that curfew.
Then for the final 50 days of your conditional sentence, there will
be a curfew from ten p.m. to eight a.m., with an exception for medical
emergencies for you.
This conditional sentence will be followed by a period of 12 months
probation
,
with the following terms of probation:
You are to report to your supervisor within three working days after
completion of your conditional sentence, and thereafter as required.
You are to attend for any assessment and counseling as directed by
your supervisor for anger management, and to sign releases or consents to
permit your supervisor to monitor your attendance.
You are to have no direct or indirect contact with Vicki Moscoe.
You are not to be within 100 metres of any place of residence,
employment, worship, or locations regularly attended, or places where Vicki
Moscoe would happen to be.
You are not to possess any weapons as defined by the
Criminal
Code
.
You are not to possess any knives outside of your residence, and
there is no exception to that term.
Do you understand your terms of probation?
OMAR ELKHODARY: Yes.
THE COURT: Do you understand the terms of your conditional sentence?
OMAR ELKHODARY: Yes.
THE COURT: Are you able to comply with the terms?
OMAR ELKHODARY: Yes.
THE COURT: It’s very important that you do. If you break any of the
terms of your conditional sentence, you could be charged with breach of your
conditional sentence. If that happens, you can be brought back before the court
and generally speaking, you would be brought back before me, because I am the
judge that imposed this conditional sentence. One of the consequences that might
happen if you’re found guilty of the breaching the conditional sentence is that
you may be required to serve the balance of that conditional sentence in jail
as straight jail time. So it is very serious if you break your conditional
sentence.
If you break any terms of probation, you could be charged with that.
That is a criminal offence called fail to comply with probation. You could be
charged with breaching that probation order and brought back before the court.
And if you are found guilty of breaking that probation order, a sentence can be
imposed which can also include jail, so it is very important you comply with
all the terms of your probation order.
There will also be ancillary orders imposed. Firstly, there will be
a section 110 weapons prohibition order for a period of five years.
Next there will be a DNA order for the secondary designated offence
of assault. So the court officer will take you for you to provide the sample
for the DNA.
And the victim fine surcharge will be imposed, but the court will
give you one year within which to make payment of the victim fine surcharge.
Is there any question, any clarification counsel want?
G. DORSZ: In my experience lately, although it changes all the time,
the DNA order would actually have a date for him to attend and provide that,
given that he’s not in custody.
THE COURT: It would be right after.
G. DORSZ: Okay, that’s fine.
THE COURT: So typically, Mr. Dorsz, I don’t know if we are going to
say 12 o’clock or one o’clock, but he would be taken to do that right away, and
then if you are able to wait or if you are able just to direct him to go to the
probation office...
G. DORSZ: Yes.
THE COURT: ...right after that. Because he has to go with the court
officer to do the DNA...
G. DORSZ: Absolutely.
THE COURT: ...but then he’s free to go to the probation after that
to report for the conditional sentence.
G. DORSZ: I’ll make sure to guide him appropriately.
THE COURT: Okay. All right, any other questions from counsel?
G. DORSZ: No thank you.
THE COURT: From the clerks?
CLERK OF THE COURT: Yes, for the CSO, it’s report today?
THE COURT: Yes.
CLERK OF THE COURT: Thank you.
THE COURT: All right, I thank counsel very much for their work and
their assistance in this regard. As I have indicated, I have sent the
transcript of the reasons. I didn’t have time, even now, because I didn’t even
make it back to my office, I was working right through the recess, to give a
hard copy of the reasons, but counsel can print them should they wish to have
them.
G. DORSZ: Absolutely, Your Honour. And I did receive the email with
the reasons.
THE COURT: All right, thank you. As I said, I will be ordering the
balance of my reasons from today and then most likely I think what we are going
to do is upload both of them collectively as the reasons for sentence.
G. DORSZ: Great. Thank you, Your Honour.
THE COURT: All right, thank you.
