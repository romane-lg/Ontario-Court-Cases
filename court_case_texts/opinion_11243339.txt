CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

  No. 24–808.      Argued November 4, 2025—Decided January 20, 2026


The question in this case is whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
  60(c)(1)’s requirement that parties make Rule 60(b) motions within a
  “reasonable time” applies to a motion seeking relief from an allegedly
  void judgment under Rule 60(b)(4). Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, en-
  tered bankruptcy in 2014 and initiated adversarial proceedings
  against Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., to collect $50,000 in
  allegedly unpaid invoices. Vista-Pro attempted to serve process on Co-
  ney Island by mail but purportedly failed to comply with Federal Rule
  of Bankruptcy Procedure 7004(b)(3)’s mail-service requirements. Co-
  ney Island did not file an answer, and the Bankruptcy Court entered
  a default judgment. Over the next six years, Vista-Pro’s bankruptcy
  trustee attempted to enforce the judgment. These efforts bore fruit in
  2021 when a marshal seized funds from Coney Island’s bank account
  in satisfaction of the judgment. Coney Island filed a motion to vacate
  the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, arguing that
  Vista-Pro’s failure to make proper service rendered the judgment void.
  The Bankruptcy Court denied relief, holding that Coney Island failed
  to abide by Rule 60’s requirement that parties make motions for relief
  within a “reasonable time.” The District Court and the Court of Ap-
  peals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held: Rule 60(c)(1)’s reasonable-time limit applies to a motion alleging
 that a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 2–6.
    (a) The plain text of Rule 60(c)(1) provides that a “motion under Rule
 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time,” and because a motion
2         CONEY ISLAND AUTO PARTS UNLIMITED, INC. v.
                          BURTON
                          Syllabus

    for relief from an allegedly void judgment is a “motion under Rule
    60(b),” the reasonable-time limit applies. The structure of Rule 60 con-
    firms the plain-text interpretation. Rule 60 expressly modifies the de-
    fault reasonable-time limit, imposing a one-year limit on Rule 60(b)
    motions alleging mistakes, new evidence, or fraud. Yet the Rule does
    not include an analogous unlimited-time principle for motions alleging
    voidness. Pp. 2–3.
       (b) The Court rejects the argument that because a “void judgment is
    a legal nullity,” United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U. S.
    260, 270, no time limit should apply. Even if the passage of time can-
    not cure voidness, the same principle holds true for most legal errors,
    yet statutes and rules routinely limit the time during which a party
    can seek relief from a judgment infected by error. A party would need
    to show that some principle of law, such as the Due Process Clause,
    gives a party the right to allege voidness at any time, but Coney Island
    disclaims any such argument, and the Court cannot divine any such
    principle. Allowing parties to allege voidness at any time would have
    extreme implications, such as allowing parties to ignore deadlines for
    filing notices of appeal or petitions for certiorari when subject-matter
    jurisdiction is contested. The possibility that improper service is dif-
    ferent from other legal errors because a party might not learn about
    proceedings until long after judgment issues does not help Coney Is-
    land. Rule 60(c)(1) accommodates such a scenario by imposing a rea-
    sonable-time requirement rather than a fixed time limit. In the con-
    text of a default judgment, it might be reasonable for a defendant not
    to seek relief before learning about a plaintiff’s attempted enforce-
    ment. Pp. 3–5.
       (c) The Court rejects Coney Island’s argument that courts have his-
    torically allowed litigants to seek relief from void judgments at any
    time. No such historical consensus exists, and in any event, for Rule
    60(b) motions, the Rule’s text and structure take priority over histori-
    cal practice. The Court also rejects Coney Island’s reliance on Insur-
    ance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S.
    694, as that case undermines Coney Island’s plea for no time limits.
    Lastly, the Court rejects Coney Island’s invocation of policy concerns,
    Rule 60’s drafting history, and the canon of constitutional avoidance.
    To the extent that these interpretive tools carry any weight, they do so
    only when a Rule’s language is ambiguous. Pp. 5–6.
109 F. 4th 438, affirmed.

            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
                               [January 20, 2026]

  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
  A party seeking relief from an allegedly void judgment
may file a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b)(4). Rule 60(c)(1) requires parties to make Rule 60(b)
motions within a “reasonable time.” We hold that this time
limit applies to a motion alleging that a judgment is void.
                                I
  Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, entered bankruptcy in 2014.
As part of its bankruptcy litigation, Vista-Pro initiated ad-
versarial proceedings against Coney Island Auto Parts Un-
limited, Inc., to collect $50,000 in allegedly unpaid invoices.
Vista-Pro attempted to serve process on Coney Island by
mail, but in doing so, it purportedly failed to comply with
the mail-service requirements in Federal Rule of Bank-
ruptcy Procedure 7004(b)(3).
  Coney Island did not file an answer in the adversarial
proceedings, and the Bankruptcy Court entered a default
judgment against the company in 2015. Over the next six
years, Vista-Pro’s bankruptcy trustee attempted to enforce
2       CONEY ISLAND AUTO PARTS UNLIMITED, INC. v.
                         BURTON
                    Opinion of the Court

that judgment against Coney Island. As part of these ef-
forts, the trustee sent a demand letter to the company’s
CEO in April 2016. Lower courts concluded that this letter
gave Coney Island notice of the judgment and the trustee’s
enforcement efforts.
   These efforts bore fruit in 2021 when a marshal seized
funds from Coney Island’s bank account in satisfaction of
the judgment. In response, Coney Island filed a motion to
vacate the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
60. According to Coney Island, Vista-Pro’s failure to make
proper service rendered the judgment void.
   The Bankruptcy Court denied relief. It held that Coney
Island failed to abide by Rule 60’s requirement that parties
make motions for relief within a “reasonable time.” The
District Court and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed. We granted certiorari to resolve a split of author-
ity on whether Rule 60’s reasonable-time limit applies to
motions seeking relief from allegedly void judgments.1 605

                         Opinion of the Court

grant relief from a “void” judgment.2 Parties may seek re-
lief under Rule 60 by filing a motion with the court.
   Rule 60 also imposes a time limit for such motions. Rule
60(c)(1) provides that a “motion under Rule 60(b) must be
made within a reasonable time.” Because a motion for relief
from an allegedly void judgment is a “motion under Rule
60(b),” the reasonable-time limit applies. Accord, Kemp v.
United States, 596 U. S. 528, 533 (2022) (“All [Rule 60(b)
motions] must be filed ‘within a reasonable time’ ”).
   The structure of Rule 60 confirms what the plain text of
subdivision (c)(1) provides. When Rule 60 modifies the de-
fault reasonable-time limit, it does so expressly. For exam-
ple, Rule 60(c)(1) imposes a 1-year limit on Rule 60(b) mo-
tions alleging mistakes, new evidence, or fraud. Thus, one
would expect Rule 60 to include an analogous provision if a
special, unlimited-time principle applied to motions alleg-
ing voidness. Cf. Kemp, 596 U. S., at 534–535. But the Rule
does not.
   Coney Island, several Courts of Appeals, and a promi-
nent treatise nonetheless maintain that Rule 60(c)(1)’s
reasonable-time limit does not apply to motions alleging
voidness. See n. 1, supra; 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2862, pp. 431–433
(3d ed. 2012). These authorities acknowledge that their in-
terpretation clashes with Rule 60’s text. See, e.g., Sea-Land
Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II, Inc., 160 F. 3d 849, 852
(CA1 1998). But relying on the generally accepted maxim
that a “void judgment is a legal nullity,” United Student Aid
Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U. S. 260, 270 (2010), they ar-
gue that the passage of time cannot turn such a nullity into
an enforceable judgment. See, e.g., Austin v. Smith, 312
F. 2d 337, 343 (CADC 1962).

                         BURTON
                    Opinion of the Court

   This argument cannot bear the weight that Coney Island
and others have placed on it. Even if the passage of time
cannot cure voidness, the same principle holds true for most
legal errors. Nevertheless, statutes and rules routinely
limit the time during which a party can seek relief from a
judgment infected by error. Therefore, a party in Coney Is-
land’s position would need to show that some principle of
law, such as the Due Process Clause, gives a party the right
to allege voidness at any time.
   Coney Island disclaims any such argument, and we can-
not divine any principle requiring courts to keep their doors
perpetually open to allegations of voidness. Giving a party
a “reasonable” time to seek relief from an allegedly void
judgment may well be all that due process demands. By
contrast, the argument that a party may allege voidness at
any time, if taken to its logical conclusion, would have ex-
treme implications. For example, if a federal district court
erroneously concluded that it possessed subject-matter ju-
risdiction and proceeded to enter a judgment, the adversely
affected party could wait as long as it wanted before filing
a notice of appeal. But see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1).
Similarly, if a federal court of appeals erroneously asserted
subject-matter jurisdiction, the adversely affected party
would not be required to comply with the deadline for filing
a petition for a writ of certiorari imposed by this Court’s
Rule 13. It is hard to accept the proposition that due pro-
cess requires such a regime.3


——————
   3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that we should abstain from addressing

any potential due-process considerations. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in
judgment). Although Coney Island disclaims any constitutional argu-
ment, it cites a longstanding consensus of authority holding that a party
may allege voidness at any time despite the contrary language in Rule
60. And the only possible basis for such a holding is a rule of constitu-
tional law that prevents the imposition of the Rule’s reasonable-time re-
quirement.
                     Cite as: 607 U. S. ____ (2026)                     5

                          Opinion of the Court

   Coney Island maintains that the alleged defect in this
case—failure to perform proper service—is different from
other legal errors that might render a judgment void.4 Co-
ney Island emphasizes that when a party does not receive
proper service, it might not learn about the proceedings un-
til long after the judgment issues. But this possibility does
not help Coney Island’s position. Rule 60(c)(1) accommo-
dates such a scenario by imposing a reasonable-time re-
quirement, rather than a fixed time limit. And in the con-
text of a default judgment, it might be reasonable for a
defendant not to seek relief before learning about a plain-
tiff ’s attempted enforcement.
   Coney Island separately contends that courts have his-
torically allowed litigants to seek relief from void judgments
at any time. But the historical record is not so clear. To be
sure, courts have granted relief from void judgments long
after their entry, especially when the issuing court lacked
jurisdiction over the defendant. See, e.g., Harris v. Harde-
man, 14 How. 334, 338, 344–346 (1853) (affirming a lower
court order that set aside a judgment 11 years after its is-
suance where the plaintiff did not make proper service and
the defendant did not appear). But there was no historical
consensus that a party could request such relief at any time.
Some courts, for instance, concluded that laches or other
time limits could bar relief, even when a litigant alleged
voidness. E.g., Stocking v. Hanson, 35 Minn. 207, 211–212,
28 N. W. 507, 507–508 (1886); Smith v. Jones, 174 Cal. 513,
515–517, 163 P. 890, 890–892 (1917). In any event, for Rule
60(b) motions, the Rule’s “text and structure” take priority
over historical practice.5 See Honeycutt v. United States,
581 U. S. 443, 453 (2017).

——————
  4 We express no view on whether the allegedly defective service in this

case would render the judgment void.
  5 Rule 60(d) preserves parties’ ability to obtain relief from a judgment

in limited ways other than through a Rule 60(b) motion. We express no

                         BURTON
                    Opinion of the Court

  Coney Island turns next to this Court’s decision in Insur-
ance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,
456 U. S. 694 (1982). There, we explained that a defendant
seeking to dispute personal jurisdiction is “always free to
ignore the judicial proceedings, risk a default judgment,
and then challenge that judgment . . . in a collateral pro-
ceeding.” Id., at 706. Citing this sentence, Coney Island
argues that defendants need not comply with time limits
when alleging a lack of personal jurisdiction. But Insurance
Corp. also recognized that the “expression of legal rights is
often subject to certain procedural rules,” and “the failure
to enter a timely objection” may result in the loss of a legal
right. Id., at 705. Thus, Insurance Corp. undermines Co-
ney Island’s plea for no time limits.
  Coney Island lastly invokes policy concerns, Rule 60’s
drafting history, and the canon of constitutional avoidance.
To the extent that these interpretive tools carry any weight,
they do so only when a Rule’s language is ambiguous. See
BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S.
230, 245 (2021); Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U. S.
562, 572 (2011); Van Buren v. United States, 593 U. S. 374,
393–394 (2021). Here, the operative language clearly re-
quires parties to make Rule 60(b) motions within a reason-
able time.
                             III
  Litigants seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(4) must comply
with Rule 60(c)(1) and file a motion within a reasonable
time. Coney Island does not contend that it complied with
this requirement. Therefore, we need not expound on
whether Coney Island’s timing was reasonable. The judg-
ment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit is affirmed.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
                      [January 20, 2026]

   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring in the judgment.
   The Court today rightly holds that a Rule 60(b)(4) motion
to set aside a default judgment that is void for lack of per-
sonal jurisdiction must be made “within a reasonable time.”
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(c)(1). Rule 60’s text and structure
require that conclusion, as the majority explains.
   I concur in the judgment because the majority unneces-
sarily opines on the potential validity of a constitutional
challenge to the “reasonable time” limit under the Due Pro-
cess Clause. Ante, at 4. Coney Island did not make this
argument below and the Sixth Circuit did not pass upon it.
See In re Vista-Pro Automotive, LLC, 109 F. 4th 438, 443
(2024) (“Coney Island does not mount a constitutional at-
tack on Rule 60”). In this Court, Coney Island expressly
disclaimed any due process argument. See Brief for Peti-
tioner 22 (“To be clear, Coney Island does not contend that
Rule 60 or Rule 60(c)(1) [is] unconstitutional”). This Court
does “not generally entertain arguments that were not
raised below and are not advanced in this Court by any
party.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. 682,
721 (2014). There is no reason to depart from that practice
absent unusual circumstances, which certainly are not pre-
sent here.
